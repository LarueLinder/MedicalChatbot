It is the result of the body’s in-\\nflammatory response to a foreign body or a bacterial,\\nviral, parasitic, or fungal infection. An abscess usually\\ndries out and resolves when it is drained of pus. The\\nmost common parts of the body affected by abscesses\\nare the face, armpits, arms and legs, rectum, sebaceous\\nglands (oil glands), and the breast during lactation.\\nDescription\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means they are the\\nresult of an infection. Abscesses occur when white blood\\ncells (WBCs) gather in response to an infection. They pro-\\nduce oxidants (for example, superoxide radical) and en-\\nzymes to digest the invading bacteria, viruses, parasites, or\\nfungi. The infective agents are then broken down by the\\nWBCs into small pieces that can be transported through\\nthe bloodstream and eliminated from the body. Unfortu-\\nnately, the enzymes may also digest part of the body’s tis-\\nsues along with the infective agents. The resulting liquid\\nof this digestion is pus, which contains the remains of the\\ninfective agents, tissue, white blood cells, and enzymes.\\nA sterile abscess is one that is not produced by an\\ninfection. It is caused by irritants, such as foreign bodies\\nor injected drugs, and medications that have not been to-\\ntally absorbed. Sterile abscesses quite often heal into\\nhardened scar tissue.\\nCommon types of abscesses:\\n• Boils and carbuncles. Sebaceous glands and superficial\\nskin are the places usually infected.\\n• Dental abscess. An abscess that develops along the root\\nof a tooth.\\n• Pilonidal abscess. People who have a birth defect in-\\nvolving a tiny opening in the skin just above the anus\\nmay have fecal bacteria enter this opening, causing an\\ninfection and a subsequent abscess.\\n• Retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, peritonsillar abscess.\\nAs a result of throat infections like strep throat and\\ntonsillitis , bacteria invade the deeper tissues of the\\nthroat and cause a parapharyngeal or peritonsillar ab-\\nscess. A retropharyngeal abscess is a result of some-\\nthing usually blood-borne, and not from a direct spread\\nof tonsillitis. These abscesses can compromise swal-\\nlowing and even breathing.\\n• Lung abscess. During or after pneumonia, an abscess\\ncan develop as a complication.\\n• Liver abscess. Bacteria, parasites, or amoeba from the\\nintestines can spread through the blood to the liver and\\ncause abscesses.\\n• Psoas abscess. An abscess can develop in the psoas\\nmuscles, when an infection spreads from the appendix,\\nthe large intestine, or the fallopian tubes.\\n• Butin abscess. Any blood-borne feeding off bacteria\\nthat stimulate pus production (pyogenic organisms).\\nCan cause abscesses in possibly many sites.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nMany different agents cause abscesses. The most\\ncommon are the pyogenic, or pus-forming bacteria, such\\nas Staphylococcus aureus, which is nearly always the\\ncause of abscesses directly under the skin. Abscesses are\\nusually caused by organisms that normally inhabit near-\\nby structures or that infect them. For example, abscesses\\naround the anus may be caused by any of the numerous\\nbacteria found within the large intestine. Brain abscesses\\nand liver abscesses are caused by the bacteria, amoeba,\\nand fungi that are able to travel there through circulation.\\nA\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 1\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 1'),\n",

In addition, vitamins A and C, beta-carotene,zinc,\\nliquid chlorophyll, and garlic are useful as supportive\\ndaily nutrients to help clear up abscesses.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nOften, the pus of an abscess must be drained by a\\nphysician. Ordinarily, the body will handle the remain-\\ning infection. Sometimes antibiotics are prescribed. The\\ndoctor may often put a piece of cloth or rubber, called a\\ndrain, in the cavity of the abscess to prevent it from clos-\\ning until all the pus has drained.\\nExpected results\\nOnce the abscess is properly drained, it should clear\\nup in a few days. Any underlying diseases will determine\\nthe overall outcome of the condition. Recurrent abscesses,\\nespecially those on the skin, return due to either defec-\\ntive/altered immunity, or staph overgrowth, where there is\\nhigh bacterial colonization on the skin. The patient should\\nconsult a physician for treatment with which to wash the\\nskin areas, and treatment to eradicate colonization.\\nIf the abscess ruptures into neighboring areas or if\\nthe infectious agent spills into the bloodstream, serious\\nconsequences are likely. Abscesses in and around the\\nnasal sinuses, face, ears, and scalp may spread the infec-\\ntion into the brain. Abscesses in the abdominal cavity,\\nsuch as in the liver, may rupture into that cavity. Blood\\npoisoning, or septicemia, is an infection that has spilled\\ninto the bloodstream and then spreads throughout the\\nbody.

Acne is the general\\nname given to a skin disorder in which the sebaceous\\nglands become inflamed.(Photograph by Biophoto Associ-\\nates, Photo Researchers, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)\\nAcne\\nDefinition\\nAcne is a common inflammatory skin disease char-\\nacterized by pimples on the face, chest, and back. It oc-\\ncurs when the pores of the skin become clogged with oil,\\ndead skin cells, and/or bacteria.\\nDescription\\nAcne vulgaris, the medical term for common acne,\\nis the most common skin disease. It affects nearly 17\\nmillion people in the United States. While acne can arise\\nat any age, it usually begins at puberty and worsens dur-\\ning adolescence. Nearly 85% of people develop acne\\nsome time between the ages of 12 and 25 years old. Up\\nto 20% of women develop mild acne. It is also found in\\nsome newborns.\\nThe sebaceous glands lie just beneath the skin’s\\nsurface. They produce sebum, an oily secretion that\\nhelps to preserve the flexibility of the hair and moistur-\\nizes the skin. These glands and the hair follicles within\\nwhich they are found are called sebaceous follicles.\\nThese follicles open onto the skin through pores that\\nallow the sebum to reach the hair shaft and the skin. In\\ncertain situations, the glands excrete excess sebum and\\nit cannot be cleared from the pores efficiently. This\\nhappens, for instance, at puberty when increased levels\\nof the androgen hormones cause overproduction of\\nsebum. In addition, cells lining the follicle are shed too\\nquickly and begin to clump together. The excess sebum\\ncombines with the dead cells and forms a plug, or\\ncomedo (also called comedones), that blocks the pore,\\nwhich is not usually seen. When the follicle begins to\\nbulge and show up as a small whitish bump mostly\\nunder the skin, it is called a whitehead. If the comedo\\nopens up, the top surface of the plug darkens, and it is\\nreferred to as a blackhead.\\nInfection results when a plugged follicle is invaded\\nby Propionibacterium acnes, a bacteria that normally\\nlives on the skin, and possibly other microorganisms.\\nThe bacteria produce chemicals and enzymes that bring\\non inflammation. Pimples are the result of infected\\nblackheads or whiteheads that rupture, releasing sebum,\\nbacteria, dead skin, and white blood cells onto the sur-\\nrounding tissues. Inflamed pimples near the skin’s sur-\\nface are called papules; they are red and raised, and may\\nbe quite tender to the touch. The papules may become\\nfilled with pus, and are then called pustules. If the folli-\\ncle continues to enlarge rather than rupture, it forms a\\nclosed sac, called a cyst, which can be felt as a lump\\nunder the skin. Large hard swellings deep within the skin\\nare called nodules. Both nodules and cysts may cause\\npainand scarring.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe exact cause of acne is mostly unknown. Some-\\ntimes when acne in women is due to excess male hor-\\nmone production, it is diagnosed by an onset of the con-\\ndition in adulthood; excessive growth of hair, especially\\nin places not usual on a female, called hirsuitism; irregu-\\nlar menstrual cycles; and premenstrual flare-ups of acne.\\nA 2001 study demonstrated that menstrual cycle does af-\\nfect acne. Surprisingly, the study revealed that 53% of\\nwomen over age 33 experienced a higher premenstrual\\nacne rate than women under age 20.\\nMany alternative practitioners assert that acne is\\noften related to a condition of toxicity in the intestines or\\nliver. This may be due to the presence of bacteria such as\\nClostridia spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica, a low-fiber\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 5'),\n",

Several other factors have also been\\nshown to affect the condition:\\n• Age. Teenagers are more likely than anyone to develop\\nacne.\\n• Gender. Boys have more severe acne and develop it\\nmore often than girls.\\n• Disease. Hormonal disorders can complicate acne in\\ngirls.\\n• Heredity. Individuals with a family history of acne have\\ngreater susceptibility to the condition.\\n• Hormonal changes. Acne can flare up before menstru-\\nation, during pregnancy, and menopause.\\n• Diet. Although they are not the primary cause of acne,\\ncertain foods may bring on flare-ups or make the con-\\ndition worse.\\n• Drugs. Acne can be a side effect of antibiotics, oral\\ncontraceptives, and anabolic steroids.\\n• Personal hygiene. Use of abrasive soaps, hard scrub-\\nbing of the face, or handling pimples will often make\\nthem worse.\\n• Cosmetics. Oil-based makeup and hair sprays worsen\\nacne.\\n• Environment. Exposure to oils and greases, polluted\\nair, and sweating in hot weather can all aggravate acne.\\n• Stress. Emotional stress may contribute to acne.\\n• Friction. Continual pressure or rubbing on the skin by\\nsuch things as bicycle helmets, backpacks, or tight\\nclothing, as well as hard scrubbing of the skin, can\\nworsen acne.\\nThe most common sites of acne are the face, chest,\\nshoulders, and back, since these are the parts of the body\\nwhere the most sebaceous follicles are found. In\\nteenagers, acne is often found on the forehead, nose, and\\nchin. As people get older, it tends to appear towards the\\nouter part of the face. Adult women may have acne on\\ntheir chins and around their mouths. The elderly often de-\\nvelop whiteheads and blackheads on the upper cheeks and\\nskin around the eyes. Inflamed lesions may cause redness,\\npain, tenderness,itching, or swelling in affected areas.\\nDiagnosis\\nAcne has a characteristic appearance and is, there-\\nfore, not difficult to diagnose. A complete medical histo-\\nry should be taken, including questions about skin care,\\ndiet, factors that improve or worsen the condition, med-\\nication use, and prior treatment. Physical examination\\nincludes the face, upper neck, chest, shoulders, back, and\\nother affected areas. Under good lighting, the doctor can\\ndetermine what types and how many blemishes are pre-\\nsent, whether they are inflamed, whether they are deep\\nor superficial, and whether there is scarring or skin dis-\\ncoloration. Blood tests are done when the patient appears\\nto have hormonal or other medical problems. Stool tests\\ncan be helpful in determining whether there is a bacterial\\nor yeast overgrowth contributing to the condition. Food\\nallergy testing should also be considered.\\nTreatment\\nAlternative treatments for acne focus on proper\\ncleansing to keep the skin oil-free; intermittent fasting;\\neating a good diet; an elimination diet where the indi-\\nvidual avoids alcohol, dairy products, smoking ,\\ncaffeine , sugar, processed foods, and foods high in io-\\ndine, a mineral which appears to contribute to acne.\\nSupplementation with herbs that are blood cleansers\\nor blood purifiers is recommended. These herbs\\nstrengthen the action of the liver and the kidneys, help-\\ning with detoxification and excretion. Dandelion root\\ntincture (Taraxacum officinale) is recommended. Others\\ninclude burdock root (Arctium lappa ), also known as\\ngobo, and can be purchased fresh at health food grocers\\nor in Asian markets. It can be used either raw or cooked\\nin salads, stir-fries, or other vegetable dishes. Burdock\\nroot tincture can also be used. Red clover (Trifolium\\npratense ) makes a pleasant tea that can be consumed\\nthroughout the day. Milk thistle seed ( Silybum mari-\\nanum) can either be taken in tincture form or the seeds\\ncan be ground up and eaten in combination with hot ce-\\nreal, granola, or other foods.\\nOther herbs useful in the treatment of acne include\\nEchinacea spp. and goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis ).\\nGoldenseal is particularly helpful in clearing up underly-\\ning conditions of intestinal toxicity. Herbal remedies\\nused in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for acne\\ninclude cnidium seed, ( Cnidium monnieri), and honey-\\nsuckle flower (Lonicera japonica). Supplementation nu-\\ntrients, such as essential fatty acids (EFAs), vitamin B\\ncomplex, zinc, vitamin A or beta-carotene, and chromi-\\num are also recommended.\\nBowel toxicity may contribute to acne flare-ups, and\\nshould be addressed. Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lac-\\ntobacillus bulgaricus should be taken in yogurt or in\\ncapsules to maintain a healthy balance of intestinal flora.\\nGoldenseal can be used to kill toxic bacteria.

The fiber will absorb tox-\\nins and carry them through the colon to be excreted.\\nIn addition, those with acne may want to participate\\nin movement therapy, such as yoga or t’ai chi, or begin\\nan exercise regimen. The person may also consider\\nstress reduction or meditation.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAcne treatment consists of reducing sebum and ker-\\natin production, encouraging the shedding of dead skin\\ncells to help unclog the pores, and killing or limiting\\nbacteria. Treatment choice depends upon whether the\\nacne is mild, moderate, or severe. Complicated cases are\\nreferred to a dermatologist, or an endocrinologist, who\\ntreats diseases of the glands and the hormones. Counsel-\\ning may be necessary to clear up misconceptions about\\nthe condition and to offer support regarding the negative\\neffect of acne on the physical appearance.\\nTopical drugs\\nTreatment for mild acne consists of reducing the\\nformation of new comedones with over-the-counter acne\\nmedications containing benzoyl peroxide (e.g., Clearasil,\\nFostex), salicylic acid (Stridex),sulfur (Therac lotion),\\nresorcinol (Acnomel cream). Treatment with stronger\\nmedications requires a doctor’s supervision. Such med-\\nications include comedolytics, which are agents that\\nloosen hard plugs and open pores. Adapalene (Differin),\\nthe vitamin A acid tretinoin (Retin-A), and concentrated\\nversions of salicylic acid, resorcinol, and sulfur are in\\nthis group. Topical antibiotics, such as erythromycin,\\nclindamycin (Cleocin-T), and meclocycline (Meclan),\\nmay be added to the treatment regimen. Drugs that act as\\nboth comedolytics and antibiotics, such as benzoyl per-\\noxide, azelaic acid (Azelex), or benzoyl peroxide plus\\nerythromycin (Benzamycin), are also used.\\nAfter washing with a mild soap, the acne medica-\\ntions are applied alone or in combination, once or twice\\na day over the entire affected area of skin. It may take\\nmany months to years to control the condition with these\\nmedications. Possible side effects include mild redness,\\npeeling, irritation, dryness, and an increased sensitivity\\nto sunlight that requires use of a sunscreen.\\nOral drugs\\nWhen acne is severe and the lesions are deep, oral\\nantibiotics may be taken daily to reduce the spread of\\nbacteria. Tetracycline is the medication most often used.\\nMinocycline, however, may be more preferable because\\nit has fewer side effects. Erythromycin and doxycycline\\nare also used, and they also have side effects, including\\ndizziness, photosensitivity, gastrointestinal problems,\\nand darkening of the skin. Other possible side effects in-\\nclude allergic reactions, yeast infections , dizziness,\\ntooth discoloration, and folliculitis. It is necessary for\\nantibiotics to be used for up to three months to clear up\\nthe condition.\\nIsotretinoin (Accutane) can be used in cases of very\\nsevere acne, or if antibiotic therapy proves unsuccessful.\\nIt may clear up resistant cysts and nodules in up to 90%\\nof people and prevent scarring. Some do require a sec-\\nond course of treatment before this happens, however.\\nAlthough the medication can be quite helpful, women\\nwho might become pregnant should use it with care.\\nIsotretinoin can cause birth defects up to a month after it\\nhas stopped being used. Therefore, strict attention is paid\\nto pregnancy tests and contraceptive requirements for\\nwomen of child-bearing age who take this medication.\\nThe course of treatment with isotretinoin lasts about\\nfour to five months. If dosage is kept low, a longer\\ncourse of therapy is needed. Isotretinoin is a strong med-\\nication. Side effects are very common, mostly dryness of\\nthe eyes, genital mucosa, and lips. Other effects may in-\\nclude increases in cholesterol, tryglicerides, and abnor-\\nmal liver enzymes. Blood tests taken each month should\\nbe monitored during the course of treatment to ensure\\nthat the medication is not causing serious harm.\\nAnti-androgens, drugs that inhibit androgen produc-\\ntion, are used to treat women who are unresponsive to\\nother therapies. Oral contraceptives such as norgesti-\\nmate/ethinyl estradiol (Ortho-Tri-Cyclen) have been\\nshown to improve acne. In late 2001, a clinical trial\\ndemonstrated that ultra low-dose birth control pills\\n(Alesse) prove as effective in treating acne as do pills\\nwith higher doses of estrogen. Improvement may take up\\nto four months.\\nOther drugs, such as spironolactone and corticos-\\nteroids, may be used to reduce hormone activity in the\\nadrenal glands, reducing production of sebum. This is\\nthe treatment of choice for an extremely severe, but rare\\ntype of acne called acne fulminans, found mostly in ado-\\nlescent males. Acne conglobata, a more common form of\\nsevere inflammation, is characterized by numerous,\\ndeep, inflammatory nodules that heal with scarring. It is\\ntreated with oral isotretinoin and corticosteroids.\\nOther types of treatment\\nSeveral surgical or medical treatments are available\\nto alleviate acne or the resulting scars:\\n• Comedone extraction.

The more popular remedy, Aconi-\\ntum napellus , is a plant that grows in mountainous re-\\ngions of Central Asia, Russia, Europe, and Great Britain.\\nThis perennial plant from the Ranunculaceae family\\ngrows to a height of 3 ft (1 m) and has dark green, glossy\\nleaves and dark blue flowers.\\nOther names for aconite are wolf’s bane, monks-\\nhood, blue rocket, and friar’s cap. Wolf’s bane is a direct\\ntranslation of the Greek word Lycotonum . The Greeks\\nleft the plant as poisonous bait for wolves or anointed ar-\\nrows with the juice of the herb in order to kill wolves.\\nThe plant was nicknamed monkshood and friar’s cap be-\\ncause of the shape of the flowers.\\nThe plant in its fresh form is highly poisonous. The\\npoison comes from the toxic alkaloid aconitine. Aconi-\\ntine is found in the whole plant but is mainly concentrat-\\ned in the root. Symptoms of poisoning include tingling,\\nnumbness of the tongue and mouth,nausea and vomit-\\ning, labored breathing, a weak and irregular pulse, and\\ncold, clammy skin. Even the smallest amounts of aconi-\\ntine inside the mouth cause burning, tingling, and numb-\\nness. As little as 2 mg of aconitine can cause death in as\\nlittle as 4 hours, which may be one reason why aconite is\\noften chosen by people attempting suicide by poison.\\nThe Australian government has declared all species of\\naconite “unfit for human consumption.”\\nGeneral use\\nWestern herbology\\nHerbalists have used aconite as a medicine for hun-\\ndreds of years. However, in ancient times the herb was\\nknown more for its power to kill rather than heal; it was\\noften used in ancient Rome to commit murders.\\nThe herb acts as a diuretic (a substance that pro-\\nmotes urination) and diaphoretic (a substance that causes\\nsweating). Tinctures are taken internally to slow fevers,\\npneumonia, laryngitis, and acute tonsillitis. Liniments\\nor ointments made from the herb are applied externally\\nto relieve the pain of neuralgia and rheumatism.\\nTraditional Chinese medicine\\nAconitum carmichaeli is used in traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine. It is called Fu Zi (sometimes Fu Tzu) in\\nMandarin; in other parts of China and in Hong Kong it is\\nknown as chuan wou tou. . This herb is used to treat\\nrheumatism, bruises, arthritis, acute hypothermia, diar-\\nrhea, and impotence . The herb is very hot and has a\\nsweet, spicy taste.\\nThe main function of Fu Zi is to warm the interior. It\\nalso works to restore collapsed yang, warm Kidney fire,\\nwarm the Kidney and Spleen, drive out the cold, warm\\nthe meridians, and relieve pain. Fu Zi is also used by tra-\\nditional Chinese herbalists in conditions marked by defi-\\ncient Kidney and Spleen yang or in conditions with early\\nmorning diarrhea or lack of appetite.\\nAconitum carmichaeli also contains the toxic alka-\\nloid aconitine. After cooking the herb, the alkaloid is\\nconverted to aconine, which is not as toxic.\\nThis herb is poisonous. When it is properly prepared\\nas recommended by a Chinese medicine practitioner,\\nthere are rarely any adverse effects. Chinese pharmacies\\ndo not sell raw, untreated aconite, as the plant should be\\ndried and then brewed for long periods of time. There\\nhave been, however, cases of aconite poisoning reported\\nin Asian countries, including some that ended in the pa-\\ntient’s death from heart arrhythmias. It appears that most\\nof these cases are due either to the herbalist’s prescribing\\na larger dose of aconite than is needed, or to the patient’s\\nattempting to prepare the remedy at home.\\nHomeopathy\\nHomeopaths prescribe aconite for conditions that\\ncome on suddenly as a result of grief, fear, anger, shock,\\nor exposure to cold, dry wind. It is also recommended for\\npeople troubled by suicidal thoughts. The remedy is short-\\nacting and is indicated at the onset of acute conditions\\nsuch as croup, colds, cough, bronchitis, eye and ear in-\\nfections, headaches, and rheumatism. This remedy is one\\nof the best for measles, arthritis, and pneumonia when all\\nof the symptoms are present. Aconite is also useful at the\\nbeginning of a fever, in early stages of inflammation, and\\nfollowing shock caused by an injury or surgery.\\nPreparations\\nAconite is available as a homeopathic remedy or in\\ndried bulk form, as an ointment or liniment, and as a\\ntincture. Pharmacies, health food stores, and Chinese\\nherbal stores carry the various preparations. They are\\nalso available as prescribed by a herbalist, homeopathic\\ndoctor, or Chinese medicine practitioner.\\nThe whole plant is used in Western herbal medicine.\\nThe leaves and flowers are cut when the flowers are in\\nblossom in June. The roots are collected after the stem\\nhas died off, usually in August. The root is dried before\\nuse while the leaves, stems, and flowers are used fresh.\\nThe homeopathic preparation of aconite is created in\\nthe following manner. The whole plant—but not the\\nroot—is collected when the flowers are in full bloom and\\npounded to a pulp. The juice from the pulp is pressed\\nand mixed with alcohol. The mixture is then strained and\\ndiluted.

In\\nacupressure, the same points on the body are used as in\\nacupuncture, but are stimulated with finger pressure in-\\nstead of with the insertion of needles. Acupressure is\\nused to relieve a variety of symptoms and pain.\\nOrigins\\nOne of the oldest text of Chinese medicine is the\\nHuang Di, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal\\nMedicine, which may be at least 2,000 years old. Chinese\\nmedicine has developed acupuncture, acupressure, herbal\\nremedies, diet,exercise, lifestyle changes, and other\\nremedies as part of its healing methods. Nearly all of the\\nforms of Oriental medicine that are used in the West\\ntoday, including acupuncture, acupressure,shiatsu, and\\nChinese herbal medicine, have their roots in Chinese\\nmedicine. One legend has it that acupuncture and acu-\\npressure evolved as early Chinese healers studied the\\npuncture wounds of Chinese warriors, noting that certain\\npoints on the body created interesting results when stimu-\\nlated. The oldest known text specifically on acupuncture\\npoints, the Systematic Classic of Acupuncture, dates back\\nto 282 A.D. Acupressure is the non-invasive form of\\nacupuncture, as Chinese physicians determined that stim-\\nulating points on the body with massage and pressure\\ncould be effective for treating certain problems.\\nOutside of Asian-American communities, Chinese\\nmedicine remained virtually unknown in the United\\nStates until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon became the\\nfirst U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s trip, jour-\\nnalists were amazed to observe major operations being\\nperformed on patients without the use of anesthetics. In-\\nstead, wide-awake patients were being operated on, with\\nonly acupuncture needles inserted into them to control\\npain. At that time, a famous columnist for the New York\\nTimes, James Reston, had to undergo surgery and elected\\nto use acupuncture for anesthesia. Later, he wrote some\\nconvincing stories on its effectiveness. Despite being ne-\\nglected by mainstream medicine and the American Med-\\nical Association (AMA), acupuncture and Chinese medi-\\ncine became a central to alternative medicine practition-\\ners in the United States. Today, there are millions of pa-\\ntients who attest to its effectiveness, and nearly 9,000\\npractitioners in all 50 states.\\nAcupressure is practiced as a treatment by Chinese\\nmedicine practitioners and acupuncturists, as well as by\\nmassage therapists. Most massage schools in American\\ninclude acupressure techniques as part of their bodywork\\nprograms. Shiatsu massage is very closely related to acu-\\npressure, working with the same points on the body and\\nthe same general principles, although it was developed\\nover centuries in Japan rather than in China. Reflexology\\nis a form of bodywork based on acupressure concepts.\\nJin Shin Do is a bodywork technique with an increasing\\nnumber of practitioners in America that combines acu-\\npressure and shiatsu principles with qigong, Reichian\\ntheory, and meditation.\\nBenefits\\nAcupressure massage performed by a therapist can\\nbe very effective both as prevention and as a treatment\\nfor many health conditions, including headaches, general\\naches and pains, colds and flu, arthritis,allergies, asth-\\nma, nervous tension, menstrual cramps, sinus problems,\\nsprains, tennis elbow , and toothaches, among others.\\nUnlike acupuncture which requires a visit to a profes-\\nsional, acupressure can be performed by a layperson.\\nAcupressure techniques are fairly easy to learn, and have\\nbeen used to provide quick, cost-free, and effective relief\\nfrom many symptoms. Acupressure points can also be\\nstimulated to increase energy and feelings of well-being,\\nreduce stress, stimulate the immune system, and allevi-\\nate sexual dysfunction.\\nDescription\\nAcupressure and Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of\\nthe universe, subject to laws and principles of harmony\\nand balance. Chinese medicine does not make as sharp a\\ndestinction as Western medicine does between mind and\\nbody. The Chinese system believes that emotions and\\nmental states are every bit as influential on disease as\\npurely physical mechanisms, and considers factors like\\nwork, environment, and relationships as fundamental to a\\npatient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very different\\nsymbols and ideas to discuss the body and health. While\\nWestern medicine typically describes health as mainly\\nphysical processes composed of chemical equations and\\nreactions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, and\\nthe organ system to describe health and the body.\\nEverything in the universe has properties of yin and\\nyang. Yin is associated with cold, female, passive, down-\\nward, inward, dark, wet. Yang can be described as hot,\\nmale, active, upward, outward, light, dry, and so on.\\nNothing is either completely yin or yang. These two\\nprinciples always interact and affect each other, although\\nthe body and its organs can become imbalanced by hav-\\ning either too much or too little of either.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 11\\nAcupressure\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 11'),\n",

It involves the use of sharp,\\nthin needles that are inserted in the body at very specific\\npoints. This process is believed to adjust and alter the\\nbody’s energy flow into healthier patterns, and is used to\\ntreat a wide variety of illnesses and health conditions.\\nOrigins\\nThe original text of Chinese medicine is the Nei\\nChing, The Yellow Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medi-\\ncine, which is estimated to be at least 2,500 years old.\\nThousands of books since then have been written on the\\nsubject of Chinese healing, and its basic philosophies\\nspread long ago to other Asian civilizations. Nearly all of\\nthe forms of Oriental medicine which are used in the\\nWest today, including acupuncture,shiatsu, acupressure\\nmassage, and macrobiotics, are part of or have their roots\\nin Chinese medicine. Legend has it that acupuncture de-\\nveloped when early Chinese physicians observed unpre-\\ndicted effects of puncture wounds in Chinese warriors.\\nThe oldest known text on acupuncture, the Systematic\\nClassic of Acupuncture, dates back to 282 A.D. Although\\nacupuncture is its best known technique, Chinese medi-\\ncine traditionally utilizes herbal remedies, dietary thera-\\npy, lifestyle changes and other means to treat patients.\\nIn the early 1900s, only a few Western physicians\\nwho had visited China were fascinated by acupuncture,\\nbut outside of Asian-American communities it remained\\nvirtually unknown until the 1970s, when Richard Nixon\\nbecame the first U.S. president to visit China. On Nixon’s\\ntrip, journalists were amazed to observe major operations\\nsure and acupuncture. However, a body of research is\\ngrowing that verifies the effectiveness in acupressure and\\nacupuncture techniques in treating many problems and\\nin controlling pain.\\nTraining & certification\\nThere are two routes to becoming trained in the skill\\nof acupressure. The first is training in traditional\\nacupuncture and Chinese medicine, which has many\\nschools and certifying bodies around the country. The\\nmajority of acupressure practitioners are trained as certi-\\nfied massage therapists, either as acupressure or shiatsu\\nspecialists.\\nThe Acupressure Institute provides certification and\\nresources for acupressure practitioners.

In 2002,\\nthe National Institutes of health announced that pain\\nfrom certain musculoskeletal conditions like fibromyal-\\ngia could be helped by acupuncture. Acupuncture is lim-\\nited in treating conditions or traumas that require surgery\\nor emergency care (such as for broken bones).\\nDescription\\nBasic ideas of Chinese medicine\\nChinese medicine views the body as a small part of the\\nuniverse, and subject to universal laws and principles of har-\\nmony and balance. Chinese medicine does not draw a sharp\\nline, as Western medicine does, between mind and body.\\nThe Chinese system believes that emotions and mental states\\nare every bit as influential on disease as purely physical\\nmechanisms, and considers factors like work, environment,\\nlifestyle, and relationships as fundamental to the overall pic-\\nture of a patient’s health. Chinese medicine also uses very\\ndifferent symbols and ideas to discuss the body and health.\\nWhile Western medicine typically describes health in terms\\nof measurable physical processes made up of chemical reac-\\ntions, the Chinese use ideas like yin and yang, chi, the organ\\nsystem, and the five elements to describe health and the\\nbody. To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is\\nworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-\\nrate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.\\nFor example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.\\nIn gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin\\nis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and\\nyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward\\nand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever\\ncompletely yin or yang, but a combination of the two.\\nThese two principles are always interacting, opposing,\\nand influencing each other. The goal of Chinese medi-\\ncine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow\\nthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniously to-\\ngether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms\\nof high blood pressure, the Chinese system would say\\nthat the heart organ might have too much yang, and\\nwould recommend methods either to reduce the yang or\\nto increase the yin of the heart, depending on the other\\nsymptoms and organs in the body. Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or in-\\ncrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese medi-\\ncine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-\\nble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food\\nand sunlight. In the body, it is the invisible vital force that\\ncreates and animates life. We are all born with inherited\\namounts of chi, and we also get acquired chi from the\\nfood we eat and the air we breathe. The level and quality\\nof a person’s chi also depends on the state of physical,\\nmental and emotional balance. Chi travels through the\\nbody along channels called meridians.\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-\\nach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-\\nney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple\\nwarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each\\norgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organ\\ninteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. As\\nthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi\\nwhich can move through the body, and these move\\nthrough twelve main channels or meridians. Chinese\\ndoctors connect symptoms to organs. That is, symptoms\\nare caused by yin/yang imbalances in one or more or-\\ngans, or by an unhealthy flow of chi to or from one organ\\nto another. Each organ has a different profile of symp-\\ntoms it can manifest.\\nTHE FIVE ELEMENTS. Another basis of Chinese theo-\\nry is that the world and body are made up of five main\\nelements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. These ele-\\nments are all interconnected, and each element either\\ngenerates or controls another element. For instance,\\nwater controls fire and earth generates metal. Each organ\\nis associated with one of the five elements. The Chinese\\nsystem uses elements and organs to describe and treat\\nconditions. For instance, the kidney is associated with\\nwater and the heart is associated with fire, and the two\\norgans are related as water and fire are related. If the kid-\\nney is weak, then there might be a corresponding fire\\nproblem in the heart, so treatment might be made by\\nacupuncture or herbs to cool the heart system and/or in-\\ncrease energy in the kidney system.\\nThe Chinese have developed an intricate system of\\nhow organs and elements are related to physical and men-\\ntal symptoms, and the above example is a very simple one.\\nAlthough this system sounds suspect to Western scientists,\\nsome interesting parallels have been observed. For in-\\nstance, Western medicine has observed that with severe\\nheart problems, kidney failure often follows, but it still\\ndoes not know exactly why. In Chinese medicine, this con-\\nnection between the two organs has long been established.\\nMEDICAL PROBLEMS AND ACUPUNCTURE. In Chi-\\nnese medicine, disease as seen as imbalances in the\\norgan system or chi meridians, and the goal of any reme-\\ndy or treatment is to assist the body in reestablishing its\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 218\\nAcupuncture\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 18'),\n",

Disease can be caused by internal fac-\\ntors like emotions, external factors like the environment\\nand weather, and other factors like injuries, trauma, diet,\\nand germs. However, infection is seen not as primarily a\\nproblem with germs and viruses, but as a weakness in\\nthe energy of the body that is allowing a sickness to\\noccur. In Chinese medicine, no two illnesses are ever the\\nsame, as each body has its own characteristics of symp-\\ntoms and balance. Acupuncture is used to open or adjust\\nthe flow of chi throughout the organ system, which will\\nstrengthen the body and prompt it to heal itself.\\nA VISIT TO THE ACUPUNCTURIST. The first thing an\\nacupuncturist will do is get a thorough idea of a patient’s\\nmedical history and symptoms, both physical and emo-\\ntional. This is done with a long questionnaire and inter-\\nview. Then the acupuncturist will examine the patient to\\nfind further symptoms, looking closely at the tongue, the\\npulse at various points in the body, the complexion, gen-\\neral behavior, and other signs like coughs or pains. From\\nthis, the practitioner will be able to determine patterns of\\nsymptoms which indicate which organs and areas are\\nimbalanced. Depending on the problem, the acupunctur-\\nist will insert needles to manipulate chi on one or more\\nof the twelve organ meridians. On these twelve meridi-\\nans, there are nearly 2,000 points that can be used in\\nacupuncture, with around 200 points being most fre-\\nquently used by traditional acupuncturists. During an in-\\ndividual treatment, one to 20 needles may be used, de-\\npending on which meridian points are chosen.\\nAcupuncture needles are always sterilized and\\nacupuncture is a very safe procedure. The depth of inser-\\ntion of needles varies, depending on which chi channels\\nare being treated. Some points barely go beyond superfi-\\ncial layers of skin, while some acupuncture points re-\\nquire a depth of 1-3 in (2.5-7.5 cm) of needle. The nee-\\ndles generally do not cause pain. Patients sometimes re-\\nport pinching sensations and often pleasant sensations,\\nas the body experiences healing. Depending on the prob-\\nlem, the acupuncturist might spin or move the needles,\\nor even pass a slight electrical current through some of\\nthem. Moxibustion may be sometimes used, in which an\\nherbal mixture (moxa or mugwort) is either burned like\\nincense on the acupuncture point or on the end of the\\nneedle, which is believed to stimulate chi in a particular\\nway. Also, acupuncturists sometimes use cupping, dur-\\ning which small suction cups are placed on meridian\\npoints to stimulate them.\\nHow long the needles are inserted also varies. Some\\npatients only require a quick in and out insertion to clear\\nproblems and provide tonification (strengthening of\\nhealth), while some other conditions might require nee-\\ndles inserted up to an hour or more. The average visit to\\nan acupuncturist takes about 30 minutes. The number of\\nvisits to the acupuncturist varies as well, with some con-\\nditions improved in one or two sessions and others re-\\nquiring a series of six or more visits over the course of\\nweeks or months.\\nCosts for acupuncture can vary, depending on\\nwhether the practitioner is an MD. Initial visits with non-\\nMD acupuncturists can run from $50-$100, with follow-\\nup visits usually costing less. Insurance reimbursement\\nalso varies widely, depending on the company and state.\\nRegulations have been changing often. Some states au-\\nthorize Medicaid to cover acupuncture for certain condi-\\ntions, and some states have mandated that general cover-\\nage pay for acupuncture. Consumers should be aware of\\nthe provisions for acupuncture in their individual policies.\\nPrecautions\\nAcupuncture is generally a very safe procedure. If a\\npatient is in doubt about a medical condition, more than\\none physician should be consulted. Also, a patient should\\nalways feel comfortable and confident that their\\nacupuncturist is knowledgable and properly trained.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nMainstream medicine has been slow to accept\\nacupuncture; although more MDs are using the technique,\\nthe American Medical Association does not recognize it as\\na specialty. The reason for this is that the mechanism of\\nacupuncture is difficult to scientifically understand or\\nmeasure, such as the invisible energy of chi in the body.\\nWestern medicine, admitting that acupuncture works in\\nmany cases, has theorized that the energy meridians are\\nactually part of the nervous system and that acupuncture\\nrelieves pain by releasing endorphins, or natural pain\\nkillers, into the bloodstream. Despite the ambiguity in the\\nbiochemistry involved, acupuncture continues to show ef-\\nfectiveness in clinical tests, from reducing pain to alleviat-\\ning the symptoms of chronic illnesses, and research in\\nacupuncture is currently growing. The Office of Alterna-\\ntive Medicine of the National Institute of Health is cur-\\nrently funding research in the use of acupuncture for treat-\\ning depressionand attention-deficit disorder.\\nTraining & certification\\nMedical acupuncture has evolved in America which\\nuses traditional methods mainly as surgical techniques\\nand pain management, and not as part of Chinese medi-\\ncine overall.

The body manufactures it, and it is found\\nin most tissues of the body. Ademetionine is essential for\\nthe formation of glutathione, a water-soluble peptide that\\nhelps the body fight free radicals. SAMe also helps the\\nliver to process fats (protecting against a fatty liver) and is\\nbelieved to play a role in protecting the body from heart\\ndisease. SAMe is a methyl donor, which means that it\\nprovides other molecules with methyl groups that are\\ncritical to their metabolism. In general, ademetionine\\nraises the level of functioning of other amino acids in the\\nbody. Severe deficiencies of SAMe can cause problems\\nwith other important body functions, such as secretion of\\nimportant hormones like melatonin , which plays a key\\nrole in regulating sleep and circadian rhythms.\\nGeneral use\\nThe synthetic formula of ademetionine has been\\nhailed as an anti-aging formula because it is such a power-\\nful antioxidant. Antioxidants are substances that counter-\\nact the damaging effects of free radicals in human tissue.\\nAdemetionine has been widely popularized recently, but it\\nis not a recent discovery. In fact it was discovered in Italy\\nin 1952, and has been widely researched over the past few\\ndecades.

Ademe-\\ntionine became a useful treatment only during the 1990s,\\nhowever, when scientists found a way to stabilize it for re-\\nsearch purposes. After that technological development,\\nademetionine could be sold as a medical supplement.\\nAdemetionine has been used successfully to treat de-\\npression, arthritis, schizophrenia, liver disease, periph-\\neral neuropathy, and other illnesses. Many people who\\nhave these illnesses, particularly schizophrenia, peripher-\\nal neuropathy, and myelopathy, may have low blood lev-\\nels of folic acid , vitamin B 12, and certain amino acids,\\nparticularly SAMe and those with which it interacts.\\nPain relief\\nThe effectiveness of ademetionine has been studied\\nin clinical trials with human subjects. One six-week study\\ncompared SAMe to transcutaneous electrical nerve stim-\\nulation (TENS), which is a popular form of pain relief in\\nEurope. SAMe proved to be a more effective treatment.\\nLiver function\\nSAMe has been found to restore normal liver func-\\ntion in patients suffering from a variety of liver disease,\\nboth alcohol induced and other. It has also been found to\\nreverse liver damage resulting from the ingestion of vari-\\nous drugs and chemical agents (paracetamol and others).\\nDepression\\nSeveral clinical trials found that ademetionine has a\\nrapid effect on depression. Within double blind trials,\\nademetionine was found to have a markedly greater ef-\\nfect than placebos, with only mild side effects. Although\\nthe substance seems to work surprisingly well on most\\nforms of depression, a study done at Northwick Park\\nHospital in Harrow, England, suggests that it is more ef-\\nfective for endogenous depression (depression that does\\nnot have an obvious external cause) than for neurotic de-\\npression (depression that has an identifiable cause).\\nThese findings may be related to the fact that pa-\\ntients suffering from endogenous forms of depression are\\noften found to have low levels of this amino acid. This is\\na particularly exciting discovery, because endogenous\\ndepression is the most difficult form to treat. Ademetion-\\nine was found to be particularly helpful to post-\\nmenopausal women suffering from depression. Some\\npractitioners are suggesting the use of ademetionine in\\nconjunction with other antidepressants to shorten the pe-\\nriod between the beginning of antidepressant treatment\\nand the patient’s sense of improvement. Since ademetio-\\nnine generally has fewer side effects than many antide-\\npressants, it may be preferable to use it alone.\\nPeripheral neuropathy\\nAdemetionine has been used successfully to treat\\ncases of peripheral neuropathy that had not previously\\nresponded to treatment with vitamin B12 (cyanocobal-\\namin). This is an important discovery, because peripheral\\nneuropathy is difficult to treat.\\nMigraine\\nAdemetionine has been found to be a useful\\npainkiller. Over the long term, it may work less rapidly\\nthan some other analgesics, but it does not have the high\\nincidence of gastrointestinal disturbance that results\\nfrom taking ibuprofen, for example. Ademetionine may\\nbe the answer for patients who also suffer from GI tract\\ndiseases and cannot safely take other analgesics.\\nFibromyalgia\\nFibromyalgia is characterized by persistent muscle\\npain and aching that has no apparent cause.

SAMe is also free of the hazard of potential addiction.\\nOne possible drawback to ademetionine treatment is\\nits cost. A month’s supply may cost between $60 and\\n$100. This is about the same as the cost of many antide-\\npressants, but ademetionine is less likely to be covered\\nby medical insurance.\\nSide effects\\nSAMe is not suitable for patients with bipolar disor-\\nder, as it may amplify the manic phase of the condition.\\nThe only side effects observed with SAMe in clini-\\ncal trials were mild gastrointestinal distress.\\nIn patients who are deficient in the B vitamins, no-\\ntably B6 and B12, there is a danger that SAMe may break\\ndown to form homocysteine, an amino acid that has been\\nlinked to heart disease and stroke. If the patient’s levels\\nof B vitamins are maintained, however, the body will be\\nable to convert the homocysteine back into methionine\\nand glutathione, and the use of SAMe will not increase\\nthe risk of heart disease.\\nInteractions\\nAdemetionine should not be used in conjunction\\nwith prescription medications for depression, as it in-\\ncreases their effects. It should also not be taken with\\nMAO inhibitors, as it may produce a toxic reaction.

Accommoda-\\ntion, or the adjustment of the eye for distance, is affect-\\ned, as well as pupillary dilation and contraction, the abil-\\nity of the eye’s iris to open or close in response to ambi-\\nent light. Adie’s pupil primarily affects women from 20\\nto 40 years of age. It is considered to be a benign condi-\\ntion with no known cure. When Deep Tendon Reflexes\\n(DTRs) of the legs—knee and ankle jerks—are also af-\\nfected, accompanied by symptoms including localized,\\ndiscreet areas of the skin that do not sweat, postural hy-\\npotension (low blood pressure related to sudden standing\\nor rising), and unsteady heart rhythms, the condition is\\nreferred to as Adie’s syndrome.\\nDescription\\nThe eyes are a complex anatomical and neurological\\nunit. The outer surface of each eye is protected by a\\ncornea—a normally clear cover that initiates the bending\\nof light rays into the eye. Beneath the cornea lies the col-\\norful iris, a membrane containing two muscles capable of\\ncontracting and dilating like the diaphragm of a camera\\nas it floats in the “aqueous humor.” Beneath the iris, the\\nlens, under the influence of the ciliary body, further bends\\nand directs the incoming light back to the retina, where it\\nis received and transferred through the optic nerve at the\\nback of the eye to the visual center of the brain (the visual\\ncortex) at the back of the head. From the visual cortex, in-\\nstruction based on whether the object of vision is near or\\nfar, and whether the surrounding light is bright or dim,\\ngoes back to the muscles of the eye—the ciliary body—\\nthrough the ciliary ganglion, and results in a re-shaping\\nof the lens (accommodation) and an opening or closing of\\nthe pupil (pupillary reaction), as needed, in order to focus\\nmore sharply. Under normal circumstances, brightness\\nand accommodation for near vision will result in contrac-\\nture of the ciliary body and the pupil, whereas darkness\\nand accommodation for distance normally results in a re-\\nlaxation of the ciliary body and dilation of the pupil. For\\na person with Adie’s pupil, however, nerve signals arriv-\\ning at the ciliary body of one eye are weaker than to the\\nother eye, believed to be a result of damage to or degener-\\nation of the ciliary ganglion or the ciliary body. The af-\\nfected eye muscle is unable to contract, dilate, or focus\\nwith the same strength and speed as the unaffected eye.\\nRelative to the opposite, unaffected eye, in normal day-\\nlight the pupil of the affected eye will be larger whereas,\\nin a quickly darkened room, the affected eye will be\\nsmaller. Furthermore, the nerve from the ciliary ganglion\\nto the ciliary body has 30 fibers dedicated to changing the\\nshape of the lens and only one fiber dedicated to dilating\\nthe iris. As a result, a person with Adie’s pupil is even less\\nable to dilate their pupil than to focus. Some research\\nsuggests that as the person ages, the ability to dilate grad-\\nually lessens to the point that the eye may have a smaller\\n(constricted) pupil almost all the time.\\nThe list of other names by which Adie’s Pupil is\\nknown includes: Adie’s Tonic Pupil; Tonic Pupil Syn-\\ndrome; Holmes-Adie Syndrome and Adie-Holmes Syn-\\ndrome; Psuedotabes, Papillotonic Psuedotabes, and\\nPsuedotabes pupillotonica; Kehrer-Adie Syndrome;\\nMarkus’ Syndrome; Weill’s Syndrome, Weill-Reys Syn-\\ndrome, and Weill-Reys-Adie Syndrome; Psuedo-Argyll\\nRobertson Pupil, Psuedo-Argyll Robertson Syndrome,\\nand Nonluetic Argyll-Robertson Pupil; Myotonic Pupil\\nand Myotonic Pupillary Reaction; Saenger’s Syndrome;\\nand, Constitutional areflexy-tridoplegia interna. These\\nmany names derive from the lengthy history of study of\\nthis condition, beginning in 1813, when James Ware, a\\nLondon ophthalmologist, or medical doctor specializing\\nin the eyes, described some of these symptoms. Dr. Adie\\nadded to an already long list of doctors who had studied\\nit, when in 1931 he described the condition as self-gen-\\nerating. It was first referred to as Adie’s syndrome in\\n1934 by the French neurologist, Jean-Alexandre Barré.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nSome external causes such as trauma or surgery to the\\neye, and some internal causes such as an unknown virus,\\nan inflammatory condition, or a familial tendency have\\nbeen suggested. In the case of trauma or surgery, it is be-\\nlieved that the damaged or cut nerve fails to regrow with all\\nfibers running in the same direction for proper reattach-\\nment to the ciliary body. The propensity to affect women\\nbetween 20 and 40 years of age more than men of all ages\\npromoted one doctor to speculate that it may be, or related\\nto, an autoimmune disorder, especially when the individual\\nlives a stressful lifestyle and other related family members\\nhave suffered neurological diseases or disorders. Caffeine,\\na high sugar diet, or an imbalance in essential fatty acids\\nthat are important in maintaining nerve health may also be\\nfactors, but no studies have been identified supporting this\\nhypothesis. Occasionally similar symptoms are seen in\\nsyphilitic persons; however, one source notes that as early\\nas 1914,syphilis was ruled out as the cause of this condi-\\ntion. This unusual pupillary reflex, also known as “tonic\\npupil,” because it is slow to change, may also be associated\\nwith diabetes,alcoholism, a herpes viral infection, or a\\ncranial arterial condition known as giant cell arteritis.\\nSymptoms, in addition to the slow-to-respond, differently\\nsized pupil of the affected eye, may include headache, as a\\nresult of the strain on the vision, a sensitivity to bright\\nlights, and loss of some reflexes, especially the knee-jerk.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis is made on the basis of a thorough history\\nand physical examination, followed by tests to rule out\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 23\\nAdie’s pupil\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 23'),\n",

A positive (hypersensitive) reaction to pilo-\\ncarpine drops, an alkaloid substance from the jaborandi\\ntree that causes the otherwise slow-to-constrict pupil to\\nconstrict intensely, is considered diagnostically additive.\\nTreatment\\nNo specific treatments were noted; however, treat-\\nments that strengthen or protect the nervous system\\nmight be helpful, treatments such as the B complex of\\nvitamins,antioxidants including Vitamins C and E,\\nalpha lipoic acid, and Superoxidedismutase (S.O.D.),\\nand dietary modifications of fat that have been found\\nhelpful in multiple sclerosis , another condition due to\\ndamage to nerve pathways affecting nerve transmission,\\nincluding intake of essential fatty acids and reduced in-\\ntake of trans-fatty acids and hydrogenated fats.

A 150 ft (46 m) tall member of the Rose family\\n(Rosacea), pygeum has been found to be useful in treat-\\ning prostate problems, particularly benign prostatic hy-\\npertrophy (BPH), a condition affecting many men.\\nThe tree’s bark contains an oil with many active in-\\ngredients; waxes, fatty acids, and other less familiar\\ncompounds. Pygeum’s principal biological activity is\\ntraced to a “phytosterol” compound known as beta-sitos-\\nterol. Phyto (plant) sterols are structurally similar to, but\\nmuch less efficiently absorbed from the diet than,cho-\\nlesterol. The biological strength of phytosterols, howev-\\ner, is similar to that of hormones; therefore, a very small\\namount seems sufficient to initiate a response. Pygeum’s\\nphytosterols are anti-inflammatory. Pygeum also reduces\\nedema(the swelling caused by an excess of fluids), re-\\nduces levels of the hormone prolactin, lowers and in-\\nhibits cholesterol activity within the prostate. Prolactin,\\nwhose levels are increased by drinking beer, stimulates\\ntestosterone uptake by the prostate, reportedly increasing\\nlevels of a metabolite responsible for prostatic cell in-\\ncreases, dihydrotestosterone (di-hydro-testosterone),\\n(DHT). Cholesterol is reported to increase the influence\\nof DHT. BPH imlies two prostate changes: increased\\nsize and increase tissue density. These changes cause\\nsymptoms of frequent urge to urinate small volumes, re-\\nduced prostatic secretions, reduced bladder emptying.\\nIncomplete bladder emptying increases risk of bladder\\ninfections, edema and inflammation, and possibly, pro-\\nstatic cancer. Blood sugar levels and immune function\\nhave also been found to improve.\\nIn summary, african pygeum’s medicinal actions in-\\nclude:\\n• anti-inflamation\\n• reducing edema of the prostate\\n• inhibit cellular increase\\n• improving the natural flow of prostatic secretions\\n• lowering cholesterol\\n• regulating insulin activity, thereby affecting blood\\nsugar levels\\n• regulating the immune system\\nAlthough pygeum’s use is relatively new to the\\nUnited States, it has been imported from Africa to Eu-\\nrope since the 1700s, and is still used today as a major\\ntreatment for BPH. Europeans learned of this plant’s\\nusefulness in treating what was then known as “old\\nman’s disease”. It continues to be a widely popular in\\nEurope as a remedy for BPH, especially in France where\\nthe use of African pygeum for BPH is reported to be\\nabout 80%.\\nGeneral use\\nPygeum is Primarily used to treat benign prostatic\\nhypertrophy or BPH, a condition which affects men as\\nearly as their 40s, but increasingly with age: 30% of fifty\\nyear olds; 50% of sixty year olds; and nearly 80% of\\nmen 70 and older. It has been found to be of use in the\\nrelated condition of chronic prostatitis, with and without\\nprostate related sexual dysfunction , and infertility due\\nto reduced prostatic secretions. Due to actions as an im-\\nmune system “up regulator” and anti-inflammatory,\\npygeum is also being studied for use with other treat-\\nments for hepatitis C and HIV .\\nAccording to one source, in a double blind placebo\\ncontrolled study involving 263 men on a dose of 100 mg\\nper day of African pygeum extract for 60 days, the fol-\\nlowing improvements versus controls were observed:\\n• 31% decrease in “nocturia,” or night-time frequency\\n• 24.5% decrease in “residual urine,” the amount of urine\\nleft in the bladder after urination\\n• 17.2% increase in urine flow\\n• 50% increase in overall relief and feeling of wellbeing.\\nTwo-thirds of the group using Pygeum reported\\nfeeling satisfaction. This was twice the improvement re-\\nported by the control group on placebo.\\nIn a study on chronic prostatitis, 60% of men with\\nurinary tract infections and nearly 80% of men without\\ninfections reported improvements using 100 mg of\\nPygeum extract for five to seven weeks. In the treatment\\nof sexual dysfunction due to chronic prostatitis, a dose of\\n200 mg for 60 days, with or without an antibiotic, pro-\\nduced improvements in urination and sexual function.\\nThe few small and relatively short clinical trials of\\npygeum in the treatment of Hepatitis C and HIV+ infec-\\ntions have been statistically significant; further trials are\\nunder way in South Africa.\\nPreparations\\nSince the 1960s, in Europe, the most commonly used\\nform is the standardized herbal extract. The process is\\nhighly technical and, for Pygeum, is designed to target\\nextraction of the active oils using a sequence of laborato-\\nry extraction procedures.

The widely\\nmodern use of the extract form of African pygeum in-\\nstead of the whole plant may derive from the discovery\\nthat the plant’s activity is primarily due to its alcohol sol-\\nuble phytosterols. A month’s supply in capsules at a daily\\ndosage of 100 mg, standardized to contain approximately\\n14% of the active beta-sitosterol ingredient, costs be-\\ntween $40 and $50. In some preparations, synergistic in-\\ngredients such as amino acids, other herbs, and vitamins\\nor minerals, may be included. Studies cited used dosages\\nof 100 mg daily; however, one study compared and found\\ntwo dosages of 50 mg versus one dose of 100 mg per day\\nhad the same therapeutic effect.\\nPrecautions\\nPrecautions noted include recommendations to seek\\nthe guidance of a healthcare professional, and not to self\\ntreat. Pygeum may cause a hormonal shift, and is not rec-\\nommended for children. Also noted: pygeum may require\\nseveral weeks to months to make a noticeable difference;\\nstudies noted reported benefits at ranges of five to eight\\nweeks. One source reported pygeum relieves symptoms\\nbut does not reduce prostatic size. Another study specifi-\\ncally stated that the active components of pygeum have\\nsymptom reversal and prevention characteristics.\\nSide effects\\nPygeum appears to be relatively safe and non-toxic.\\nOne report noted rare occurrences of diarrhea, dizziness,\\ndisturbed vision, gastric pain and constipation.

In animal studies it\\nwas reported that dogs and rats given amounts equivalent\\nto more than 500 times the therapeutic dose showed no\\nadverse effects, and amounts equivalent to 50 times the\\ntherapeutic dose had no effect on fertility. In vivo and in\\nvitro studies showed no carcinogenic effects, In fact,\\npygeum’s constituents have been found to be anti-carcino-\\ngenic. The National Institute of Health (NIH), in 2002, es-\\ntablished a grant for a randomized controlled clinical\\nstudy involving 3,100 men, in order to learn more about\\nthe medical potential of this alternative therapy, due to in-\\ncreased BPH diagnoses as the population ages.\\nInteractions\\nSynergistic supplements may facilitate benefits.

Different species are used in several native cul-\\ntures for healing. The best know of these is Agastache\\nrugosa, also called the giant hyssop, wrinkled giant hys-\\nsop, Korean mint, or in Chinese Huo xiang.\\nAgastache rugosa is a perennial or biennial plant that\\ngrows to a height of 4 ft (1.2 m). It is native to China, but\\nhas spread to Japan, Korea, Laos, and Russia. It grows\\nwild on sunny hillsides and along roads, but also can be\\ncultivated in backyard gardens. The highly aromatic\\nleaves and purple or red flowers are used for healing.\\nSeveral other species of agastache found in other\\nparts of the world are used in healing. These include A.\\nnepetoides (yellow giant hyssop), A. foeniculum (anise\\nhyssop), and A. mexicana . Leaf and flower color vary\\nconsiderably among the different species. Many species\\nof agastache also are grown commercially in the United\\nStates for landscaping. In southern China and Taiwan,\\nPogostemon cablin, a relative of Pogostemon patchouli,\\nthe Indian plant that produces patchouli oil, is used inter-\\nchangeably with A. rugosa.\\nGeneral use\\nA. rugosa is used extensively in Chinese herbalism.\\nIt’s first recorded use dates from about 500 A.D. It is asso-\\nciated with the lungs, spleen, and stomach and is classi-\\nfied as having a warm nature and an acrid and aromatic\\ntaste. Traditionally, agastache has been associated the\\ntreatment of several different sets of symptoms. It has\\nlong been used to treat stomach flu, stomachache,nau-\\nsea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal bloating, and ab-\\ndominal pain. It is combined with Scutellaria (skullcap)\\nto treat morning sickness in pregnant women. It is also a\\ncomponent of formulas that improve digestive balance by\\naiding the absorption of nutrients and intestinal function.\\nIn Chinese herbalism, A. rugosa is also used to treat\\nsummer flu or summer colds with accompanying low\\nfever, feelings of fullness in the chest, and headache. It\\nis also used to treat dark urine and a feeling of heaviness\\nin the arms and legs.

There is a general decline in physical,\\nand possibly mental, functioning. In the Western coun-\\ntries, the length of life often extends into the 70s. Howev-\\ner, the upward limit of the life span can be as high as 120\\nyears. During the latter half of life, an individual is more\\nprone to problems with the various functions of the body,\\nand to a number of chronic or fatal diseases. The cardio-\\nvascular, digestive, excretory, nervous, reproductive, and\\nurinary systems are particularly affected. The most com-\\nmon diseases of aging include Alzheimer’s, arthritis,can-\\ncer, diabetes, depression, and heart disease.\\nDescription\\nHuman beings reach a peak of growth and develop-\\nment during their mid 20s. Aging is the normal transition\\ntime after that flurry of activity. Although there are quite\\na few age-related changes that tax the body, disability is\\nnot necessarily a part of aging. Health and lifestyle fac-\\ntors, together with the genetic makeup of the individual,\\ndetermine the response to these changes. Body functions\\nthat are most often affected by age include:\\n• Hearing, which declines especially in relation to the\\nhighest pitched tones.\\n• The proportion of fat to muscle, which may increase by\\nas much as 30%. Typically, the total padding of body\\nfat directly under the skin thins out and accumulates\\naround the stomach. The ability to excrete fats is im-\\npaired, and therefore the storage of fats increases, in-\\ncluding cholesterol and fat-soluble nutrients.\\n• The amount of water in the body, which decreases, re-\\nducing the body’s ability to absorb water-soluble nutri-\\nents. Also, there is less saliva and other lubricating fluids.\\n• Liver and kidney activities, which become less effi-\\ncient, thus affecting the elimination of wastes.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 228\\nAging KEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBiennial—Biennial plants take two years to com-\\nplete their life cycle and produce fruit and flowers\\nonly in the second year.\\nQi—Qi is the Chinese term for the vital life force\\nthat permeates the body.

There are changes in the im-\\nmune system as it begins to wear out, and the body is\\nmore prone to infections and tissue damage, which\\nmay ultimately cause death.

It was first recognized in the United\\nStates in 1981. AIDS is the advanced form of infection\\nwith the HIV virus, which may not cause disease for a\\nlong period after the initial exposure (latency). Infection\\nwith HIV weakens the immune system which makes in-\\nfected people susceptible to infection and cancer.\\nDescription\\nAIDS is considered one of the most devastating pub-\\nlic health problems in recent history. In 1996, the Centers\\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that\\none million persons in the United States were HIV-posi-\\ntive, and 223,000 are living with AIDS. Of these patients,\\n44% were gay or bisexual men, 26% are heterosexual in-\\ntravenous drug users, and 18% were women. In addition,\\napproximately 1,000-2,000 children are born each year\\nwith HIV infection. In 2002, the CDC reported 42,136\\nnew AIDS diagnoses in the United States, a 2.2% increase\\nfrom the previous year. AIDS cases rose among gay and\\nbisexual men (7.1% in 25 states that report regularly). The\\ndisease also seems to be rising among older Americans.\\nFrom 1990 to 2001, the number of cases in Americans age\\n50 years or older rose from 16,288 to 90,153.\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates\\nthat 40 million people worldwide were infected with\\nAIDS/HIV as of 2001. Most of these cases are in the de-\\nveloping countries of Asia and Africa. In 2003, WHO\\ncautioned that if treatment were not delivered soon to\\nnearly 6 million people with AIDS in developing coun-\\ntries, there could be 45 million cases by 2010.\\nRisk factors\\nAIDS can be transmitted in several ways. The risk\\nfactors for HIV transmission vary according to category:\\n• Sexual contact. Persons at greatest risk are those who\\ndo not practice safe sex, are not monogamous, partici-\\npate in anal intercourse, and have sex with a partner\\nwith symptoms of advanced HIV infection and/or\\nother sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). In the\\nUnited States and Europe, most cases of sexually\\ntransmitted HIV infection have resulted from homo-\\nsexual contact, whereas in Africa, the disease is\\nspread primarily through sexual intercourse among\\nheterosexuals.\\n• Transmission in pregnancy.

Reproduced by permission.)\\nAutoimmunity is a condition in which the body’s\\nimmune system produces antibodies that work against its\\nown cells. Antibodies are specific proteins produced in\\nresponse to exposure to a specific, usually foreign, pro-\\ntein or particle called an antigen. In this case, the body\\nproduces antibodies that bind to blood platelets that are\\nnecessary for proper blood clotting and tissue repair.\\nOnce bound, the antibodies mark the platelets for re-\\nmoval from the body, and they are filtered out by the\\nspleen. Some AIDS patients develop a disorder, called\\nimmune-related thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP), in\\nwhich the number of blood platelets drops to abnormally\\nlow levels.\\nThe course of AIDS generally progresses through\\nthree stages, although not all patients will follow this\\nprogression precisely:\\nAcute retroviral syndrome\\nAcute retroviral syndrome is a term used to describe\\na group of symptoms that can resemble mononucleosis\\nand that may be the first sign of HIV infection in 50-\\n70% of all patients and 45-90% of women. The symp-\\ntoms may include fever, fatigue , muscle aches, loss of\\nappetite, digestive disturbances, weight loss, skin\\nrashes, headache, and chronically swollen lymph nodes\\n(lymphadenopathy). Approximately 25-33% of patients\\nwill experience a form of meningitis during this phase,\\nin which the membranes that cover the brain and spinal\\ncord become inflamed. Acute retroviral syndrome devel-\\nops between one and six weeks after infection and lasts\\ntwo to four weeks, sometimes up to six weeks. Blood\\ntests during this period will indicate the presence of virus\\n(viremia) and the appearance of the viral p24 antigen in\\nthe blood.\\nLatency period\\nAfter the HIV virus enters a patient’s lymph nodes\\nduring the acute retroviral syndrome stage, the disease\\nbecomes latent for as many as 10 years or more before\\nsymptoms of advanced disease develop. During latency,\\nthe virus continues to replicate in the lymph nodes, where\\nit may cause one or more of the following conditions.\\nPERSISTENT GENERALIZED LYMPHADENOPATHY\\n(PGL). Persistent generalized lymphadenopathy, or PGL,\\nis a condition in which HIV continues to produce chronic\\npainless swellings in the lymph nodes during the latency\\nperiod. The lymph nodes most frequently affected by PGL\\nare those in the areas of the neck, jaw, groin, and armpits.\\nPGL affects between 50-70% of patients during latency.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL SYMPTOMS. Many patients will\\ndevelop low-grade fevers, chronic fatigue, and general\\nweakness. HIV also may cause a combination of food\\npositive mothers are at risk. As of 1997, it was estimated\\nthat 84% of HIV-positive women are of childbearing\\nage; 41% of them are drug abusers. Between 15-30% of\\nchildren born to HIV-positive women will be infected\\nwith the virus.\\nAIDS is one of the 10 leading causes of death in\\nchildren between one and four years of age worldwide.\\nThe interval between exposure to HIV and the develop-\\nment of AIDS is shorter in children than in adults. In-\\nfants infected with HIV have a 20-30% chance of devel-\\noping AIDS within a year and dying before age three. In\\nthe remainder, AIDS progresses more slowly; the aver-\\nage child patient survives to seven years of age. Some\\nsurvive into early adolescence.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBecause HIV destroys immune system cells, AIDS\\nis a disease that can affect any of the body’s major organ\\nsystems. HIV attacks the body through three disease\\nprocesses: immunodeficiency, autoimmunity, and ner-\\nvous system dysfunction.\\nImmunodeficiency describes the condition in which\\nthe body’s immune response is damaged, weakened, or\\nis not functioning properly. In AIDS, immunodeficiency\\nresults from the way that the virus binds to a protein\\ncalled CD4, which is found on certain white blood cells,\\nincluding helper T cells, macrophages, and monocytes.\\nOnce HIV attaches to an immune system cell, it can\\nreplicate within the cell and kill the cell. In addition to\\nkilling some lymphocytes directly, the AIDS virus dis-\\nrupts the functioning of other CD4 cells. Because the im-\\nmune system cells are destroyed, infections and cancers\\nthat take advantage of a person’s weakened immune sys-\\ntem (opportunistic) can develop.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 34'),\n",

At any time during the\\ncourse of HIV infection, patients may suffer from a\\nyeast infectionin the mouth called thrush, open sores or\\nulcers, or other infections of the mouth; diarrhea and\\nother gastrointestinal symptoms that cause malnutrition\\nand weight loss; diseases of the lungs and kidneys; and\\ndegeneration of the nerve fibers in the arms and legs.\\nHIV infection of the nervous system leads to general loss\\nof strength, loss of reflexes, and feelings of numbness or\\nburning sensations in the feet or lower legs.\\nLate-stage AIDS\\nLate-stage AIDS usually is marked by a sharp de-\\ncline in the number of CD4+ lymphocytes (a type of\\nwhite blood cell), followed by a rise in the frequency of\\nopportunistic infections and cancers. Doctors monitor\\nthe number and proportion of CD4+ lymphocytes in the\\npatient’s blood in order to assess the progression of the\\ndisease and the effectiveness of different medications.\\nAbout 10% of infected individuals never progress to this\\novert stage of the disease.\\nOPPORTUNISTIC INFECTIONS. Once the patient’s\\nCD4+ lymphocyte count falls below 200 cells/mm 3,h e\\nor she is at risk for opportunistic infections. The infec-\\ntious organisms may include:\\n• Fungi. Fungal infections include a yeast infection of\\nthe mouth (candidiasis or thrush) and cryptococcal\\nmeningitis.\\n• Protozoa. The most common parasitic disease associat-\\ned with AIDS is Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia\\n(PCP). About 70-80% of AIDS patients will have at\\nleast one episode of PCP prior to death. PCP is the im-\\nmediate cause of death in 15-20% of AIDS patients. It\\nis an important measure of a patient’s prognosis. Toxo-\\nplasmosis is another common infection in AIDS pa-\\ntients that is caused by a protozoan. Other diseases in\\nthis category include amebiasis and cryptosporidiosis.\\n• Mycobacteria. AIDS patients may develop tuberculo-\\nsis or MAC infections. MAC infections are caused by\\nMycobacterium avium-intracellulare , and occur in\\nabout 40% of AIDS patients.\\n• Bacteria. AIDS patients are likely to develop bacterial\\ninfections of the skin and digestive tract.\\n• Viruses. AIDS patients are highly vulnerable to cy-\\ntomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV),\\nvaricella zoster virus (VZV), and Epstein-Barr virus\\n(EBV) infections. Another virus, JC virus, causes pro-\\ngressive destruction of brain tissue in the brain stem,\\ncerebrum, and cerebellum (multifocal leukoen-\\ncephalopathy or PML), which is regarded as an AIDS-\\ndefining illness by the Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention.\\nAIDS DEMENTIA COMPLEX AND NEUROLOGIC COM-\\nPLICATIONS. AIDS dementia complex is a late complica-\\ntion of the disease. It is unclear whether it is caused by the\\ndirect effects of the virus on the brain or by intermediate\\ncauses. AIDS dementia complex is marked by loss of rea-\\nsoning ability, loss of memory, inability to concentrate,\\napathy and loss of initiative, and unsteadiness or weakness\\nin walking. Some patients also develop seizures.\\nMUSCULOSKELETAL COMPLICATIONS. Patients in\\nlate-stage AIDS may develop inflammations of the mus-\\ncles, particularly in the hip area, and may have arthritis-\\nlike pains in the joints.\\nORAL SYMPTOMS. Patients may develop a condition\\ncalled hairy leukoplakia of the tongue. This condition\\nalso is regarded by the CDC as an indicator of AIDS.\\nHairy leukoplakia is a white area of diseased tissue on\\nthe tongue that may be flat or slightly raised. It is caused\\nby the Epstein-Barr virus.\\nAIDS-RELATED CANCERS. Patients with late-stage\\nAIDS may develop Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), a skin tumor\\nthat primarily affects homosexual men. KS is the most\\ncommon AIDS-related malignancy. It is characterized by\\nreddish-purple blotches or patches (brownish in African-\\nAmericans) on the skin or in the mouth.

KS appears to be caused by a herpes virus.\\nThe second most common form of cancer in AIDS\\npatients is a tumor of the lymphatic system (lymphoma).\\nAIDS-related lymphomas often affect the central ner-\\nvous system and develop very aggressively.\\nInvasive cancer of the cervix is an important diag-\\nnostic marker of AIDS in women.\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause HIV infection produces such a wide range\\nof symptoms, the CDC has drawn up a list of 34 condi-\\ntions regarded as defining AIDS. The physician will use\\nthe CDC list to decide whether the patient falls into one\\nof these three groups:\\n• definitive diagnoses with or without laboratory evi-\\ndence of HIV infection\\n• definitive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of HIV\\ninfection\\n• presumptive diagnoses with laboratory evidence of\\nHIV infection\\nPhysical findings\\nAlmost all symptoms of AIDS can occur with other\\ndiseases. The general physical examination may range\\nfrom normal findings to symptoms that are closely asso-\\nciated with AIDS. These symptoms are hairy leukoplakia\\nof the tongue and Kaposi’s sarcoma. When the doctor\\nexamines the patient, he or she will look for the overall\\npattern of symptoms rather than any one finding.\\nLaboratory tests for HIV infection\\nBLOOD TESTS (SEROLOGY). The first blood test for\\nAIDS was developed in 1985. At present, patients who\\nare being tested for HIV infection usually are given an\\nenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for\\nthe presence of HIV antibody in their blood. Positive\\nELISA results then are tested with a Western blot or im-\\nmunofluorescence (IFA) assay for confirmation. The\\ncombination of the ELISA and Western blot tests is more\\nthan 99.9% accurate in detecting HIV infection within\\nfour to eight weeks following exposure. The polymerase\\nchain reaction (PCR) test can be used to detect the pres-\\nence of viral nucleic acids in the very small number of\\nHIV patients who have false-negative results on the\\nELISA and Western blot tests. In 2003, a one-step test\\nthat was quicker and cheaper was shown effective for de-\\ntecting HIV in the physician office setting. However, fur-\\nther research was ongoing as to its effectiveness in re-\\nplacing current tests as a first check for HIV .\\nOTHER LABORATORY TESTS. In addition to diagnos-\\ntic blood tests, there are other blood tests that are used to\\ntrack the course of AIDS. These include blood counts,\\nviral load tests, p24 antigen assays, and measurements of\\n/H92522-microglobulin (/H92522M).\\nDoctors will use a wide variety of tests to diagnose\\nthe presence of opportunistic infections, cancers, or\\nother disease conditions in AIDS patients. Tissue biop-\\nsies, samples of cerebrospinal fluid, and sophisticated\\nimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imag-\\ning (MRI) and computed tomography scans (CT) are\\nused to diagnose AIDS-related cancers, some oppor-\\ntunistic infections, damage to the central nervous sys-\\ntem, and wasting of the muscles. Urine and stool sam-\\nples are used to diagnose infections caused by parasites.\\nAIDS patients also are given blood tests for syphilis and\\nother sexually transmitted diseases.\\nDiagnosis in children\\nDiagnostic blood testing in children older than 18\\nmonths is similar to adult testing, with ELISA screening\\nconfirmed by Western blot. Younger infants can be diag-\\nnosed by direct culture of the HIV virus, PCR testing,\\nand p24 antigen testing.\\nIn terms of symptoms, children are less likely than\\nadults to have an early acute syndrome. They are, how-\\never, likely to have delayed growth, a history of frequent\\nillness, recurrent ear infections, a low blood cell count,\\nfailure to gain weight, and unexplained fevers. Children\\nwith AIDS are more likely to develop bacterial infec-\\ntions, inflammation of the lungs, and AIDS-related brain\\ndisorders than are HIV-positive adults.\\nTreatment\\nAIDS patients turn to alternative medicine when\\nconventional treatments are ineffective, and to supple-\\nment conventional treatment, reduce disease symptoms,\\ncounteract drug effects, and improve quality of life. Be-\\ncause alternative medicines may interact with conven-\\ntional medicines, it is important for the patient to inform\\nhis or her doctor of all treatments being used.\\nA report released in 2003 showed trends in in-\\ncreased use of alternative medicine among HIV-positive\\nindividuals. Based on 1997 figures, the study reported\\nthat 79% of those seeking alternative therapy to help\\nwith AIDS treatment or symptom relief were men and\\n63% were women. The types of therapies they used most\\nwere relaxation techniques, massage, chiropractic care,\\nself-help groups, commercial diets, and acupuncture.\\nSupplements\\n• Lauric oils (coconut oil) are used by the body to make\\nmonolaurin, which inactivates HIV .\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 236\\nAIDS\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 36'),\n",

AIDS pa-\\ntients took a tablet that contained 31 herbs that was\\nbased on the formulas Enhance and Clear Heat. Disease\\nsymptoms were reduced in the herbal treatment group as\\ncompared to the placebo group.\\nHerbals used in treating AIDS include:\\n• Maitake mushroom extract. Recommended dose is 10\\ndrops twice daily\\n• Licorice ( Glycyrrhiza glabra ) solid extract. Recom-\\nmended dose is one quarter to one half teaspoon twice\\ndaily\\n• Boxwood extract (SPV-30) has antiviral activity. Rec-\\nommended dose is one capsule thrice daily.\\n• Garlic concentrate (Allicin) helped reduce bowel\\nmovements, stabilized or increased body weight, or\\ncured Cryptosporidium parvum infection in affected\\nAIDS patients. However, a 2002 National Institutes of\\nHealth study cautioned that garlic supplements could\\nreduce levels of a protease inhibitor that is used to treat\\nAIDS patients, so patients should discuss using garlic\\nsupplements with their physicians.\\n• Tea tree oil (Malaleuca) improves or cures infection of\\nthe mouth by the yeast Candida . Tea tree oil is avail-\\nable as soap, dental floss, toothpick, and mouthwash.\\n• Marijuana is used to treat wasting.

The active ingredient delta-9-\\ntetrahydrocannabinol is licensed for treating AIDS\\nwasting.\\nPsychotherapy and stress reduction\\nMany therapies that are directed at improving men-\\ntal state can have a direct impact on disease severity and\\nquality of life. The effectiveness of many have been\\nproven in clinical studies. These include:\\n• massage\\n• laughter/humor\\n• stress management training\\n• visualization\\n• cognitive therapy\\n• aerobic exercise\\n• prayer\\nOther treatments for AIDS include homeopathy ,\\nnaturopathy, acupuncture, and chiropractic.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment for AIDS covers four categories:\\nAntiretroviral treatment\\nIn recent years researchers have developed drugs\\nthat suppress HIV replication. The drugs are used in\\ncombination with one another and fall into four classes:\\n• Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors.

Protease inhibitors are effective\\nagainst HIV strains that have developed resistance to\\nnucleoside analogues, and often are used in combina-\\ntion with them. These compounds include saquinavir\\n(Fortovase), ritonavir (Norvir), indinavir (Crixivan),\\namprenavir (Agenerase), lopinavir plus ritonavir (Rey-\\nataz), and nelfinavir (Viracept).\\n• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. This is\\na newer class of antiretroviral agents. Three are avail-\\nable, nevirapine (Viramune), efavirenz (Sustiva), and\\ndelavirdine (Rescriptor).\\n• Fusion inhibitors. These drugs are less common, ex-\\npensive and difficult to use. They block infection early\\nby preventing HIV from fusing with and entering a\\nhuman cell. This class includes only one compound:\\nEnfuvirtide (Fuzeon).\\nTreatment guidelines for these agents are in constant\\nchange as new medications are developed and intro-\\nduced. In mid-2003, the U.S. Department of Health and\\nHuman Services revised its guidelines for the use of\\nthese agents to help clinicians better choose the best\\ncombinations. The new guidelines offer a list of suggest-\\ned combination regimens classified as either “preferred”\\nor “alternative”.\\nTreatment of opportunistic infections\\nand malignancies\\nMost AIDS patients require complex long-term\\ntreatment with medications for infectious diseases. This\\ntreatment often is complicated by the development of re-\\nsistance in the disease organisms. AIDS-related malig-\\nnancies in the central nervous system usually are treated\\nwith radiation therapy. Cancers elsewhere in the body\\nare treated with chemotherapy.\\nProphylactic treatment for opportunistic infections\\nProphylactic treatment is treatment that is given to\\nprevent disease. AIDS patients with a history of Pneu-\\nmocystis pneumonia; with CD4+ counts below 200\\ncells/mm3 or 14% of lymphocytes; weight loss; or thrush\\nshould be given prophylactic medications. The three\\ndrugs given are trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, dap-\\nsone, or pentamidine in aerosol form.\\nSTIMULATION OF BLOOD CELL PRODUCTION. Be-\\ncause many patients with AIDS suffer from abnormally\\nlow levels of both red and white blood cells, they may be\\ngiven medications to stimulate blood cell production.\\nEpoetin alfa (erythropoietin) may be given to anemic pa-\\ntients. Patients with low white blood cell counts may be\\ngiven filgrastim or sargramostim.\\nTreatment in women\\nTreatment of pregnant women with HIV is particu-\\nlarly important because antiretroviral therapy has been\\nshown to reduce transmission to the infant by 65%.\\nExpected results\\nAt the present time, there is no cure for AIDS. Treat-\\nment stresses aggressive combination drug therapy when\\npossible. The use of multi-drug therapies has significant-\\nly reduced the number of U.S. deaths resulting from\\nAIDS. The potential exists to possibly prolong life indef-\\ninitely using these and other drug therapies to boost the\\nimmune system, keep the virus from replicating, and\\nward off opportunistic infections and malignancies.\\nPrognosis after the latency period depends on the\\npatient’s specific symptoms and the organ systems af-\\nfected by the disease. Patients with AIDS-related lym-\\nphomas of the central nervous system die within two to\\nthree months of diagnosis; those with systemic lym-\\nphomas may survive for eight to ten months. In America,\\nthe successful treatment of AIDS patients with HAART\\nhas actually led to a growing number of people living\\nwith HIV . About 25,000 infected people per year are\\nadded to the list of HIV-infected Americans.\\nHowever, not only does HAART and other treat-\\nment prolong AIDS patients’ lives, it has led to some im-\\nprovement in quality of life too. A recent study shows\\nthat HAART therapy substantially reduces risk of AIDS-\\nrelated pneumonia (PCP), although PCP still remains the\\nmost common AIDS-defining illness among opportunis-\\ntic infections. Other recent studies show that these pro-\\ntease inhibitors may result in high cholesterol and put\\nAIDS patients at eventual risk for heart disease. Further\\nresearch must be done, since long-term effects of\\nHAART treatment are just now being studied. Most clin-\\nicians would say the benefits outweigh the risks anyway.\\nPrevention\\nAs of 2000, there is no vaccine effective against\\nAIDS. Several vaccines to prevent initial HIV infection\\nand disease progression are being tested. In 2002, reports\\nshowed a new “library” vaccine showed potential. The\\nvaccine is composed of up to 32 HIV gene fragments\\nthat can induce a number of immune responses. In the\\nsame year, the British government worked with five\\nAfrican countries in a trial to find an effective gel that\\nwould protect women against HIV during sex.

In 2003, the first\\nhuman test of a vaccine against the most common sub-\\ntype of HIV was underway.\\nPrecautions to take to prevent the spread of AIDS\\ninclude:\\n• Monogamy and practicing safe sex. Besides avoiding\\nthe risk of HIV infection, condoms are successful in\\npreventing other sexually transmitted diseases and un-\\nwanted pregnancies.\\n• Avoiding needle sharing among intravenous drug users.\\n• Although blood and blood products are carefully moni-\\ntored, those individuals who are planning to undergo\\nmajor surgery may wish to donate blood ahead of time\\nto prevent a risk of infection from a blood transfusion.\\n• Healthcare professionals should wear gloves and masks\\nwhen handling body fluids and avoid needle-stick in-\\njuries.\\n• A person who suspects that he or she may have become\\ninfected should get tested. If treated aggressively and\\nearly, the development of AIDS can sometimes be post-\\nponed indefinitely.

Odle\\nAlcoholism\\nDefinition\\nAlcoholism is the layman’s term for alcohol depen-\\ndence and alcohol abuse. According to the Diagnostic and\\nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published by the\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association and commonly called the\\nDSM-IV , the essential feature of substance abuse (in this in-\\nstance, alcohol abuse) is maladaptive use of the substance\\nwith recurrent and significant adverse consequences related\\nto its repeated use. Dependence is a physical addiction with\\npsychological, social and genetic components. Despite\\ndamage to health, finances, reputations, and relationships,\\nthe alcohol dependent person will continue to drink unless\\nan intervention occurs. Abuse, distinguished from depen-\\ndence by retaining some control over the use of alcohol,\\nnevertheless carries many of the same consequences over\\ntime, and certainly increases risk of dependence.\\nToday, alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence are\\noften associated with abuse of, or dependence on, other\\nsubstances including nicotine,marijuana , cocaine,\\nheroin, amphetamines, sedatives, and anxiolytics (anti-\\nanxiety drugs). Alcoholism is more common in males\\nthan in females, with an estimated male-to-female ratio\\nas high as five-to-one. A United States study conducted\\nbetween 1990 and 1991, using DSM standards, found\\nthat 14% of the adult population (ages 15–54) had, at\\nsome time, met the criteria for alcohol dependence; and\\n7% had been alcohol-dependent in the past year. An ear-\\nlier, similar study showed that about 5% of Americans\\nqualified for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse at some point\\nduring their life. According to a 2002 report by the Na-\\ntional Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, 14\\nmillion Americans abuse alcohol, and 100,000 die annu-\\nally of alcohol related preventable causes. Though it is\\ndifficult to develop accurate statistics worldwide, it is\\nknown that the incidence of what we call alcoholism has\\nbeen steadily rising around the globe for several years.\\nDescription\\nThe effects of alcoholism are quite far-reaching. Al-\\ncoholism affects every body system, causing a wide\\nrange of drinking related health problems, including\\nlower testosterone, shrinking gonads, erectile dysfunc-\\ntion, interference with reproductive fertility, weak bones,\\nmemory disorders, difficulty with balance and walking,\\nliver disease (including cirrhosis and hepatitis ), high\\nblood pressure, weakness of muscles (including the\\nheart), disturbances of heart rhythm,anemia, clotting\\ndisorders, weak immunity to infections , inflammation\\nand irritation of the entire gastrointestinal system, acute\\nand chronic problems with the pancreas, low blood\\nsugar, high blood fat content, and poor nutrition.\\nIts mental health implications include marital and\\nother relationship difficulties, depression , unemploy-\\nment, poor performance at school or work, spouse and\\nchild abuse, and general family dysfunction. Alcoholism\\ncauses or contributes to a variety of severe social prob-\\nlems: homelessness, murder, suicide, injury, and violent\\ncrime. Alcohol is a contributing factor in 50% of all\\ndeaths from motor vehicle accidents. In fact, 50% of the\\n100,000 deaths that occur each year due to the effects of\\nalcohol are due to injuries of some sort. Alcohol costs\\nthe United States over $150 billion yearly in lost produc-\\ntivity and alcohol related medical expense.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nA physical dependence on alcohol develops insidi-\\nously, over time. The body is a magnificent adaptor;\\ntherefore, with persistent use, many adaptations occur\\nphysically and psychologically, resulting in both a higher\\ntolerance to and increased need for alcohol—craving it—\\nThe physical adaptation to alcohol involves changing lev-\\nels and altered balances of neurotransmitters, chemicals\\nin the brain which not only affect physical abilities like\\nmuscle coordination, but also mood. The abuse of alcohol\\nis associated with a desire to feel better and to avoid feel-\\ning poorly. Initially a stimulant, it eventually acts as a\\ncentral nervous system (CNS) depressant and is used in a\\nmajority of societies or cultures in the world as an accept-\\ned part of dealing with life events, except where religious\\nopposition bans, discourages or prohibits its use, as in\\nmost Muslim communities. It is included in celebrations\\nand, ironically, its use is perceived as an appropriate re-\\nsponse to sadness and loss, such as at wakes.\\nThere is, at this point, no single known factor that\\ncauses some people to be alcohol-dependent and others\\nnot. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated that close\\nbiological relatives of an alcoholic are four times more\\nlikely to become alcoholics themselves. Furthermore,\\nthis risk holds true even for children who were adopted\\naway from their biological families at birth and raised in\\nnon-alcoholic homes, without knowledge of their biolog-\\nical family’s difficulties with alcohol.

Further research may\\ndetermine if genetic factors are accountable, in part, for\\ndifferences in alcohol metabolism and increase the risk\\nof an individual becoming an alcoholic. Other cause re-\\nlated factors in alcoholism include high levels of stress\\nand turmoil or pain, having drinking friends, drinking\\npartners, and “enablers”—people who facilitate a\\ndrinkers habits and denial mechanisms. Heavy advertis-\\ning that makes drinking appear to be “sexy” or the basis\\nof a good time also contributes. Consider, for example,\\nthe number of televised sporting events that are spon-\\nsored heavily by alcohol related enterprises.\\nOne of the classic symptoms of alcoholism is denial\\nof a problem with alcohol. An addicted person, under the\\ninfluence of the addictive substance, is physically and\\npsychologically motivated to perpetuate the addiction.\\nTherefore, intervention often starts when loved ones,\\nrecognizing the signs and symptoms, bring attention to\\nthe problem and call for help. Occasionally, an interven-\\ntion requires a whole family unit and outside assistance.\\nSigns and symptoms of alcohol dependence and abuse\\nmay include the following:\\n• not remembering conversations or commitments\\n• losing interest in activities that were once pleasurable\\n• ritualized drinking, before, with, and after dinner and\\nbeing upset if the pattern is interrupted\\n• becoming irritable as “happy hour” approaches, espe-\\ncially if alcohol is not available\\n• drinking alone or secretly\\n• hiding alcohol in unusual places\\n• ordering doubles, drinking quickly, and drinking to be-\\ncome drunk, intentionally\\n• focusing attention on the source of one’s next drink\\n• unstable relationships, financial, legal, and employ-\\nment difficulties\\nPhysical symptoms of alcoholism can be broken\\ninto two major categories: symptoms of acute alcohol\\nuse and symptoms of long-term alcohol use.\\nImmediate (acute) effects of alcohol use\\nThough the initial reaction to alcohol may be stimu-\\nlatory, ultimately alcohol exerts a depressive, uninhibit-\\ning effect on the brain. The blood-brain barrier does not\\nprevent alcohol from entering the brain, so the brain al-\\ncohol level quickly becomes equivalent to the blood al-\\ncohol level. Alcohol’s depressive effects result in im-\\npaired thinking, feeling and judgment, short term memo-\\nry loss , muscle weakness difficulty walking, poor bal-\\nance, slurring of speech, and generally poor coordination\\n(accounting for the increased likelihood of injury and al-\\ncohol related injury statistics). At higher alcohol levels, a\\nperson’s breathing and heart rate slows. Vomiting may\\noccur, with a high risk of vomitus “aspiration” (inhaling\\nvomit into the lungs), and may result in further compli-\\ncations includingpneumonia. Still higher alcohol levels\\nmay result in coma and death.\\nEffects of long-term (chronic) alcoholism\\nAlcohol is considered a lethal poison, requiring con-\\ntinuous detoxification by the liver. As drinking contin-\\nues and overwhelms the liver’s ability to detoxify, long\\nterm consequences to health occur, affecting virtually\\nevery organ system of the body.\\nNERVOUS SYSTEM. It is estimated that 30–40% of\\nall men in their teens and twenties have experienced al-\\ncoholic blackout (loss of consciousness) as a result of\\ndrinking a large quantity of alcohol.

Two condi-\\ntions that may occur either together or separately are\\nWernicke’s and Korsakoff’s syndromes. Both are due to\\nthe depleted thiamin levels found in alcoholics. Wer-\\nnicke’s syndrome results in disordered eye movements,\\nvery poor balance, and difficulty walking, while Kor-\\nsakoff’s syndrome severely affects one’s memory, pre-\\nventing new learning from taking place.\\nGASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM. Alcohol causes a loos-\\nening of the muscular ring (the cardiac sphincter) that\\nprevents the stomach’s contents from reentering the\\nesophagus. As a result, acid from the stomach flows up-\\nward into the esophagus, burning those tissues and caus-\\ning pain and bleeding, or gastro-esophageal reflux dis-\\nease (GERD). Inflammation of the stomach can also re-\\nsult in bleeding (ulcers) and pain as well as a decreased\\ndesire to eat. A major cause of severe, uncontrollable\\nbleeding (hemorrhage) in an alcoholic is the develop-\\nment in the esophagus of enlarged (dilated) blood ves-\\nsels, which are called esophageal varices (varicose veins\\nof the esophagus). These varices actually develop in re-\\nsponse to the toxic effect of alcohol on the liver, and are\\nextremely prone to bursting and hemorrhage.\\nA malnourished state arises from the loss of appetite\\nfor food—due to caloric substitution of alcohol and its ef-\\nfects on blood sugar levels—and interference with the ab-\\nsorption of nutrients throughout the intestinal tract. Inflam-\\nmation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) is a serious and\\npainful problem in alcoholics that disrupts carbohydrate\\nand fat digestion, and increases the risk of insulin resis-\\ntance, weight gain, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and pancreat-\\nic cancer. Diarrheais also a common symptom of chronic\\nalcohol use, due to alcohol’s effect on the pancreas.\\nLIVER. Because alcohol is broken down (metabo-\\nlized) within the liver, that organ is severely affected by\\nconstant levels of alcohol. Alcohol interferes with the\\nlarge number of important chemical processes that occur\\nin the liver. As alcohol converts to blood sugar, which in\\nturn converts to blood fat, the liver begins to enlarge, fill-\\ning with fat, a condition called fatty liver. Cirrhosis, a\\npotentially deadly complication, develops when fibrous\\ntissue, while trying to support the extra burden placed on\\nthe liver by the accumulation of fat and liver cell weak-\\nness, interferes with the liver’s normal structure and\\nfunction. The liver may also become inflamed, a condi-\\ntion called hepatitis, producing jaundice , fatigue , and\\nelevated liver enzymes indicative of liver cell death and\\ndestruction. Because of the liver’s enormous role in di-\\ngestion, metabolism and immunity, damage to the liver\\ntakes a serious toll throughout the body.\\nBLOOD. Alcohol can cause changes to any of the\\ntypes of blood cells. Red blood cells become abnormally\\nlarge. White blood cells (important for fighting infec-\\ntions) decrease in number, resulting in a weakened im-\\nmune system. This places alcoholics at increased risk for\\ninfections and is thought to account in part for an alco-\\nholic’s increased risk of cancer (ten times greater than\\nnormal). Platelets and blood clotting factors are affected,\\ncausing an increased risk of bleeding and hemorrhage,\\nespecially when coupled with vascular weaknesses,\\nvarices, or aneurism.\\nHEART AND CIRCULATORY SYSTEM. Small amounts\\nof alcohol cause a drop in blood pressure, but increased\\nuse begins to raise blood pressure dangerously. Increased\\nblood pressure negatively affects the kidneys. While\\nsome studies demonstrate that one to two alcoholic\\ndrinks per night improves heart disease risk values,\\nhigher amounts and chronic intake produce high levels\\nof circulating fats, which increases the risk of heart dis-\\nease. Heavy drinking results in an enlarged heart, coro-\\nnary arterial disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease,\\nweakening of the heart muscle, abnormal heart rhythms,\\na risk of blood clots forming within the chambers of the\\nheart, and a greatly increased risk of stroke. Strokes re-\\nsult when a blood clot from the heart enters the circula-\\ntory system, goes to the brain, and blocks a blood vessel.\\nStroke may also result from a hemorrhage within the\\nbrain, as weakened vessel walls give way and platelet de-\\nficient blood pours through.\\nREPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. Heavy drinking has a neg-\\native effect on fertility in both men and women, decreas-\\ning testicular and ovarian size, interfering with sperm\\nand egg production and viability, disrupting menstrual\\ncycles, and reducing libido. When pregnancy is\\nachieved reduced quality of sperm and egg may signifi-\\ncantly and permanently affect the quality of life, pre-,\\nperi- and postnatally, of the child. A child born to an al-\\ncohol using woman has a great risk of being born with\\nfetal alcohol syndrome, which causes distinctive cranial\\nand facial defects, including a smaller head size, shorten-\\ning of the eyelids, and a lowered IQ. Developmental dis-\\nabilities, heart defects, and behavioral problems are also\\nmore likely.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe DSM-IV breaks substance abuse into specific\\ncriteria that can be of aid in diagnosing a substance\\nabuse problem. These criteria are paraphrased here to re-\\nlate to alcoholism. At least one of the following must\\nhave manifested itself within a 12-month period to quali-\\nfy for a diagnosis of alcohol abuse:\\n• Recurrent alcohol use that results in failure to fulfill\\nmajor role obligations at work, school, or home.

Specific examples are driving an auto-\\nmobile and operating a machine while impaired by al-\\ncohol use.\\n• Recurrent alcohol-related legal problems, such as ar-\\nrests for alcohol-related disorderly conduct.\\n• Continued alcohol use despite having persistent and re-\\ncurring social or interpersonal problems caused or ex-\\nacerbated by the effects of the alcohol. Examples in-\\nclude arguments with a spouse about the consequences\\nof intoxication, and alcohol-related physical fights.\\nA diagnosis of alcohol dependence requires habitu-\\nal, long-term tolerance for and heavy consumption of al-\\ncohol as well as the development of symptoms of with-\\ndrawal when the amount of alcohol in the system is sub-\\nstantially lowered or completely stopped. Once a pattern\\nof compulsive alcohol use has developed, alcohol-depen-\\ndent people may devote large portions of their time to\\nthe procurement and drinking of alcohol.\\nA significant number of illnesses categorized in\\nDSM-IV as alcohol-induced disorders has come into\\nbeing as a result of alcohol abuse and dependence, illus-\\ntrating the negative impacts of alcoholism on physical\\nand mental health. Among the psychiatric diagnoses that\\nare included in alcohol-induced disorders are:\\n• dementia\\n• amnestic disorder\\n• psychotic disorder\\n• mood disorder\\n• anxiety disorder\\n• sexual dysfunction\\n• sleep disorder\\nAs previously mentioned, due to the strong element\\nof denial and a need, usually, for an intervention, diagno-\\nsis is often brought about because family members call\\nan alcoholic’s difficulties to the attention of a physician.\\nA physician may become suspicious when a patient suf-\\nfers repeated injuries or begins to experience medical\\nproblems that are related to the use of alcohol. In fact,\\nsome estimates suggest that about 20% of a physician’s\\npatients are alcoholics, a percentage which is higher than\\nthe general population and lower than the increased risk\\nto health posed by alcoholism. In other words, alcohol\\nrelated illness may prompt an alcoholic to see medical\\ncounsel, but their illness may not be recognized as alco-\\nhol related until the disease toll is quite advanced.\\nQuestionnaires that try to determine what aspects of\\na person’s life may be affected by use of alcohol can be\\nan effective diagnostic aid. Determining the exact quan-\\ntity of alcohol that a person drinks is much less impor-\\ntant than determining how his or her drinking affects\\nhealth, relationships, jobs, educational goals, and family\\nlife. In fact, because the metabolism of alcohol (how the\\nbody breaks down and processes alcohol) is so individ-\\nual, the quantity of alcohol consumed is not part of the\\ncriteria list for diagnosing either alcohol dependence or\\nalcohol abuse.\\nOne very simple tool for beginning the diagnosis of\\nalcoholism is called the CAGE questionnaire. It consists\\nof four questions, with the first letter of each key word\\nspelling out the word CAGE:\\n• Have you ever tried to Cut down on your drinking?\\n• Have you ever been Annoyed by anyone’s comments\\nabout your drinking?\\n• Have you ever felt Guilty about your drinking?\\n• Do you ever need an Eye-opener (a morning drink of\\nalcohol) to start the day?\\nOther, longer lists of questions may help determine\\nthe severity and effects of a person’s alcohol use. A thor-\\nough physical examination may reveal the physical signs\\nsuggestive of alcoholism, such as an enlarged liver, a vis-\\nible network of enlarged veins just under the skin around\\nthe navel (called caput medusae) (or herniated umbili-\\ncus), fluid in the abdomen (ascites), yellowish tone to the\\nskin (jaundice), decreased testicular size or gynecomas-\\ntia (breast enlargement in men),osteoporosis , physical\\ndeterioration, loss of teeth, evidence of old injuries, and\\npoor nutritional status. Diagnostic testing may include\\ncardiovascular, CNS, GI, general chemistry and liver\\nfunction tests (LFTs) and reveal poor stress test perfor-\\nmance, arterial disease, congestive heart failure, palsy,\\nloss of coordination, reflux disease or history of stomach\\nulcer, irritable bowel syndrome,an increased red blood\\ncell size and anemia, abnormal white blood cells (cells\\nresponsible for fighting infection) counts or characteris-\\ntics, abnormal platelets (particles responsible for clot-\\nting), and increased liver enzymes. Given the genetic\\nrisk factors for alcoholism, determinations of familiar al-\\ncoholism related illness and death may be additive.\\nTreatment\\nAlternative treatments can be a helpful adjunct for\\nthe alcoholic patient once the medical danger of with-\\ndrawal has passed.

A list from the Mayo Clinic\\nalso includes acupuncture (may reduce craving, anxi-\\nety, depression, tremor, fatigue, and the symptoms of\\nwithdrawal),biofeedback (monitoring of internal systems\\nfor stress reduction),behavioral therapy motivational en-\\nhancement therapy (problem acknowledgment), and\\naversion therapy (may involve simultaneous use of med-\\nications the cause nausea or vomiting with relapse.)\\nNutritionally oriented practitioners may be consult-\\ned to address the malnutrition associated with long-term\\nalcohol use. Careful and remedial attention toward a\\nhealthier diet and lifestyle, including use of nutritional\\nsupplements, such as vitamins A, B complex, and C; cer-\\ntain fatty acids; amino acids; zinc; magnesium; and se-\\nlenium—supplements that support antioxidant, detoxify-\\ning, restorative and corrective deficiencies—may further\\nenhance recovery and lessen the likelihood of relapse.\\nHerbal treatments include milk thistle (Silybum\\nmarianum), which is thought to protect the liver against\\ndamage. Other herbs are thought to be helpful for the pa-\\ntient suffering through withdrawal. Some of these in-\\nclude the antidepressive attributes of lavender (Lavan-\\ndula officinalis), the calming and restorative nerve toni-\\nfying effects of skullcap (Scutellaria lateriflora ),\\nchamomile (Matricaria recutita ), and valerian (Valeri-\\nana officinalis), the stimulating and GI helpful effects of\\npeppermint (Mentha piperita ), and the bladder aid,\\nyarrow (Achillea millefolium).\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAllopathic treatment of alcoholism has two parts.\\nThe first phase is the treatment of acute effects of alco-\\nholism, called detoxification. The second phase involves\\nlearning how to live with the disease of alcoholism.\\nWithdrawal\\nDetoxification, or withdrawal, involves helping the\\nperson to rid his or her body of alcohol as well as the\\nharmful physical effects of the alcohol. Because the per-\\nson’s body has become accustomed to alcohol, he or she\\nneeds care and monitoring during withdrawal. With-\\ndrawal is an individual experience, depending on the\\nseverity of the alcoholism as measured by the quantity of\\nalcohol ingested daily and the length of time the patient\\nhas been drinking (the adaptation factor). Withdrawal\\nsymptoms can range from mild to life threatening. Mild\\nwithdrawal symptoms include nausea, ache, diarrhea,\\ndifficulty sleeping, excessive sweating, anxiety, and\\ntrembling. This phase may last from three to seven days.\\nMore severe effects of withdrawal may include halluci-\\nnations (in which a patient sees, hears, or feels some-\\nthing that is not real), seizures, an unbearable craving for\\nmore alcohol, confusion, fever, fast heart rate, high\\nblood pressure, and delirium (a fluctuating level of con-\\nsciousness). Patients at highest risk for the most severe\\nsymptoms of withdrawal (referred to as delirium tremens\\nor DTs) are those with other medical problems, such as\\nmalnutrition, liver disease, or Wernicke’s syndrome.\\nDelirium tremens usually begins about three to five days\\nafter the patient’s last drink and may last a number of\\ndays. Withdrawal usually progresses from the more mild\\nsymptoms to the more severe ones.\\nPatients going through only mild withdrawal, moni-\\ntored carefully to make sure that more severe symptoms\\ndo not develop, may not require medication, however,\\nfluids are encouraged to facilitate detoxifying the per-\\nson’s system. Patients suffering more severe effects of\\nwithdrawal may need to be given sedative medications,\\nbenzodiazepines like Valium or Librium, to relieve dis-\\ncomfort and to avoid the potentially life threatening\\ncomplications of high blood pressure, fast heart rate, and\\nseizures. Because of the patient’s nausea, fluids may\\nneed to be given intravenously (through a vein), along\\nwith some necessary sugars and salts (electrolyte push-\\nes). It is crucial that thiamin be included in the fluids, be-\\ncause thiamin is usually quite low in alcoholic patients,\\nand deficiency of thiamin is responsible for the Wer-\\nnicke-Korsakoff syndrome. In-patient treatment is usual-\\nly short-term (three to seven days), though longer reha-\\nbilitation programs lasting weeks or even months are\\nsometimes needed. Any treatment is usually followed by\\nlonger-term outpatient treatment.\\nRecovery\\nAfter the physical problems associated with alcohol\\nwithdrawal have been treated, the more difficult task be-\\ngins: helping the person to clearly recognize the nature\\nand severity of his or her illness. This is done on both an\\nin-patient and outpatient basis. Alcoholism is a disease\\nof denial; as members of Alcoholics Anonymous put it, it\\nis “the only disease that keeps telling you that you do not\\nhave a disease.” Recall that often the alcoholic is made\\naware of his or her condition through what is called an\\nintervention, a meeting with family and/or significant\\npeople who describe for the alcoholic the symptoms of\\nalcoholism that they have witnessed and how these\\nsymptoms have affected them. This is important because\\nalcoholics who are actively drinking are often not aware\\nof what they do, nor do they remember later what they\\nhave done. (Interventions are sometimes done before the\\nproblem becomes serious enough to require detoxifica-\\ntion from alcohol). Essential to recovery is the awareness\\nof powerlessness over the disease, acceptance of having\\nthe disease, and abstinence from the substance that per-\\npetuates the disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 45\\nAlcoholism\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 45'),\n",

The AA program is a twelve-step program.\\nIts steps involve recognizing the destructive power that\\nalcohol has held over the alcoholic’s life, looking to a\\nHigher Power for help in overcoming the problem, re-\\nflecting on the ways in which the use of alcohol has hurt\\nothers, and if possible, making amends to those people.\\nThe final step involves carrying the message of hope and\\nrecovery to other sick and suffering alcoholics. The\\nSerenity Prayer becomes an ally: “God grant me the\\nstrength to accept the things I cannot change, the\\ncourage to change the things I can change, and the wis-\\ndom to know the difference.”\\nThe best programs incorporate the alcoholic’s fami-\\nly or loved ones into the therapy, because loved ones\\nhave undoubtedly been severely affected by the drinking.\\nMany therapists believe that families, in an effort to deal\\nwith the alcoholic’s drinking problem, develop patterns\\nof behavior that unwittingly support or “enable” the pa-\\ntient’s drinking. This situation is referred to as co-depen-\\ndency. The twelve-step programs of Al Anon and Adult\\nChildren of Alcoholics are often very successful in help-\\ning the families or loved ones of alcoholics.\\nThere are also medications that may help an alco-\\nholic avoid returning to drinking. These have been used\\nwith variable success. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is a drug\\nwhich, when mixed with alcohol, causes a very unpleas-\\nant reaction that includes nausea and vomiting, diarrhea,\\nand trembling. Naltrexone (a drug that blocks a narcotic\\nhigh and may reduce the urge to drink) and acamprosate\\nseem to be helpful in limiting the effects of a relapse.\\nNaltrexone, found to produce liver damaging side ef-\\nfects, may be a difficultly exercised option. None of\\nthese medications has been found to be helpful unless\\nthe patient is also willing to work very hard to change\\nhis or her behavior.\\nExpected results\\nAs noted earlier, there is no cure for alcoholism. Re-\\ncovery from alcoholism is a lifelong process. In fact,\\npeople who have suffered from alcoholism are encour-\\naged to refer to themselves ever after as a recovering al-\\ncoholic, never a recovered alcoholic. Alcoholism can\\nonly be arrested—by abstaining from the drug, alcohol.\\nThe potential for relapse (returning to illness) is always\\nthere, and it must be acknowledged and respected. Sta-\\ntistics suggest that among middle-class alcoholics in sta-\\nble financial and family situations who have undergone\\ntreatment, 60% or more can successfully stop drinking\\nfor at least a year, and many for a lifetime.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention is primarily related to education and\\nearly intervention. In a culture where alcohol is so in-\\ngrained, education about the dangers of this drug is vital-\\nly important, even as early as early childhood. Since al-\\ncohol is the easiest and cheapest drug to obtain and the\\none most commonly used by teens, the first instance of\\nintoxication (drunkenness) with alcohol usually occurs\\nduring the teenage years. It is particularly important that\\nteenagers who are at high risk for alcoholism be made\\naware of this danger. Those at high risk include those\\nwith a family history of alcoholism, an early or frequent\\nuse of alcohol, a tendency to drink to drunkenness, alco-\\nhol use that interferes with schoolwork, a poor family\\nenvironment, or a history of domestic violence. Peers are\\noften the best people to provide this education, and\\ngroups such as SADD (Students Against Drunk Driving,\\na Marlborough, Massachusetts-based organization), ap-\\npear very effective. Courts and schools sometimes pro-\\nvide education through local substance abuse programs,\\nas well. Setting a good example, developing and practic-\\ning communication skills with your children, and frank\\ndiscussions about the consequences of drinking, are all\\nencouraged to prevent alcoholism related problems. De-\\nveloping alternative coping skills to life’s problems is\\nalso essential, as is encouraging a more distant perspec-\\ntive on the pervasive advertising that deceptively pro-\\nmotes alcohol’s health reducing glamour.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Excessive\\ntension, which Frederick Alexander, the originator, rec-\\nognized as both physical and mental, restricts movement\\nand creates pressure in the joints, the spine, the breathing\\nmechanism, and other organs. The goal of the technique\\nis to restore freedom and expression to the body and\\nclear thinking to the mind.\\nOrigins\\nFrederick Matthias Alexander was born in 1869 in\\nTasmania, Australia. He became an actor and Shake-\\nspearean reciter, and early in his career he began to suf-\\nfer from strain on his vocal chords. He sought medical\\nattention for chronic hoarseness, but after treatment with\\na recommended prescription and extensive periods of\\nrest, his problem persisted.\\nAlexander realized that his hoarseness began about\\nan hour into a dramatic performance and reasoned that it\\nwas something he did in the process of reciting that\\ncaused him to lose his voice. Returning to his medical\\ndoctor, Alexander told him of his observation. When the\\ndoctor admitted that he didn’t know what Alexander was\\ndoing to injure his vocal chords, Alexander decided to\\ntry and find out for himself.\\nThus began a decade of self-observation and discov-\\nery. Using as many as three mirrors to observe himself in\\nthe act of reciting, normal speaking, and later standing,\\nwalking, and sitting, Alexander managed to improve his\\ncoordination and to overcome his vocal problems. One\\nof his most startling discoveries was that in order to\\nchange the way he used his body he had to change the\\nway he was thinking, redirecting his thoughts in such a\\nway that he did not produce unnecessary tension when\\nhe attempted speech or movement. After making this dis-\\ncovery at the end of the nineteenth century, Alexander\\nbecame a pioneer in body-mind medicine.\\nAt first, performers and dancers sought guidance\\nfrom Alexander to overcome physical complaints and to\\nIanelli, Joseph. “When Alcoholism Hits Home.” American\\nJournal of Nursing (July 1997): 68+.\\nO’Brien, Charles P., and A.

Soon a great number of people sought help from\\nhis teaching for a variety of physical and mental disorders.\\nBenefits\\nBecause the Alexander technique helps students im-\\nprove overall functioning, both mental and physical, it\\noffers a wide range of benefits. Nikolaas Tinbergen, in\\nhis 1973 Nobel lecture, hailed the “striking improve-\\nments in such diverse things as high blood pressure,\\nbreathing, depth of sleep, overall cheerfulness and men-\\ntal alertness, resilience against outside pressures, and the\\nrefined skill of playing a musical instrument.” He went\\non to quote a list of other conditions helped by the\\nAlexander technique: “rheumatism, including various\\nforms of arthritis, then respiratory troubles, and even po-\\ntentially lethal asthma; following in their wake, circula-\\ntion defects, which may lead to high blood pressure and\\nalso to some dangerous heart conditions; gastrointestinal\\ndisorders of many types, various gynecological condi-\\ntions, sexual failures, migraines and depressive states.”\\nLiterature in the 1980s and 1990s went on to include\\nimprovements in back pain, chronic pain, postural prob-\\nlems, repetitive strain injury, benefits during pregnancy\\nand childbirth, help in applying physical therapy and reha-\\nbilitative exercises, improvements in strain caused by com-\\nputer use, improvements in the posture and performance of\\nschool children, and improvements in vocal and dramatic\\nperformance among the benefits offered by the technique.\\nDescription\\nThe Alexander technique is primarily taught one-on-\\none in private lessons. Introductory workshops or work-\\nshops for special applications of the technique (e.g.,work-\\nshops for musicians) are also common. Private lessons\\nrange from a half-hour to an hour in length, and are taught\\nin a series. The number of lessons varies according to the\\nseverity of the student’s difficulties with coordination or to\\nthe extent of the student’s interest in pursuing the improve-\\nments made possible by continued study. The cost of\\nlessons ranges from $40-80 per hour. Insurance coverage is\\nnot widely available, but discounts are available for partici-\\npants in some complementary care insurance plans. Pre-tax\\nFlexible Spending Accounts for health care cover Alexan-\\nder technique lessons if they are prescribed by a physician.\\nIn lessons teachers guide students through simple\\nmovements (while students are dressed in comfortable\\nclothing) and use their hands to help students identify\\nand stop destructive patterns of tension. Tensing arises\\nfrom mental processes as well as physical, so discus-\\nsions of personal reactions or behavior are likely to arise\\nin the course of a lesson.\\nThe technique helps students move with ease and\\nimproved coordination. At the beginning of a movement\\n(the lessons are a series of movements), most people pull\\nback their heads, raise their shoulders toward their ears,\\nover-arch their lower backs, tighten their legs, and other-\\nwise produce excessive tension in their bodies. Alexan-\\nder referred to this as misuse of the body.\\nAt any point in a movement, proper use can be es-\\ntablished. If the neck muscles are not over-tensed, the\\nhead will carry slightly forward of the spine, simply be-\\ncause it is heavier in the front. When the head is out of\\nbalance in the forward direction, it sets off a series of\\nstretch reflexes in the extensor muscles of the back. It is\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 248\\nAlexander technique\\nFrederick Matthias (F.M.) Alexander was born in\\nAustralia where he began a career as a young actor.\\nWhile leading the theater life, he developed chronic\\nlaryngitis. While tragic for a stage career, his lingering\\nailment would lead to his discovery of the Alexander\\nTechnique, which would ultimately help people around\\nthe world rid their bodies of tension and stress.\\nAt the age of 19, Alexander became frustrated with\\na medical practitioner’s inability to treat his hoarseness\\nand was determined to find the cause of his malady. Al-\\nthough lacking any medical training, Alexander began\\nto meticulously observe his manner of coordination\\nwhile speaking and reciting with the use of strategically\\nplaced mirrors. After following this method of study for\\n10 years, Alexander concluded that modern society was\\ncausing individuals to severely misuse the human sys-\\ntem of locomotion, thus resulting in the dysfunction of\\nother systems of the body. His experiments and tech-\\nnique laid the groundwork in the early 1900s for good\\nhabits of coordination or the proper use of the neuro-\\nmuscular system.\\nAlexander left Australia for London in 1904. The\\npopularity of the Alexander Technique led him to work\\nwith intellectuals such as George Bernard Shaw and Al-\\ndous Huxley. Alexander also taught extensively\\nthroughout the United States.\\nAs of 1995, The Alexander Technique is taught in\\n26 countries, and there are nine affiliated societies\\noverseeing a profession of approximately 2,000 teach-\\ners of the technique. Alexander’s technique continues to\\nhave a profound impact on the training of musicians,\\nactors, and dancers from around the world.\\nBeth A.

People,\\nespecially adults, have very strong tension habits associ-\\nated with movement. Chronic misuse of the muscles is\\ncommon. It may be caused by slouching in front of tele-\\nvisions or video monitors, too much sitting or driving and\\ntoo little walking, or by tension associated with past trau-\\nmas and injuries. Stiffening the neck after a whiplash in-\\njury or favoring a broken or sprained leg long after it has\\nhealed are examples of habitual tension caused by injury.\\nThe first thing a teacher of the Alexander technique\\ndoes is to increase a student’s sensory awareness of this\\nexcessive habitual tension, particularly that in the neck\\nand spine. Next the student is taught to inhibit the ten-\\nsion. If the student prepares to sit down, for example, he\\nwill tense his muscles in his habitual way. If he is asked\\nto put aside the intention to sit and instead to free his\\nneck and allow less constriction in his muscles, he can\\nbegin to change his tense habitual response to sitting.\\nBy leaving the head resting on the spine in its natural\\nfree balance, by keeping eyes open and focused, not held\\nin a tense stare, by allowing the shoulders to release, the\\nknees to unlock and the back to lengthen and widen, a\\nstudent greatly reduces strain. In Alexander lessons stu-\\ndents learn to direct themselves this way in activity and\\nbecome skilled in fluid, coordinated movement.\\nPrecautions\\nSide effects\\nThe focus of the Alexander technique is educational.\\nTeachers use their hands simply to gently guide students\\nin movement. Therefore, both contraindications and po-\\ntential physiological side effects are kept to a minimum.\\nNo forceful treatment of soft tissue or bony structure is\\nattempted, so damage to tissues, even in the case of er-\\nrors in teaching, is unlikely.\\nAs students’ sensory awareness develops in the course\\nof Alexander lessons, they become more acutely aware of\\nchronic tension patterns. As students learn to release exces-\\nsive tension in their muscles and to sustain this release in\\ndaily activity, they may experience tightness or soreness in\\nthe connective tissue. This is caused by the connective tis-\\nsue adapting to the lengthened and released muscles and\\nthe expanded range of movement in the joints.\\nOccasionally students may get light-headed during a\\nlesson as contracted muscles release and effect the circu-\\nlatory or respiratory functioning.\\nForceful contraction of muscles and rigid postures\\noften indicate suppression of emotion. As muscles re-\\nlease during or after an Alexander lesson, students may\\nexperience strong surges of emotion or sudden changes\\nin mood. In some cases, somatic memories surface,\\nbringing to consciousness past injury or trauma. This can\\ncause extreme anxiety, and referrals may be made by the\\nteacher for counseling.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nAlexander became well known among the intellectual,\\nartistic, and medical communities in London, England dur-\\ning the first half of the twentieth century. Among Alexan-\\nder’s supporters were John Dewey, Aldous Huxley, Bernard\\nShaw, and renowned scientists Raymond Dart, G.E.\\nCoghill, Charles Sherrington, and Nikolaas Tinbergen.\\nResearchers continue to study the effects and appli-\\ncations of the technique in the fields of education, pre-\\nventive medicine, and rehabilitation. The Alexander\\ntechnique has proven an effective treatment for reducing\\nstress, for improving posture and performance in school-\\nchildren, for relieving chronic pain, and for improving\\npsychological functioning. The technique has been\\nfound to be as effective as beta-blocker medications in\\ncontrolling stress responses in professional musicians, to\\nenhance respiratory function in normal adults, and to\\nmediate the effects of scoliosis in adolescents and adults.\\nTraining & certification\\nBefore his death in 1955, F.M. Alexander formed\\nthe Society for Teachers of the Alexander Technique\\n(STAT) in London, England. The Society is responsible\\nfor upholding the standards for teachers of the technique.\\nIn the late 1980s, due to rapid growth of the Alexander\\nteaching profession, STAT authorized replication of its\\ncertification body in many countries worldwide.\\nThe American Society for the Alexander Technique\\n(AmSAT) oversees the profession in the United States.\\nTeachers are board certified according STAT standards.\\nThey must receive 1600 hours of training over three\\nyears at an AmSAT approved training program.

There are many\\nsubspecies. It is a perennial plant growing up to 30 in\\n(0.75 m) in height in a wide range of soil condition. Its\\nsmall flowers range from yellow to purple. Alfalfa is\\nprobably native to the area around the Mediterranean\\nSea, but it is extensively cultivated as fodder for live-\\nstock in all temperate climates.\\nAlfalfa is a member of the legume family. It has the\\nability to make nutrients available to other plants both\\nthrough its very long, deep (6–16 ft [2–5 m]) root sys-\\ntem, and because it has a hosts beneficial nitrogen-fixing\\nbacteria. For these reasons it is often grown as a soil im-\\nprover or “green manure.” The medicinal parts of alfalfa\\nare the whole plant and the seeds. It is used both in West-\\nern and traditional Chinese medicine . In Chinese it is\\ncalled zi mu . Other names for alfalfa include buffalo\\ngrass, buffalo herb, Chilean clover, purple medick, pur-\\nple medicle, and lucerne.\\nGeneral use\\nAlfalfa has been used for thousands of years in many\\nparts of the world, as a source of food for people and live-\\nstock and as a medicinal herb. It is probably more useful\\nas a source of easily accessible nutrients than as a medici-\\nnal herb. Alfalfa is an excellent source of most vitamins,\\nincluding vitamins A, D, E, and K. Vitamin K is critical\\nin blood clotting, so alfalfa may have some use in im-\\nproving clotting. It also contains trace minerals such as\\ncalcium, magnesium , iron, phosphorous, and potassi-\\num. Alfalfa is also higher in protein than many other\\nplant foods. This abundance of nutrients has made alfalfa\\na popular tonic for convalescents when brewed into tea.\\nIn addition to using the seeds and leaves as food, al-\\nfalfa has a long history of folk use in Europe as a diuretic\\nor “water pill.” It is also said that alfalfa can lower cho-\\nlesterol. Alfalfa is used as to treat arthritis, diabetes, di-\\ngestive problems, weight loss, ulcers, kidney and bladder\\nproblems, prostate conditions,asthma, and hay fever .\\nAlfalfa is also said to be estrogenic (estrogen-like).\\nAlfalfa is not native to the United States and did not\\narrive until around 1850. However, once introduced, it\\nspread rapidly and was adapted by Native Americans as\\na food source for both humans and animals. The seeds\\nwere often ground and used as a flour to make mush.\\nThe leaves were eaten as vegetable. The main medical\\nuse for alfalfa in the United States was as a nutritious tea\\nor tonic.\\nIn China, alfalfa, or zi mu , and a closely related\\nspecies tooth-bur clover, Medicago hispida or nan mu xu\\nhave been used since the sixth century. Alfalfa is a minor\\nherb in traditional Chinese medicine. It is considered to\\nbe bitter in taste and have a neutral nature. Traditional\\nChinese healers use alfalfa leaves to cleanse the digestive\\nsystem and to rid the bladder of stones.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 250\\nAlfalfa\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDirection—Bringing about the free balance of the\\nhead on the spine and the resulting release of the\\nerector muscles of the back and legs which estab-\\nlish improved coordination.\\nHabit—Referring to the particular set of physical\\nand mental tensions present in any individual.\\nInhibition —Referring to the moment in an Alex-\\nander lesson when the student refrains from be-\\nginning a movement in order to avoid tensing of\\nthe muscles.\\nSensory awareness—Bringing attention to the sen-\\nsations of tension and/or release in the muscles.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 50'),\n",

The medicinal part of the plant is the dried\\nroot of Alisma plantago-aquatica . Alisma is also called\\nmad-dog weed, water plantain , American water plan-\\ntain, or northern water plantain. It belongs to a different\\nspecies from the edible plantain or cooking banana of the\\nCaribbean or the plantain that produces psyllium seed.\\nThe Chinese name for alisma is ze xie.\\nAlisma is a perennial plant that grows aggressively\\nin shallow water and boggy spots in parts of Europe,\\nNorth America, and northern China. Its leaves take dif-\\nferent shapes depending on whether the leaves grow\\nabove or in the water. The plant rarely reaches a height\\nof more than 30 in (0.9 m). There are several subspecies\\nof Alisma plantago found throughout the world, but their\\nmedicinal uses are the same.\\nGeneral use\\nAlisma has been used for centuries in China. It is\\nalso used today in North America and Europe. In the cat-\\negories used by traditional Chinese medicine, which\\nclassifies herbs according to energy level (hot, warm,\\ncool, or cold) as well as taste, alisma is said to have a\\ncold nature and a sweet, bland taste. It is used primarily\\nto treat conditions of damp heat associated with the kid-\\nney, bladder, and urinary tract.\\nAlisma is a diuretic and is used to rid the body of\\nexcess water. It has mild and safe tonic qualities that es-\\npecially affect the kidney and bladder. It is often com-\\nbined with other herbs in general tonic formulas. It is\\nused to treat kidney stones, pelvic infections, nephritis,\\nand other urinary tract infections, as well as yellowish\\ndischarges from the vagina. Alisma is also believed to\\nhave an antibacterial action that helps control infection.\\nIn China, alisma is also used to help rid the body of\\nphlegm, to reduce feelings of abdominal bloating, and to\\ntreat diabetes. The herb is also widely used in Japan.\\nOutside of China, alisma leaves are sometimes used\\nmedicinally. They can be applied externally to bruises\\nand swellings, or taken internally to treat kidney and uri-\\nnary tract inflammations. The roots are also used for kid-\\nney and urinary tract disorders, as well as to lower blood\\npressure and to treat severe diarrhea . A minor homeo-\\npathic remedy can also be made from the root.\\nModern scientific research shows that alisma does\\nact as a mild diuretic. In several studies done in Japan,\\nalisma extracts were shown to reduce artificially induced\\nswelling in the paws of rats. Studies using human sub-\\njects have not been done, but test tube and animal studies\\ndo seem to indicate that there is a scientific basis for\\nsome of the traditional uses of alisma. There is also some\\nindication that alisma does have a mild antibacterial ef-\\nfect, but again, evidence in humans is anecdotal and by\\nobservation rather than by controlled trials.\\nPreparations\\nAlisma roots are harvested before the plant blooms\\nand is dried for future use. Fresh root is toxic. Heating or\\ndrying deactivates the poisonous compounds in the root.\\nIf the leaves are used, they must be boiled for a long time\\nbefore using. Fresh leaves are also poisonous.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 252\\nAlisma\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDiuretic —Any substance that increases the pro-\\nduction of urine.\\nEstrogenic —Having properties that mimic the\\nfunctions of the female hormone, estrogen.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 52'),\n",

It is estimated that 60 million Americans, or more\\nthan one in every five people, suffer from some form of\\nallergy, with similar proportions throughout much of the\\nrest of the world. Allergy is the single largest reason for\\nschool absence and is a major source of lost productivity\\nin the workplace.\\nAn allergy is a type of immune reaction. Normally,\\nthe immune system responds to foreign bodies, like\\npollen or bacteria, by producing specific proteins called\\nantibodies that are capable of binding to identifying mol-\\necules (antigens) on the foreign body. This reaction be-\\ntween antibody and antigen sets off a series of reactions\\ndesigned to protect the body from infection. Harmless,\\neveryday substances trigger this same series of reactions.\\nThis is the condition known as allergy, and the offending\\nsubstance is called an allergen.\\nAllergens enter the body through four main routes:\\nthe airways, the skin, the gastrointestinal tract, and the\\ncirculatory system.\\n• Airborne allergens cause the sneezing, runny nose, and\\nitchy, bloodshot eyes of hay fever (allergic rhinitis ).\\nAirborne allergens can also affect the lining of the\\nlungs, causing asthma, or the conjunctiva of the eyes,\\ncausing conjunctivitis (pink eye).\\n• Allergens in food can cause itching and swelling of the\\nlips and throat, cramps, and diarrhea. When absorbed\\ninto the bloodstream, they may cause hives or more se-\\nvere reactions involving recurrent, non-inflammatory\\nswelling of the skin, mucous membranes, organs, and\\nbrain (angioedema). Some food allergens may cause\\nanaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening condition\\nmarked by tissue swelling, airway constriction, and\\ndrop in blood pressure.\\n• In contact with the skin, allergens can cause reddening,\\nitching, and blistering, called contact dermatitis. Skin\\nreactions can also occur from allergens introduced\\nthrough the airways or gastrointestinal tract. This type\\nof reaction is known as atopic dermatitis.\\nAlisma is an ingredient in many common Chinese\\npreparations to improve kidney balance and general\\nhealth. These include rehmannia eight and rehmannia six\\ncombination, lycium chrysanthemum and rehmannia\\ncombination, rehmannia and schizandra, rehmannia and\\ncornus, rehmannia and magnetitum formula, immortal\\nlong life pill, gentiana, and hoeln five. An extract of al-\\nisma root is commercially available. Some herbalists in-\\ndicate that a large dose is necessary for alisma to be\\ncompletely effective when treating infections, or that it\\nshould be combined with other anti-infective herbs.\\nPrecautions\\nFresh alisma roots and leaves are poisonous. Dried\\nroots or cooked leaves are safe, even in fairly large doses.\\nHowever, the kidney infections that alisma is used to\\ntreat can be serious. Anyone who suspects that they have\\na kidney infection should see a medical practitioner.\\nSide effects\\nSome Chinese herbalists indicate that long-term use\\nof alisma can irritate the intestines.\\nInteractions\\nIn China and Japan, alisma is often taken together\\nwith antibiotics for kidney infections without any nega-\\ntive interactions. Since alisma is primarily an Asian herb,\\nthere is no body of information on how it might interact\\nwith most Western pharmaceuticals.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMolony, David.

In the gastrointesti-\\nnal tract, these reactions lead to swelling and irritation of\\nthe intestinal lining, which causes the cramping and diar-\\nrhea typical of food allergy. Allergens that enter the cir-\\nculation may cause hives, angioedema, anaphylaxis, or\\natopic dermatitis.\\nAllergens on the skin usually cause delayed hyper-\\nsensitivity reaction. Roving T cells contact the allergen,\\nsetting in motion a more prolonged immune response.\\nThis type of allergic response may develop over several\\ndays following contact with the allergen, and symptoms\\nmay persist for a week or more.\\nTHE ROLE OF INHERITANCE. While allergy to specif-\\nic allergens is not inherited, the likelihood of developing\\nsome type of allergy seems to be, at least for many peo-\\nple. If neither parent has allergies, the chances of a child\\ndeveloping allergy is approximately 10–20%; if one par-\\nent has allergies, it is 30–50%; and if both have allergies,\\nit is 40–75%.\\nCOMMON ALLERGENS. The most common airborne\\nallergens are the following:\\n• plant pollens\\n• animal fur and dander\\n• body parts from house mites (microscopic creatures\\nfound in all houses)\\n• house dust\\n• mold spores\\n• cigarette smoke\\n• solvents\\n• cleaners\\nCommon food allergens include the following:\\n• nuts, especially peanuts, walnuts, and Brazil nuts\\n• fish, mollusks, and shellfish\\n• eggs\\n• wheat\\n• milk\\n• food additives and preservatives\\nCommon causes of contact dermatitis include the\\nfollowing:\\n• poison ivy,oak, and sumac\\n• nickel or nickel alloys\\n• latex\\nInsects and other arthropods whose bites or stings\\ntypically cause allergy include the following:\\n• bees, wasps, and hornets\\n• mosquitoes\\n• fleas\\n• scabies\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms depend on the specific type of allergic re-\\naction. Allergic rhinitis is characterized by an itchy, runny\\nnose often with a scratchy or irritated throat due to post-\\nnasal drip. Inflammation of the thin membrane covering\\nthe eye (allergic conjunctivitis) causes redness, irritation\\nand increased tearing in the eyes. Asthma causes wheez-\\ning, coughing, and shortness of breath. Symptoms of\\nfood allergies depend on the tissues most sensitive to the\\nallergen and whether it is spread systemically by the cir-\\nculatory system. Gastrointestinal symptoms may include\\nswelling and tingling in the lips, tongue, palate or throat;\\nnausea; cramping; diarrhea; and gas. Contact dermatitis\\nis marked by reddened, itchy, weepy skin blisters.\\nWhole body or systemic reactions may occur from\\nany type of allergen, but are more common following in-\\ngestion or injection of an allergen. Skin reactions include\\nthe raised, reddened, and itchy patches called hives. A\\ndeeper and more extensive skin reaction, involving more\\nextensive fluid collection, is called angioedema. Ana-\\nphylaxis, another reaction, is marked by difficulty\\nbreathing, blood pressure drop, widespread tissue\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 55\\nAllergies\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 55'),\n",

Allergy tests can be used to\\nidentify potential allergens. These tests usually begin\\nwith prick tests or patch tests, which expose the skin to\\nsmall amounts of allergen to observe the response. Reac-\\ntion will occur on the skin even if the allergen is normal-\\nly encountered in food or in the airways. RAST testing is\\na blood test that measures the level of reactive antibodies\\nin the blood. Provocation tests, most commonly done\\nwith airborne allergens, present the allergen directly\\nthrough the route normally involved. Food allergen\\nprovocation tests require abstinence from the suspect al-\\nlergen for two weeks or more, followed by ingestion of a\\nmeasured amount. Provocation tests are not used if ana-\\nphylaxis is a concern due to the patient’s medical history.\\nTreatment\\nAllergic rhinitis\\nThe following can help to relieve the symptoms of\\nairborne allergies:\\n• Stinging nettle (Urtica dioica ) has antihistamine and\\nanti-inflammatory properties. The common dose is 300\\nmg four times daily.\\n• Grape (Vitis vinifera ) seed extract has antihistamine\\nand anti-inflammatory properties. The usual dose is 50\\nmg three times daily.\\n• Ephedra (Ephedra sinicia), also called ma huang, has\\nanti-inflammatory activity and is proven effective in treat-\\ning allergies. Taken as a tea thrice daily or 12.5–25 mg in\\ncapsule form. Ephedra should not be used for prolonged\\nperiods of time, as it can raise blood pressure, cause rapid\\nheartbeat, and interfere with adrenal gland function.\\n• Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) has cortisone-like activi-\\nty which is anti-inflammatory, stimulates the adrenals,\\nand relieves allergy symptoms. Can be taken as a tea or\\n100–300 mg in capsule form. Long term use can result\\nin sodium retention or potassium loss.\\n• Chinese skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis ) has bron-\\nchodilator activity, is an anti-inflammatory, and pre-\\nvents allergic reactions. It is taken in combination with\\nother herbs.\\n• Ginkgo ( Ginkgo biloba ) seeds are used in Chinese\\nmedicine for wheezing and coughing.\\n• Echinacea (Echinacea species) may have anti- inflam-\\nmatory activity and boost the immune system.\\n• Khellin (Ammi visnaga) has bronchodilator activity.\\n• Cramp (Viburnum opulus) bark has bronchodilator ac-\\ntivity.\\n• Traditional Chinese medicine treats allergic rhinitis\\nwith various species. Patent combination medicines\\nare: Bu Zhong Yi Qi Wan (Tonify the Middle and Aug-\\nment the Qi) and Yu Ping Feng San (Jade Windscreen)\\nare used for preventing allergies, and Bi Yan Pian\\n(Rhinitis Infusion) is often prescribed for syptoms af-\\nfecting the nose.\\n• The homeopathic remedies Rhus toxicodendron , Apis\\nmellifica, and Nux vomica have decongestant activities.\\nThey are taken internally.\\n• Vitamin Chas antihistamine and decongestant activities.\\n• Vitamins A and E are antioxidants and help to pro-\\nmote normal functioning of the immune system.\\n• Coenzyme Q10 may help to promote normal function-\\ning of the immune system.\\n• Zinc may boost the immune system.\\n• N-acetylcysteine may have decongestant activity.\\n• Acupuncture has been shown to be as effective as anti-\\nhistamine drugs in treating allergic rhinitis. It is also\\nused to help prevent allergic reactions by strengthening\\nthe immune system.\\nSkin reactions\\nA variety of herbal remedies, either applied topical-\\nly or taken internally, can assist in the treatment of con-\\ntact dermatitis. A poultice made of jewelweed (Impatiens\\nspecies) or chickweed (Stellaria media ) can soothe the\\nskin. A cream or wash containing calendula (Calendula\\nofficinalis ), a natural antiseptic and anti-inflammatory\\nagent, can help heal the rash. Chinese herbal remedies\\nhave been effective in treating atopic dermatitis. The fol-\\nlowing are homeopathic remedies to be taken internally:\\n• Apis (Apis mellifica) for hives that feel better with cold\\napplication and bee stings\\n• Poison ivy (Rhus toxicodendron) for hives that feel bet-\\nter with hot applications and for poison ivy, oak, or\\nsumac rashes\\n• Stinging nettle (Urtica urens) for hives\\n• Marsh tea (Ledum) for itching insect bites\\n• Croton ( Croton tiglium ) oil for poison ivy, oak, or\\nsumac rashes\\nFood allergies\\nFood allergy may be managed by oral desensitiza-\\ntion.

Oral desensitiza-\\ntion exposes the patient to allergens in controlled, but in-\\ncreasing, doses. Control subjects, who had avoided the\\nallergenic food during the study, were still sensitive.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA large number of prescription and over-the-counter\\ndrugs are available for treatment of immediate hypersen-\\nsitivity reactions. Most of these drugs work by decreas-\\ning the ability of histamine to provoke symptoms. Other\\ndrugs counteract the effects of histamine by stimulating\\nother systems or reducing immune responses in general.\\nANTIHISTAMINES. Antihistamines block the hista-\\nmine receptors on nasal tissue, decreasing the effect of\\nhistamine released by mast cells. They may be used after\\nsymptoms appear, though they seem to prove more ef-\\nfective when used preventively. A wide variety of anti-\\nhistamines are available.\\nDECONGESTANTS. Decongestants constrict blood\\nvessels to counteract the effects of histamine. Nasal\\nsprays and oral systemic preparations are available. De-\\ncongestants are stimulants and may cause increased\\nheart rate and blood pressure, headaches, and agitation.\\nUse of nasal sprays for longer than several days can\\ncause loss of effectiveness and rebound congestion, in\\nwhich nasal passages become more severely swollen\\nthan before treatment.\\nTOPICAL CORTICOSTEROIDS. Topical corticosteroids\\nreduce mucous membrane and skin inflammation and are\\navailable by prescription. Allergies tend to become worse\\nas the season progresses and topical corticosteroids are\\nespecially effective at reducing this seasonal sensitiza-\\ntion. As a result, they are best started before allergy sea-\\nson begins. A 2001 study revealed that steroid nasal\\nsprays work better for seasonal allergies on an as-needed\\nbasis than do antihistamines. Side effects are usually\\nmild, but may include headaches,nosebleeds , and un-\\npleasant taste sensations.\\nMAST CELL STABILIZERS. Cromolyn sodium prevents\\nthe release of mast cell granules, thereby preventing the\\nrelease of histamine and other chemicals contained in\\nthem. Cromolyn sodium is available as a nasal spray and\\naerosol (a suspension of particles in gas).\\nBRONCHODILATORS. Because allergic reactions in-\\nvolving the lungs cause the airways or bronchial tubes to\\nnarrow, bronchodilators, which cause the smooth muscle\\nlining the airways to open, can be very effective. Bron-\\nchodilators include adrenaline, albuterol, and theo-\\nphylline. Other drugs, including steroids, are used to pre-\\nvent and control asthma attacks.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy, also known as desensitization or al-\\nlergy shots, alters the balance of antibody types in the\\nbody. Injections involve gradually increasing amounts of\\nallergen, over several weeks or months, with periodic\\nboosters. Full benefits may take up to several years to\\nachieve and are not seen at all in about one in five pa-\\ntients. Individuals receiving all shots will be monitored\\nclosely following each shot because of the small risk of\\nanaphylaxis, a condition that can result in difficulty\\nbreathing and a sharp drop in blood pressure.\\nPossible future treatments\\nIn late 2001, a reports stated that a monoclonal anti-\\nbody called omalizumab might be effective in treating\\nseasonal allergies and preventing related asthma. By\\nblocking immunoglobulin E (IgE), an antibody that is\\nfound in excessive amounts in those with hay fever, the\\ndrug treats hay fever and helps prevent related asthma.\\nTrials on the drug continue, and other immune-based\\nmedicines will likely accompany its ultimate release.\\nTreatment of contact dermatitis\\nCalamine lotion applied to affected skin can reduce ir-\\nritation somewhat. Topical corticosteroid creams are more\\neffective, though overuse may lead to dry and scaly skin.\\nTreatment of anaphylaxis\\nThe emergency condition of anaphylaxis is treated\\nwith injection of adrenaline, also known as epinephrine.\\nPeople who are prone to anaphylaxis because of food or\\ninsect allergies often carry an “Epi-pen” containing\\nadrenaline in a hypodermic needle. Prompt injection can\\nprevent a more serious reaction from developing.\\nExpected results\\nAllergies can improve over time, although they\\noften worsen. While anaphylaxis and severe asthma are\\nlife-threatening, other allergic reactions are not. Learn-\\ning to recognize and avoid allergy-provoking situations\\nallows most people with allergies to lead normal lives.\\nPrevention\\nBy determining which allergens are causing the reac-\\ntions, most people can learn to avoid allergic reactions\\nfrom food, drugs, and contact allergens. Airborne aller-\\ngens are more difficult to avoid, although keeping dust\\nand animal dander from collecting in the house may limit\\nexposure. Vitamin C may prevent allergy symptoms. Cro-\\nmolyn sodium can be used for allergy prevention.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 57\\nAllergies\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 57'),\n",

There are about 300 identified species,\\nbut Aloe vera (“true aloe”) is the most popular for med-\\nical applications. It has also been known as Aloe vulgaris\\n(“common aloe”) and Aloe barbadensis . The plant has\\nyellow flowers and triangular, fleshy leaves with serrated\\nedges that arise from a central base and may grow to\\nnearly 2 ft (0.6 m) long. Each leaf is composed of three\\nlayers. A clear gel, that is the part of the plant used for\\ntopical application is contained within the cells of the\\ngenerous inner portion. Anthraquinones, which exert a\\nmarked laxative effect, are contained in the bitter yellow\\nsap of the middle leaf layer. The fibrous outer part of the\\nleaf serves a protective function.\\nHistory\\nAloe vera has been in use for thousands of years,\\nand is mentioned in records as long ago as 1750 B.C.\\nUse of the plant is thought to have originated in Egypt\\nor the Middle East. It was reputedly used in Egyptian\\nembalming procedures, as drawings of Aloe vera have\\nbeen found on cave walls in the region. Legend has it\\nthat Aloe vera was one of Cleopatra’s secrets for keep-\\ning her skin soft. Pliny and Dioscorides of ancient\\nGreece wrote of the healing effects of this plant. Addi-\\ntionally, Alexander the Great is said to have acquired\\nMadagascar so that he could utilize the Aloe vera grow-\\ning there to treat soldiers’ wounds . It is also a remedy\\nwhich has long been used in the Indian practice of\\nAyurvedic medicine.\\nIn the United States, Aloe vera was in use by the\\nearly 1800s, but primarily as a laxative. A turning point\\noccurred in the mid-1930s, when a woman with chronic\\nand severe dermatitis resulting from x-ray treatments\\nwas healed by an application of Aloe vera leaf gel. Suc-\\ncess with this patient encouraged trials with others suf-\\nfering from radiation burns. Evidence of the effective-\\nness remained anecdotal until 1953, when Lushbaugh\\nand Hale produced a convincing study, using Aloe vera\\nto treat beta radiation lesions in rats. Other experimental\\nprotocols have been carried out using animals since that\\ntime, but there is little human research data to describe\\nthe degree of effectiveness of Aloe vera treatment. Some\\nevidence suggests that it is especially helpful in the el-\\nderly and other people with impaired health or failing\\nimmune systems.\\nBiologic components\\nAloe vera contains a wealth of substances that are\\nbiologically active. The laxative, and in large doses,\\npurgative, effects of Aloe vera latex are attributable to a\\ngroup of chemicals known as the anthraquinones. Aloin,\\nbarbaloin, and aloe-emodin, and aloectic acid, are a few\\nof the anthraquinones contained in the latex layer. The\\nlatest, and perhaps most exciting component discovered\\nin Aloe vera is a biologically active polysaccharide\\nknown as acetylated mannose, or acemannan. This sub-\\nstance has been shown to be a highly effective immune\\nstimulant, with activity against the viruses causing the\\nflu,measles, and early stages of AIDS. It has been used\\neffectively against some veterinary cancers, most no-\\ntably sarcoma, and is being investigated as an agent to be\\nused to treat cancer in humans. Acemannan is one of\\nmany saccharides contained in Aloe vera . Some of the\\nothers are arabinose, cellulose, galactose, mannose, and\\nxylose. Prostaglandins are a third important set of com-\\npounds, and are thought to play a major role in wound\\nhealing. Aloe vera also contains fatty acids, enzymes,\\namino acids , vitamins, minerals, and other substances.\\nThe interaction of all these components produces a fa-\\nvorable environment for wound healing.\\nGeneral use\\nFew botanicals are as well known or as highly\\nthought of as the Aloe vera plant. Throughout recorded\\nhistory, it has been used to keep skin beautiful and re-\\nstore it to health. A frequent moisturizing ingredient in\\ncosmetics and hair care products, it also promotes the\\nhealing of burns and superficial wounds, but should not\\nbe used on deep or surgical wounds of punctures. Topi-\\ncal application has been successful in treatment of sun-\\nburn, frostbite, radiation injuries , some types of der-\\nmatitis, psoriasis, cuts, insect stings, poison ivy, ulcera-\\ntions, abrasions, and other dermatologic problems. Heal-\\ning is promoted by the anti-inflammatory components,\\nincluding several glycoproteins and salicylates, and sub-\\nstances that stimulate growth of skin and connective tis-\\nsue.

It also exerts antifungal and an-\\ntibacterial effects, and thus helps to prevent wound in-\\nfections. One study showed it to have a little more activ-\\nity than the antiseptic silver sulfadiazine against a num-\\nber of common bacteria that can infect the skin. It has\\nmoisturizing and pain relieving properties for the skin\\nlesions, in addition to healing effects.\\nAloe vera gel products may also be used internally.\\nThey should not contain the laxative chemicals found in\\nthe latex layer. There is some evidence that Aloe vera\\njuice has a beneficial effect on peptic ulcers, perhaps in-\\nhibiting the causative bacteria,Helicobacter pylori. It ap-\\npears to have a soothing effect on the ulcer, and interferes\\nwith the release of hydrochloric acid by the stomach.\\nColitis and other conditions of the intestinal tract may\\nalso respond favorably to the internal use of gel products.\\nAloe verahas been shown to exert a stabilizing effect on\\nblood sugar in studies done on mice, indicating a possible\\nplace for it in the treatment of diabetes. One study sug-\\ngested that giving Aloe vera extract orally to patients with\\nasthma who are not dependent on steroids could improve\\nsymptoms. A health care provider should be consulted\\nabout these uses. Other suggested, but insufficiently\\nproven, indications for oral Aloe vera gel include preven-\\ntion of kidney stones and relief of arthritis pain.\\nAloe vera products derived from the latex layer are\\ntaken orally for the laxative effect. They can cause\\npainful contractions of the bowel if taken in high doses.\\nMilder measures are recommended first.\\nThe concentration of the immune stimulant aceman-\\nnan is variable in the natural plant, as well as gel and\\njuice products, but it is also available in a purified, stan-\\ndardized, pharmaceutical grade form. An injectable type\\nis used in veterinary medicine to treat fibrosarcoma and\\nfeline leukemia , a condition caused by a virus in the\\nsame family as AIDS.\\nPreparations\\nCommercial products\\nChoosing effective Aloe vera products can be chal-\\nlenging. Once a leaf is cut, enzymes start to break down\\nsome of the long chain sugars which make Aloe vera gel\\nan effective healing product, so it is important for the\\nplant to have been properly handled and stabilized. Ask\\nfor help in selecting a reputable company to buy from.\\nWhen shopping for a product to use for topical healing,\\nlook for Aloe vera to be one of the first products listed to\\nensure that it is not too dilute to be efficacious. Commer-\\ncial, stabilized gel products may not work as well as the\\nfresh gel, but cold processing is thought to best retain the\\nbeneficial properties. The FDA does not regulate label-\\ning of Aloe vera products.\\nAloe vera juice is most often the form of the gel that\\nis used internally. At least half of the juice should be\\nAloe veragel. If laxative properties are not desired, be\\nsure that the juice does not contain latex. A product that\\nis made from the whole leaf does not necessarily contain\\nanthraquinones from the latex layer, as those are water-\\nsoluble and can be separated out during processing. Cap-\\nsules and tinctures of the gel are also available. Oral\\nforms of the latex extract are generally capsules, as it is\\nextremely bitter.\\nGrowing aloe at home\\nFor common topical use, keeping an Aloe vera plant\\nat home is one of the easiest ways to get the freshest and\\nmost concentrated gel. It is easy to cultivate, requiring\\nonly good drainage, mild temperatures, and occasional\\nwatering. Bring the plant inside if outside temperatures\\nare less than 40°F (4.4°C). It will tolerate either full or\\npartial sunlight, but will require more frequent watering\\nin full sun. Water it only when the soil has become dry.\\nTo use the gel, break off a leaf and cut it lengthwise to\\nexpose the inner layer. Scoop the gel out and apply gen-\\nerously to the area needing treatment. Discard whatever\\ngel is not used immediately, as it will degenerate quickly.\\nThe inner portion of the leaf may also be applied directly\\nto a skin injury, and bound to it.\\nPrecautions\\nAloe vera gel is generally safe for topical use, but it\\nis best to apply it to a small area first to test for possible\\nallergic reaction. Stinging and generalized dermatitis\\nmay result in individuals who are sensitive to it. The vast\\nmajority of the warnings apply only to products contain-\\ning anthraquinones, such as aloin and barbaloin (as well\\nas the numerous others), which are found in the latex\\nlayer of the plant. Aloe vera latex should not be used in-\\nternally by women who are pregnant or lactating, or by\\nchildren. This product can cause abortion or stimulate\\nmenstruation. It may pass into the milk of breastfeeding\\nmothers. People who have abnormal kidney function,\\nheart disease, or gastrointestinal diseases are best ad-\\nvised to avoid any product containing Aloe vera latex or\\nanthraquinones. Prolonged, internal use in high doses\\nmay produce tolerance so that more is required to obtain\\nthe laxative effect. Be aware of the possibility that any\\nAloe veraproduct for internal use that is supposed to\\ncontain only the gel portion can become contaminated\\nby the anthraquinones of the latex layer. For this reason,\\npeople who have a contraindication for using Aloe vera\\nlatex should use caution when taking an Aloe vera gel\\nproduct internally.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 262\\nAloe\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 62'),\n",

Alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs)\\nare use in topical skin care products to exfoliate, or\\nslough away, dead skin cells and promote collagen\\ngrowth. They can be useful in promoting smoother,\\neven-toned skin and may reduce the appearance of wrin-\\nkles and fine lines in some individuals.\\nAHAs are available in a number of different synthet-\\nic and natural formulations. Lactic AHA is derived from\\nmilk products, while glycolic AHA is derived from sug-\\narcane. Other AHA compounds include citric acid (from\\nfruit) and malic acid (from apples).\\nGeneral use\\nAHAs work by removing dead cells at the surface of\\nthe skin. In higher concentrations, it promotes collagen\\nproduction, which may reduce the appearance of fine\\nlines and wrinkles in the skin. The acids penetrate deep\\ninto the skin, where they actually begin to damage skin\\ncells. This skin damage triggers the production of colla-\\ngen, a fibrous protein and a building block of tissue and\\nskin, as the body attempts to repair the cell damage.\\nCosmetic, over-the-counter preparations of alpha-\\nhydroxy must contain less than 10% of the compound\\naccording to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\nregulations. This is a high enough concentration to pro-\\nmote exfoliation, but not potent enough to generate col-\\nlagen production. The concentration of AHA required to\\nproduce this effect is only available with a prescription\\nfrom a dermatologist or licensed healthcare professional,\\nor through professionally administered treatments from a\\nlicensed cosmetologist.\\nGuidelines recommended by the trade regulatory as-\\nsociation Cosmetic Ingredient Review have been adapted\\nby the U.S. FDA for consumer AHA products.

It may possibly compound the risk of toxicity\\nwhen used with cardiac glycosides (both prescription\\nand herbal types) and antiarrhythmic drugs. Absorption\\nof other oral medications can be decreased. Aloe vera\\nlatex should not be used with other laxative herbs, which\\nmay also lead to excessive potassium loss.\\nInternal use of Aloe vera gel can cause changes in\\nblood sugar, so diabetics should monitor blood glucose\\nlevels during use, particularly if insulin or other pharma-\\nceuticals are being used to control hyperglycemia.\\nTopical Aloe vera may enhance the effect of topical\\ncorticosteroids and allow a reduction in the amount of\\nthe steroid being used.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBratman, Steven and David Kroll.

Trained cosmetologists are permitted\\nto use AHA concentrations as high as 30%, provided\\nthese products have a pH level of 3.0 or higher. Health-\\ncare professionals such as dermatologists typically use\\nconcentrations as high as 50–70%.\\nPreparations\\nAHA preparations are available in over the counter\\nand prescription gel, lotion, toner, and cream formula-\\ntions. An over-the-counter formula that contains between\\n5–8% AHA may be more effective. Because FDA regu-\\nlates these products as cosmetics and not drugs, the man-\\nufacturer is not required to list the strength of AHA on\\nthe package labeling. However, product ingredients must\\nbe listed sequentially in the order of highest concentra-\\ntion, so products which list AHA compounds second or\\nthird are usually more beneficial than those who list\\nthem in the middle to end of the ingredient list.\\nThe pH level of an AHA product is also important to\\nthe product’s effectiveness. A higher pH level means the\\nproduct is less acidic and gentler on the skin, however, a\\nhigher pH can also lessen the overall potency of the\\nproduct. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review guidelines for\\nAHA products specify that consumer AHA products\\nmust have a pH of 3.5 or more.\\nDepending on their skin type, certain individuals\\nmay find some carrier formulas (i.e., cream, gel, lotion,\\ntoner) more effective than others. Those with dry skin\\nmay find moisturizing AHA creams and lotions more ef-\\nfective, while individuals with oily skin may prefer a less\\noily toner or gel.\\nIndividuals who are prescribed AHA formulations\\nby a healthcare professional should follow their doctor’s\\ndirections for use of the product.\\nPrecautions\\nBuy only those AHA products that conform to the\\nCosmetic Ingredient Review and FDA recommended\\nguidelines of 10% or less AHA with a 3.5 or higher pH\\nlevel.\\nOver-the-counter AHA preparations (those with less\\nthan 10% AHA) are designated as cosmetics, rather than\\ndrugs, by the U.S. FDA, and therefore do not have to un-\\ndergo the rigorous testing, review, and approval process\\nrequired of medical products. In addition, labeling for\\ncosmetics does not require a listing of the concentration\\nof ingredients, although some manufacturers provide this\\ninformation on their labeling voluntarily. Individuals\\nshould try to purchase AHA products that provide de-\\ntailed ingredient and concentration information to ensure\\nthey are purchasing true AHA ingredients in a therapeu-\\ntic concentration. In addition, if an individual experi-\\nences a reaction to an AHA product, they can use de-\\ntailed labeling to decide if a lower concentration of the\\nproduct is available and may be right for them.\\nIndividuals who are considering using AHA prod-\\nucts for the first time, or who are switching the type of\\nAHA product they use, should perform a skin patch test\\nto check for skin sensitivity to the substance. A small,\\ndime sized drop of the AHA product should be applied\\nto a small patch of skin inside the elbow or wrist. The\\nskin patch should be monitored for 24 hours to ensure no\\nexcessive redness, swelling, blistering, or rash occurs. If\\na reaction does occur, the test can be repeated with an\\nAHA product with a lower alpha-hydroxy acid concen-\\ntration. Individuals who experience a severe reaction to a\\nskin patch test of AHA are advised not to use the prod-\\nuct. A dermatologist or other healthcare professional\\nmay be able to recommend a suitable alternative.\\nAHA products may increase sun sensitivity. Individ-\\nuals using AHA products should use a high SPF (at least\\n15 SPF) sunscreen over the AHA formula to protect\\nagainst burning. Sunscreen should be applied no less\\nthan 15 minutes after the AHA formula is applied to pre-\\nvent neutralizing the acids. Shading the face with a wide-\\nbrimmed hat may also be useful. Results of a 1999 FDA\\nstudy on the use of AHA and UV damage showed that,\\nwhile AHA decreases the time required for skin to begin\\nto burn, discontinuing use of the AHA product returned\\nskin to normal within a week.\\nExfoliative products should be used with care, as\\nover-exfoliation can cause damage to the skin. AHA\\nproducts should not be combined with other exfoliative\\nproducts such as facial scrubs, buff pads, or loofahs. In\\naddition, individuals should only use one AHA product\\nat a time.\\nHigher concentration prescription AHA products\\nhave a great likelihood of producing side effects, so indi-\\nviduals taking them should contact their healthcare\\nprovider immediately if they experience burning, red-\\nness, or any other reaction to the product.\\nIndividuals who experience adverse reactions to\\nAHA treatments should report them to both the manu-\\nfacturer of the product and to the FDA’s Office of Cos-\\nmetics and Colors. A patient’s dermatologist or health-\\ncare provider can also make this report anonymously for\\nthe patient.

AD usually occurs in old age, and\\nis marked by a decline in cognitive functions such as re-\\nmembering, reasoning, and planning.\\nDescription\\nA person with AD usually has a gradual decline in\\nmental functions, often beginning with slight memory\\nloss, followed by losses in the ability to maintain employ-\\nment, to plan and execute familiar tasks of daily living,\\nand to reason and exercise judgment. Communication\\nability, mood, and personality may also be affected. Most\\npeople who have AD die within eight years of their diag-\\nnosis, although that interval may be as short as one year\\nor as long as 20 years. AD is the fourth leading cause of\\ndeath in adults after heart disease, cancer, and stroke.\\nBetween two and four million Americans have AD;\\nthat number is expected to grow to as many as 14 million\\nby the middle of the twenty-first century as the popula-\\ntion as a whole ages. While a small number of people in\\nAHA chemical peels and other high concentration\\nAHA treatments should only be administered by a li-\\ncensed cosmetologist, licensed dermatologist, or other\\nqualified healthcare professional.\\nSide effects\\nPossible side effects of AHA products include:\\n• Increased sun sensitivity. Individuals who use AHA are\\noften more sensitive to UV rays.\\n• Excessive redness and burning. In high concentrations\\nand/or with individuals with sensitive skin, AHA can\\ncause redness, burning, and even blistering.\\n• Swelling. AHA products can cause swelling of the skin\\nand/or eyes.\\n• Contact dermatitis. AHA can cause an allergic skin re-\\naction characterized by rash and itching in some indi-\\nviduals.\\n• Skin discoloration. Some cases of AHA-related skin\\ndiscoloration have been reported.\\nThe FDA has sponsored a joint study with the Na-\\ntional Toxicology Program to further assess the long-\\nterm consequences of AHA product use. Results of the\\nstudy were not yet available as of July 2000.\\nInteractions\\nThere are no known interactions between alpha-hy-\\ndroxy acid products and other medications and sub-\\nstances when administered in recommended strengths.\\nHowever, because over-the-counter AHA products are\\nconsidered cosmetics and not pharmaceuticals, existing\\nresearch on possible interactions is minimal.\\nAlpha-hydroxy products may enhance the effects of\\nother products or medications with similar therapeutic\\nproperties.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 65\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nContact dermatitis—Inflammation and redness of\\nthe skin caused by an irritating substance.\\nExfoliate—To shed skin.

Reproduced\\nby permission.)\\nWhat triggers the formation of plaques and tangles\\nis unknown, although there are several possible candi-\\ndates. Inflammation of the brain may play a role in their\\ndevelopment, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs (NSAIDs) seems to reduce the risk of developing\\nAD. Restriction of blood flow may be part of the prob-\\nlem, perhaps accounting for the beneficial effects of es-\\ntrogen that increases blood flow in the brain, among its\\nother effects. Highly reactive molecular fragments called\\nfree radicals damage cells of all kinds, especially brain\\ncells, which have smaller supplies of protective antioxi-\\ndants thought to protect against free radical damage.\\nSeveral genes have been implicated in AD, includ-\\ning the gene for amyloid precursor protein, or APP, re-\\nsponsible for producing amyloid. Mutations in this gene\\nare linked to some cases of the relatively uncommon\\nearly-onset forms of AD. In 2001, scientists discovered a\\nnew rare mutation of the APP gene that might lead to\\nnew understanding on how the disease develops and new\\ntreatment possibilities. Other cases of early-onset AD are\\ncaused by mutations in the gene for another protein,\\ncalled pre-senilin. AD eventually affects nearly everyone\\nwith Down syndrome, caused by an extra copy of chro-\\nmosome 21. Other mutations on other chromosomes\\nhave been linked to other early-onset cases.\\nPotentially the most important genetic link was dis-\\ncovered in the early 1990s on chromosome 19. A gene\\non this chromosome, called apoE, codes for a protein in-\\nvolved in transporting lipids into neurons. ApoE occurs\\nin at least three forms—apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4. Each\\nperson inherits one apoE from each parent, and therefore\\ncan either have one copy of two different forms, or two\\ncopies of one. Compared to those without ApoE4, people\\nwith one copy are about three times as likely to develop\\nlate-onset AD, and those with two copies are almost four\\ntimes as likely to do so. Despite this important link, not\\neveryone with apoE4 develops AD, and people without it\\ncan still have the disease. Why apoE4 increases the\\nchances of developing AD is not known.\\nThere are several risk factors that increase a per-\\nson’s likelihood of developing AD. The most significant\\none is age; older people develop AD at much higher rates\\nthan younger ones. Another risk factor is having a family\\nhistory of AD, Down syndrome, or Parkinson’s disease.\\nPeople who have had head trauma or hypothyroidism\\nmay manifest the symptoms of AD more quickly. No\\nother medical conditions have been linked to an in-\\ncreased risk for AD.\\nMany environmental factors have been suspected of\\ncontributing to AD, but population studies have not borne\\nout these links. Among these have been pollutants in\\ndrinking water, aluminum from commercial products, and\\ntheir 40s and 50s develop the disease (called early-onset\\nAD), AD predominantly affects the elderly. AD affects\\nabout 3% of all people between ages 65 and 74, about\\n19% of those between 75 and 84, and about 47% of\\nthose over 85. Slightly more women than men are affect-\\ned with AD, but this may be because women tend to live\\nlonger, leaving a higher proportion of women in the most\\naffected age groups.\\nThe cost of caring for a person with AD is consider-\\nable, and has been estimated at approximately $174,000\\nper person over the course of the disease. Most people\\nwith AD are cared for at home; the cost of extended\\nnursing home care adds substantially to this estimate.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe cause or causes of AD are unknown. Some\\nstrong leads have been found through recent research,\\nand these have also given some theoretical support to\\nseveral new experimental treatments.\\nAD affects brain cells, mostly those in brain regions\\nresponsible for learning, reasoning, and memory. Autop-\\nsies of persons with AD show that these regions of the\\nbrain become clogged with two abnormal structures—\\nneurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. Neurofibril-\\nlary tangles are twisted masses of protein fibers inside\\nnerve cells, or neurons. Senile plaques are composed of\\nparts of neurons surrounding a group of brain proteins\\ncalled beta-amyloid deposits. While it is not clear exact-\\nly how these structures cause problems, some re-\\nsearchers now believe that their formation is in fact re-\\nsponsible for the mental changes of AD, presumably by\\ninterfering with the normal communication between\\nneurons in the brain.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 66'),\n",

Further\\nresearch may yet turn up links to other environmental cul-\\nprits, although no firm candidates have been identified.\\nThe symptoms of AD begin gradually, usually with\\nshort-term memory loss. Occasional memory lapses are\\nof course common to everyone, and do not by them-\\nselves signify any change in cognitive function. The per-\\nson with AD may begin with only the routine sort of\\nmemory lapse—forgetting where the car keys are—but\\nprogress to more profound or disturbing losses, such as\\nforgetting that he or she can even drive a car. Becoming\\nlost or disoriented on a walk around the neighborhood\\nbecomes more likely as the disease progresses. A person\\nwith AD may forget the names of family members, or\\nforget what was said at the beginning of a sentence by\\nthe time he hears the end.\\nAs AD progresses, other symptoms appear, includ-\\ning inability to perform routine tasks, loss of judgment,\\nand personality or behavior changes. Some patients have\\ntrouble sleeping and may suffer from confusion or agita-\\ntion in the evening (“sunsetting”). In some cases, people\\nwith AD repeat the same ideas, movements, words, or\\nthoughts, a behavior known as perseveration. Some pa-\\ntients may exhibit inappropriate sexual behaviors. In the\\nfinal stages of the disease, people may have severe prob-\\nlems with eating, communicating, and controlling their\\nbladder and bowel functions.\\nThe Alzheimer’s Association has developed a list of 10\\nwarning signs of AD. A person with several of these symp-\\ntoms should see a physician for a thorough evaluation:\\n• memory loss that affects job skills\\n• difficulty performing familiar tasks\\n• problems with language\\n• disorientation of time and place\\n• poor or decreased judgment\\n• problems with abstract thinking\\n• misplacing things\\n• changes in mood or behavior\\n• changes in personality\\n• loss of initiative\\nOther types of dementing illnesses, including some\\nthat are reversible, can cause similar symptoms. It is im-\\nportant for the person with these symptoms to be evalu-\\nated by a professional who can weigh the possibility that\\nhis or her symptoms may have another cause. Approxi-\\nmately 20% of those originally suspected of having AD\\nturn out to have some other disorder; about half of these\\ncases are treatable.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of AD is complex, and may require office\\nvisits to several different specialists over several months\\nbefore a diagnosis can be made. While a confident provi-\\nsional diagnosis may be made in most cases after thor-\\nough testing, AD cannot be definitively diagnosed until\\nautopsy examination of the brain for senile plaques and\\nneurofibrillary tangles.\\nThe diagnosis of AD begins with a thorough physi-\\ncal exam and complete medical history. Except in the\\ndisease’s earliest stages, accurate history from family\\nmembers or caregivers is essential. Since there are both\\nprescription and over-the-counter drugs that can cause\\nthe same mental changes as AD, a careful review of the\\npatient’s drug, medicine, and alcohol use is important.\\nAD-like symptoms can also be provoked by other med-\\nical conditions, including tumors, infection, and demen-\\ntia caused by mild strokes (multi-infarct dementia).\\nThese possibilities must be ruled out as well through ap-\\npropriate blood and urine tests, brain magnetic resonance\\nimaging (MRI) or computed tomography scans (CT),\\ntests of the brain’s electrical activity (electroencephalo-\\ngraphs or EEGs), or other tests.\\nIn 2001, researchers demonstrated that postitron\\nemission tomography (PET) scans could help predict who\\nmight develop memory impairment. Although PET scan-\\nning is a relatively new and expensive technology, it is be-\\ncoming more readily available. Several types of oral and\\nwritten tests are used to aid in the AD diagnosis and to fol-\\nlow its progression, including tests of mental status, func-\\ntional abilities, memory, and concentration. Still, the neu-\\nrologic exam is normal in most patients in early stages.\\nOne of the most important parts of the diagnostic\\nprocess is to evaluate the patient for depression and\\ndelirium, since each of these can be present with AD, or\\nmay be mistaken for it. (Delirium involves a decreased\\nconsciousness or awareness of one’s environment.) De-\\npression and memory loss are both common in the elder-\\nly, and the combination of the two can often be mistaken\\nfor AD. Depression can be treated with drugs, although\\nsome antidepressants can worsen dementia if it is pre-\\nsent, further complicating both diagnosis and treatment.\\nA genetic test for the ApoE4 gene is available, but is\\nnot used for diagnosis, because possessing even two\\ncopies does not ensure that a person will develop AD.\\nTreatment\\nThe mainstay of treatment for a person with AD con-\\ntinues to be the establishment of daily routines and good\\nnursing care, providing both physical and emotional sup-\\nport for the patient.

Regular medical care by a practitioner\\nwith a non-defeatist attitude toward AD is important so\\nthat illnesses can be diagnosed and treated properly.\\nPeople with AD are also often depressed or anxious,\\nand may suffer from sleeplessness, poor nutrition , and\\ngeneral poor health. Each of these conditions is treatable\\nto some degree. It is important for the person with AD to\\neat well and continue to exercise. Professional advice\\nfrom a nutritionist may be useful to provide healthy,\\neasy-to-prepare meals. Finger foods may be preferable to\\nthose requiring utensils to be eaten. Regular exercise (su-\\npervised for safety if necessary) promotes overall health.\\nA calm, structured environment with simple tools that\\nsupport orientation (like calendars and clocks) may re-\\nduce anxiety and increase safety.\\nDiet and supplements\\nDIET. The incidence of AD is lower in countries\\nwhose citizens have a diet that is lower in fats and calo-\\nries. There have been a few reports that a diet rich with\\nfish improves mental function in patients with AD or de-\\nmentia. AD patients treated with essential fatty acids\\nshowed greater improvement in mood and mental func-\\ntion than patients on placebo. Because of its disease-pre-\\nventing properties, red wine in moderation may be bene-\\nficial to AD patients.\\nVITAMIN E. Studies have shown that AD patients\\nhave lower blood levels of vitamin E than age matched\\ncontrol subjects. A large, two year study of moderately\\naffected AD patients found that taking 2,000 IU of vita-\\nmin E daily significantly delayed disease progression as\\ncompared to patients taking placebo. This delay was\\nequivalent to that seen with patients taking the drug se-\\nlegiline. Vitamin E is also thought to delay AD onset.\\nHigh levels of vitamin E put the patient at higher risk for\\nbleeding disorders.\\nTHIAMINE (VITAMIN B 1). Several small studies to\\ndetermine the effectiveness of thiamine (vitamin B1) on\\nAD have been carried out. Daily doses of 3 g for two to\\nthree months have improved mental function and AD as-\\nsessment scores. Other studies have shown that thiamine\\nhad no effect on AD patients. Side effects include nau-\\nsea and indigestion.\\nCOBALAMIN (VITAMIN B 12). Although results are\\nconflicting, some studies have found that AD patients\\nhave lower levels of cobalamin (vitamin B 12) than oth-\\ners. Some studies have shown that cobalamin supple-\\nmentation improves memory and mental function in AD\\npatients whereas other studies have found no effect.\\nACETYL-L-CARNITINE. Acetyl-L-carnitine is similar\\nin structure to the neurotransmitter acetyl-choline. Stud-\\nies have shown that 2 g or 3 g of acetyl- L-carnitine daily\\nslows the progression of AD, especially in patients who\\ndeveloped the disease before age 66. Patients who devel-\\noped disease after 66 years of age worsened with treat-\\nment. Side effects include increased appetite,body\\nodor, and rash.\\nDHEA. DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a steroid\\nhormone. There may be a link between decreasing levels\\nof DHEA in the elderly and development of AD. Studies\\non the effect, if any, of DHEA on AD are needed. Side\\neffects include acne, hair growth, irritability, insomnia,\\nheadache, and menstrual irregularity.\\nMELATONIN. Melatonin is a hormone that helps to\\nregulate mood and sleep cycles. The effect of melatonin\\ntreatment on AD is unknown but it may be beneficial in\\nregulating sleep cycles. The usual dose is 3 mg taken one\\nto two hours before bedtime. Side effects are drowsiness,\\nconfusion, headache, decreased sex drive, and decreased\\nbody temperature.\\nHerbals and Chinese medicine\\nGINKGO. Ginkgo, the extract from the Ginkgo bilo-\\nba tree is the most commonly used herbal treatment for\\nAD. Several studies have been performed to test the ef-\\nfectiveness of ginkgo for treating AD. The dose range\\nstudied were 120–160 mg daily divided into three doses.\\nAlthough results have been mixed, the evidence suggests\\nthat ginkgo is an effective treatment for patients with\\nmild to moderate AD. Side effects are not common but\\ninclude headache, allergic skin reaction, and gastroin-\\ntestinal disturbance. Ginkgo also decreases blood coagu-\\nlation. Individuals with coagulation or platelet disorders\\nshould use extreme caution and consult a physician be-\\nfore using ginkgo.\\nPHYTOESTROGENS. Phytoestrogens may be benefi-\\ncial in the treatment of AD based on the findings that\\nwomen with AD who are on hormone replacement thera-\\npy have improved mental function and mood. Estrogens\\nmay prevent AD, therefore, phytoestrogens may have the\\nsame effect. Phytoestrogens are mainly found in soy\\nproducts.\\nCLUBMOSS. Huperzine A is a compound isolated\\nfrom clubmoss ( Huperzia serrata ). Studies have shown\\nthat taking 0.1–0.4 mg daily improves mental function in\\nAD patients.

Participation in a music\\ntherapy group was more effective at improving memory\\nand decreasing agitation than being part of a verbal (talk-\\ning) group.\\nA wide variety of other therapies have been benefi-\\ncial in the treatment of the psychologic symptoms of\\nAD. These include:\\n• Light therapy in the evening to improve sleep cycle dis-\\nturbances.\\n• Supportive therapy through touch, compliments, and\\ndisplays of affection.\\n• Sensory stimulation through massage and aromatherapy.\\n• Socio-environmental therapies use activities fitted to\\nprevious interests, favorite foods, and pleasant sur-\\nroundings.\\n• Cognitive therapy to reduce negative perceptions and\\nlearn coping strategies.\\n• Insight-oriented psychotherapy addresses the patient’s\\nawareness of his or her disease.\\n• Dance therapy.\\n• Validation therapy.\\n• Reminiscence therapy.\\n• Reality-oriented therapy.\\nNursing care and safety\\nThe nursing care required for a person with AD is\\neasy to learn. Caregivers will usually need to spend in-\\ncreasing amounts of time grooming the patient as the dis-\\nease progresses. The patient may require assisted feeding\\nearly on to make sure that he or she is taking in enough\\nnutrients. Later on, as movement and swallowing become\\ndifficult, a feeding tube may be placed into the stomach\\nthrough the abdominal wall. A feeding tube requires more\\nattention, but is generally easy to care for if the patient is\\nnot resistant to its use. Incontinence becomes the most dif-\\nficult problem to deal with at home, and is a principal rea-\\nson for pursuing nursing home care. In the early stages,\\nlimiting fluid intake and increasing the frequency of toilet-\\ning can help. Careful attention to hygiene is important to\\nprevent skin irritation and infection from soiled clothing.\\nIn all cases, a person diagnosed with AD should not\\nbe allowed to drive, because of the increased potential for\\naccidents and the increased likelihood of wandering very\\nfar from home while disoriented. In the home, simple\\nmeasures such as grab bars in the bathroom, bed rails on\\nthe bed, and easily negotiable passageways can greatly\\nincrease safety. Electrical appliances should be un-\\nplugged and put away when not in use. Matches, lighters,\\nknives, or weapons should be stored safely out of reach.\\nThe hot water heater temperature may be set lower to pre-\\nvent accidental scalding. A list of emergency numbers,\\nincluding the poison control center and the hospital emer-\\ngency room, should be posted by the phone.\\nCare for the caregiver\\nFamily members or others caring for a person with\\nAD have an extremely difficult and stressful job that be-\\ncomes harder as the disease progresses. It is common for\\ncaregivers to develop feelings of anger, resentment, guilt,\\nand hopelessness, in addition to the sorrow they feel for\\ntheir loved one and for themselves. Depression is an ex-\\ntremely common consequence. Becoming a member of\\nan AD caregivers’ support group can be one of the most\\nimportant things a family member does, not only for him\\nor herself, but for the person with AD as well. The loca-\\ntion and contact numbers for AD caregiver support\\ngroups are available from the Alzheimer’s Association;\\nthey may also be available through a local social service\\nagency, the patient’s physician, or pharmaceutical com-\\npanies that manufacture the drugs used to treat AD.\\nMedical treatment for depression may be an important\\nadjunct to group support.\\nOutside help, nursing homes, and\\ngovernmental assistance\\nMost families eventually need outside help to relieve\\nsome of the burden of around-the-clock care for a person\\nwith AD. Personal care assistants, either volunteer or\\npaid, may be available through local social service agen-\\ncies. Adult daycare facilities are becoming increasingly\\ncommon. Meal delivery, shopping assistance, or respite\\ncare may be available as well. Many families consider\\nnursing home care when AD advances to the late-stage.\\nSeveral federal government programs may ease the\\ncost of caring for a person with AD, including Social Se-\\ncurity Disability, Medicare, and Supplemental Security\\nIncome. Each of these programs may provide some as-\\nsistance for care, medication, or other costs, but none of\\nthem will pay for nursing home care indefinitely. Medic-\\naid is a state-funded program that may provide for some\\nor all of the cost of nursing home care, although there are\\nimportant restrictions. Details of the benefits and eligi-\\nbility requirements of these programs are available\\nthrough the local Social Security or Medicaid office, or\\nfrom local social service agencies.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe only two drugs approved for AD, tacrine hy-\\ndrochloride (Cognex) and donepezil hydrochloride (Ari-\\ncept), increase the brain levels of the neurotransmitter\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 69\\nAlzheimer’s disease\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 69'),\n",

These drugs can modestly in-\\ncrease cognition and improve the ability to perform normal\\nactivities of daily living. The most significant side effect of\\ntacrine is an increase in the liver enzyme alanine amino-\\ntransferase (ALT). Patients taking tacrine must have a\\nweekly blood test to monitor their ALT levels. Other fre-\\nquent side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, ab-\\ndominal pain, indigestion, and skin rash. Donepezil has\\ntwo advantages over tacrine: fewer side effects and once\\ndaily dosing. Donepezil does not appear to affect liver en-\\nzymes and the frequency of abdominal side effects is lower.\\nEstrogen, the female sex hormone, is widely pre-\\nscribed for post-menopausal women to prevent osteo-\\nporosis. Several preliminary studies have shown that\\nwomen taking estrogen have lower rates of AD, and\\nthose who develop AD have a slower progression and\\nless severe symptoms.\\nPreliminary studies have also suggested a reduced\\nrisk for developing AD in older people who regularly use\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-\\ning aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), and naproxen (Aleve), al-\\nthough not acetaminophen. A 2001 study reported that\\nthose subjects who used NSAIDs for at least two years\\nwere up to 80% less likely to develop Alzheimer’s. Fur-\\nther study on the effects of NSAIDs on AD are underway.\\nSelegiline, a drug used in the treatment of Parkin-\\nson’s disease, appears to slow the development of AD.\\nSelegiline is thought to act as an antioxidant, preventing\\nfree radical damage. However, it also acts as a stimulant,\\nmaking it difficult to determine whether the delay in\\nonset of AD symptoms is due to protection from free\\nradicals or to the general elevation of brain activity from\\nthe stimulant effect.\\nPsychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety,\\nhallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren’t\\nthere), and delusions (false beliefs) may be treated with\\ndrugs if necessary.\\nExpected results\\nWhile Alzheimer’s disease may not be the direct\\ncause of death, the generally poorer health of a person\\nwith AD increases the risk of life-threatening infection,\\nincluding pneumonia . In addition, other diseases com-\\nmon in old age (cancer, stroke, and heart disease) may\\nlead to more severe consequences in a person with AD.\\nOn average, people with AD live eight years past their\\ndiagnosis, with a range from 1-20 years.\\nPrevention\\nThere is currently no sure way to prevent Alzheimer’s\\ndisease, though some of the drug treatments discussed\\nabove may eventually be proven to reduce the risk of de-\\nveloping the disease. The most likely current candidates\\nare estrogen, phytoestrogens, NSAIDs, vitamin E, and se-\\nlegiline. In 2001, researchers found preliminary indica-\\ntions that onest of Alzheimer’s might be tied to choles-\\nterol levels. Although results must be confirmed by other\\nscientists, lowering cholesterol in the diet might help pre-\\nvent onset of the disease.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBridges, Barbara J., Therapeutic Caregiving: A Practical\\nGuide for Caregivers of Persons with Alzheimer’s and\\nOther Dementia Causing Diseases.BJB Publishing 16212\\nBothell Way S.E., Suite F171 Mill Creek, Washington\\n98012-1219.\\nCarrier, Louise, and Henry Brodaty. “Mood and Behaviour\\nManagement.” In Clinical Diagnosis and Management of\\nAlzheimer’s Disease.2nd edition, edited by Serge Gauthi-\\ner.

They are essential to human metabolism, and to\\nmaking the human body function properly for good\\nhealth. Of the 28 amino acids known to exist, eight of\\nthem are considered “essential,” defined as those that can\\nbe obtained only through food. These essential amino\\nacids are tryptophan,lysine, methionine, phenylalaine,\\nthreonine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. The “non–es-\\nsential” amino acids include arginine, tyrosine, glycine,\\nserine, glutmamic acid, aspartic acid, taurine, cycstine,\\nhistidine, proline, alanine, and creatine, which is a com-\\nbination of arginine, glycine, and methionine.\\nThe human body, minus water, is 75% amino acids.\\nAll of the neurotransmitters (proteins) but one are com-\\nposed of amino acids; and 95% of hormones are amino\\nacids. Amino acids are key to every human bodily func-\\ntion with every chemical reaction that occurs.\\nAmino acids occur naturally in certain foods, such as\\ndairy products, meats, fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, and eggs.\\nThose sources are considered more complete than vegetable\\nprotein, such as beans, peas, and grains, also considered a\\ngood—even if not complete—source of amino acids.\\nAmino acids became popular as dietary supplements\\nby the end of the twentieth century for various uses, in-\\ncluding fitness training, weight loss, and certain chronic\\ndiseases. Claims exist in holistic medicine that indicate\\namino acid supplements taken in the proper dosage can\\naid also in fighting depression, allergies, heart disease,\\ngastrointestinal problems, high cholesterol , muscle\\nweakness, blood sugar problems, arthritis, insomnia ,\\nbipolar illness, epilepsy , chronic fatigue syndrome ,\\nautism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n(ADHD), and mental exhaustion.\\nDescription\\nAmino acid therapy as a supplemental aid to a healthy\\ndiet joined the fitness craze in the United States by the end\\nof the 1990s. According to author Brenda Adderly in Better\\nNutrition,in September of 1999, “The creation of new pro-\\ntein from amino acids and the breaking down of existing\\nprotein into amino acids are ongoing processes in our bod-\\nies. If, for example, you are working out and developing\\ncertain muscles, amino acids come to the rescue with new\\nprotein to build muscle cells,” Adderly noted. “Similarly,\\nwhen you eat a complete protein, such as meat or beans and\\nrice, the body breaks down the amino acids in that food for\\nlater use.” Understanding the balance of amino acids in the\\nbody can be often the first clue to understanding why a per-\\nson suffers many ailments, ranging from depression to\\nupset stomach to obesity. Deficiencies in the proper bal-\\nance of amino acids is likely to occur in those with poor\\ndiets. Because stress, age, infection, and various other fac-\\ntors including the amount of exercise a person does, can\\nalso affect the levels of amino acids, people with healthy,\\nnutritious diets could also find that they also suffer deficien-\\ncies. Adderly adds that, “Not only are the symptoms of\\namino acid deficiencies wide ranging, but there are no\\nRDAs (recommended daily allowances) or other guidelines,\\nto help us tell if we are least covering all the bases. Add to\\nthat the complicated matter of keeping track of all 28 some\\nwith names most of us have never even heard and the situa-\\ntion begins to seem overwhelming.”\\nEssential amino acids\\nThe amino acids, which are derived only from food and\\nthat the body cannot manufacture, perform various functions.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 71\\nAmino acids\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 71'),\n",

Nature’s “brain food” that increases\\nmental prowess; helps speed the healing of ulcers; aids\\nin combatting fatigue.\\nCreatine in the spotlight\\nOne of the most discussed amino acid supplements\\navailable on the market is creatine monohydrate. The body\\nproduces small amounts of creatine in the kidneys, liver,\\nand pancreas, making it a non-essential acid. With most\\ndiets that include red meat or fish, also come a few grams\\nof creatine. It is stored in muscle cells and is used in activ-\\nities, such as weight lifting and sprinting, providing the\\nnecessary thrust of energy for such activities. But the nat-\\nural supply of creatine produced by the body is quickly\\ndepleted. After approximately 10 seconds, when muscle\\nfatigue becomes apparent, the daily production is used.\\nAccording to Timothy Gower, writing for Esquire in\\nFebruary of 1998, “Scientists identified creatine 160–\\nodd years ago, but only in the 1980s did they figure out\\nthat muscle cells can be ‘loaded’ with up to 30% more of\\nthe compound than they normally carry. Since then, sev-\\neral studies have shown that weight lifters primed on the\\nsupplement tire less easily, allowing them to work out\\nlonger.” Gower also noted that creatine users find that\\nthe weight they add on is fat-free, whether that is lean\\ntissue or some is water weight, no one has yet deter-\\nmined, since muscle cells do fill with water during crea-\\ntine loading. Additionally, while it can add to the burst of\\nthe energy a sprinter needs to perform well, creatine\\ndoes not do anything for the marathon runner going for\\nseveral hours.\\nCommercially available since 1993, the long-term\\neffects still remain unknown. One 2002 study did show\\nthat creatine use improved rehabilitation for injured ath-\\nletes and another has shown that using the supplement\\ndoes not increase risk of injury. It should be noted that\\nsome 20–30% of people researched showed no improve-\\nment using creatine. One early report indicated that crea-\\ntine could be beneficial for some people in spurring me-\\ntabolism, burning calories and helping in weight loss.\\nThose reports were as yet inconclusive.\\nGeneral use\\nAmino acid supplements to a healthy diet are used\\nfor various purposes. The most common uses include:\\nsustaining strength in weight training to build muscles;\\nimproving heart and circulatory problems or diseases,\\nparticularly in the aging; the treatment of chronic fatigue\\nsyndrome; treating depression and anxiety; treating eat-\\ning disorders, such as bulimia and/or anorexia, along\\nwith overeating; increasing memory; building up and\\nsustaining the body’s immune system in fighting bacteria\\nand viruses. It is important to note that, while the neces-\\nsity and role of all amino acids has been verified in the\\nmaintenance of optimum health, research is not exten-\\nsive enough to provide indisputable verification of the\\ntouted benefits of such supplements over the long term.\\nNonetheless, some members of the scientific med-\\nical community would seem to confirm what amino acid\\nproponents have long believed to be true.

A common\\nway of taking amino acids is in a “multiple” amino acid\\ngel cap. These contain sources of protein from gelatin,\\nsoy, and whey. The market for supplements in wholesale,\\nretail, and internet sales was estimated to reach into the\\nmillions of dollars, with literally hundreds available. In-\\nternet sales were a fast-growing area particularly with\\nthe use of such supplements as creatine powder publi-\\ncized by well-known Olympic stars and professional ath-\\nletes. Daily usage of creatine as evident from research\\nindicated that usage should be leveled at 5 g of powder\\nin a glass of orange juice, and could be taken up to four\\ntimes a day during peak athletic training.

The\\nperennial grows wild in thickets throughout south Asia,\\nalthough it also may be cultivated. In summer and au-\\ntumn, clusters of small white flowers appear; it is har-\\nvested when the flowers begin to bloom. It is traditional-\\nly valued as an herbal remedy in China, where it grows\\nin the Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Sichuan,\\nJiangsu, and Jianxi provinces.\\nIn Mandarin, andrographis is called chuan xin lian,\\nYi jian xi and Lan he lian , which translate directly as\\n“thread-the-heart lotus.” The Cantonese term is chyun\\nsam ling , and the Japanese call it senshinren . English\\ncommon names include green chiretta, heart-thread lotus\\nleaf, and kariyat. Its pharmaceutical names, used to dis-\\ntinguish it as a medicine, are Herba Andrographitis Pan-\\niculatae or alternately Folium Andrographis.\\nGeneral use\\nPractitioners of Chinese medicine believe that andro-\\ngraphis affects the large intestine, lung, stomach, bladder,\\nand liver meridians, or energy pathways in the body. It is\\nthought to dispel heat (such as that associated with fever\\nor infection) and is used primarily as a broad-spectrum\\nantibiotic and immunostimulant for a variety of bacterial,\\nviral, and parasitic conditions, including influenza , in-\\ntestinal infections , hepatitis, pneumonia, and infected\\nwounds. Andrographis’s medicinal properties are consid-\\nered very bitter, astringent, cold, dry, and stimulating.\\nAndrographis is considered most effective for con-\\nditions associated with fever, inflammation, and the for-\\nmation of pus. It clears heat and relieves “fire toxicity”\\nmanifest as sores and carbuncles on the skin. It is also\\napplied topically for snakebite and eczema. Under the\\nsupervision of a qualified practitioner, it is used as a\\nuterine stimulant and abortive, to bring on miscarriage or\\ntreat prolonged pregnancy or retained placenta.\\nAndrographis can also be used as an inexpensive\\nsubstitute for another Chinese herb, coptis (huang lian).\\nResearch on andrographis has generally been conduct-\\ned in China and has focused on pharmacological investiga-\\ntion. Studies indicate that andrographis cultivated in the\\nplains of Shanghai has significant immune stimulating and\\nanti-infective qualities. In vitro, it inhibits the growth of\\nDiplococcus pneumoniaeand other bacteria and delays the\\ndeterioration of embryonic renal cells caused by a virus.\\nMajor chemical ingredients include andrographan,\\nandrographolide, neoandrographolide, paniculide A, 14-\\ndeoxy-11-oxyandrographolide, and beta-sitosterol.\\nPreparations\\nAndrographis is not generally available in American\\nhealth food stores, but it can be found at most Chinese\\npharmacies and Asian groceries.\\nThe standard dose ranges from 10-15 grams as a de-\\ncoction (strong tea) or 2-5 milliliters as a tincture. Pow-\\nder doses range from 0.6 to 1.2 grams.

It is a metabolite of DHEA, and as such,\\na direct precursor to the male hormone testosterone. It is\\nfound in some plant matter, notably pollen, and in the\\ngonads of all mammals.\\nGeneral use\\nSupplementation with androstenedione increases\\nblood levels of testosterone, which among other things,\\nwill lead to an increase in strength and muscle mass. As\\nsuch, it is mainly of interest to athletes and bodybuilders,\\nfor whom it has the added benefits of increasing energy\\nlevels, improving levels of nitrogen retention and shorten-\\ning muscle recovery time. Androstenedione is safer than\\nanabolic steroids because it has a far gentler effect on the\\nbody, and potential effects are milder and more transient.\\nAndrostenedione is also taken to improve well\\nbeing, and to raise levels of mental alertness. In addition,\\nit is thought to have a positive effect on sexual perfor-\\nmance. As androstenedione also aids in the conversion of\\nfatty tissue to muscle, it could conceivably be considered\\nan aid to weight loss.\\nThe German patent for androstenedione states that 50\\nmg administered orally raised testosterone levels from\\n140–183% above normal, which although impressive, is\\nconsiderably less than the increase associated with adminis-\\ntration of anabolic steroids. Also, it is a precursor, in that the\\nbody retains some control over production of testosterone.\\nPreparations\\nWhen taken orally, androstenedione is metabolized\\nby a single enzyme into testosterone. Athletes generally\\ntake between 50–300 mg daily, according to how much\\ntime is spent exercising and how much physical im-\\nprovement is required. Dosage is usually sublingual in\\nthe form of a spray or capsules. The spray is felt to be far\\n(Imperata cylindrical var. major, bai mao gen) for hot,\\npainful urinary disfunction.\\nPrecautions\\nAccording to tradition, andrographis is never used in\\ncases of deficient, cold intestinal conditions. When used\\nlong-term or in large doses, this bitter and cold herb may\\ndamage stomach qi, causing gastric distress and loss of\\nappetite.\\nAndrographis is also capable of producing a miscar-\\nriage, and thus should be avoided by pregnant women un-\\nless otherwise directed by a knowledgeable practitioner.\\nSide effects\\nGastric distress and loss of appetite have been noted\\nwhen the herb is taken in large doses.\\nInteractions\\nNo interactions with pharmaceutical drugs have\\nbeen noted.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBensky, D. and Gamble, Andrew.

It has a 2,000-year history of use,\\nand written records of its use date from 200 A.D. It is an\\nattractive-looking plant that belongs to the lily family. At\\nthe top of three-foot spikes, it has small, fragrant, white\\nsix-petaled flowers that bloom at night. The medicinal\\nparts are the rhizomes (roots) and the stems. Rhizomes\\nthat are large, hard, and round with pale-yellowish color\\ninside are best for medicinal use.\\nGeneral use\\nTraditional Chinese medicine classifies this herb\\nas cold (or yin) and bitter. Yin and yang are the two op-\\nposite energies that complement one another. Yin condi-\\ntions are described as cold, damp, and deficient, while\\nyang is characterized by heat, dry, and excess. Anemar-\\nrhena is used to treat heat disorders, which are caused by\\nexcessive yang or insufficient yin functions. When there\\nis excessive heat, dryness often follows. For example,\\nfever—an excessive internal heat symptom—is followed\\nby thirst, which is a sign of dryness. Traditional Chinese\\nmedicine uses bitter and cold herbs such as anemarrhena\\nto clear the internal heat and provide moisture to the\\nlungs and the kidneys.\\nBecause anemarrhena brings moisture and coolness,\\nit will bring relief to excessive internal heat and dryness\\nsymptoms such as fever, thirst, irritability, racing pulse,\\ncough, bleeding gums, night sweat, insomnia , and hot\\nflashes. Anemarrhena has been used in herbal combina-\\ntions such as Zhi Bai Di Huang Wanto relieve symptoms\\nsuch as coughing, ulcers of the mouth, kidney dysfunc-\\ntion, urinary tract infection, insomnia, restlessness,geni-\\ntal herpes, and sterility.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nLaboratory studies have shown that anemarrhena\\ncan effectively eradicate infections caused by Staphylo-\\ncoccus aureus, the bacterial strain that often causes lung\\ninfections. Anemarrhena has been effectively used to\\ntreat bronchitis as well as exacerbating symptoms of\\nchronic bronchitis such as chronic coughing.\\nTuberculosis\\nAnemarrhena is also used to treat tuberculosis .\\nHere, however, laboratory results do not support its use.\\nWhen given as 2.5% powder, anemarrhena may slow\\ndown disease progression, but overall it does not reduce\\ndeath rates in laboratory mice. At higher dosage (5%\\npowder), anemarrhena appears to be toxic. More mice\\ntreated with anemarrhena died than in the control group.\\nTherefore, even though the herb can effectively reduce\\nthe low-grade fever associated with tuberculosis, it is a\\npoor substitute for conventional antibiotics, which can\\ncure the disease and prevent death.\\nUrinary tract infections\\nAnemarrhena has been used to treat cystitis, an in-\\nfection of the bladder. Studies have shown that it is ef-\\nfective against Escherichia coli, which commonly causes\\ncystitis in women. Therefore, it may be effective against\\nurinary tract infections caused by this bacterial strain.\\nOther infections\\nThere is little information available concerning the\\nuse of anemarrhena in other types of infections. Howev-\\ner, laboratory studies show that anemarrhena has an-\\ntibacterial activity against Salmonella typhi and Vibrio\\ncholera, the bacteria that cause salmonella food poison-\\ning and cholera, two common infections of the bowels.\\nStudies also show that anemarrhena may also be effec-\\ntive against fungal infections.\\nOliguria\\nAnemarrhena provides moisture to dry internal or-\\ngans. Therefore, it is often used as diuretic to improve\\nkidney function.\\nUlcers of the mouth and/or bleeding gums\\nAnemarrhena can restore moisture in these oral con-\\nditions that exhibit excessive dryness and inflammation.\\nDiabetes\\nBecause Chinese herbalists believe that yin deficien-\\ncy is the underlying cause of diabetes, they often use ane-\\nmarrhena to treat this disease. In fact, there is scientific ev-\\nidence to support its use in the treatment of diabetes. Ani-\\nmal studies show that anemarrhena contains two pharma-\\ncologic agents, mangiferin and mangiferin-7-0-beta\\nglucoside, which appear to increase the effectiveness of\\ninsulin and can lower blood glucose levels.

However, it does not affect glucose levels in nondia-\\nbetic conditions. Anemarrhena may be combined with Shi\\nGao (Gypsum) for additional hypoglycemic effects.\\nChemotherapy and radiation side effects\\nAnemarrhena is often effective in relieving severe\\nadverse reactions associated with conventional\\nchemotherapy and radiation treatments in cancer pa-\\ntients. According to traditional Chinese medicine, x rays\\nused in radiation treatment and drugs used in chemother-\\napy are considered “heat toxins.” These agents are very\\ntoxic so that they can kill tumor cells. But they are also\\ntoxic to the body, causing excessive build-up of heat in-\\nside the Lungs and damaging the Kidneys.\\nMenopausal symptoms\\nAnother use of anemarrhena is to treat menopausal\\nsymptoms such as insomnia, hot flashes, and irregular\\nperiods.\\nHigh blood pressure\\nAnemarrhena is often used in combination with\\nphellodendron and rehmannia to treat high blood pres-\\nsure conditions in patients with symptoms of Liver-fire\\ndeficiency (dizziness , headache , ringing in the ears,\\nback pain, insomnia, palpitations, dry eyes, and night\\nsweat). Recent studies in laboratory animals confirm that\\nthis herb is effective in lowering blood pressure.\\nPreparations\\nThe usual dosage of anamarrhena is 6–12 g per day.\\nIt is available as a single ingredient or in combinations in\\nthe following forms:\\n• Powder or pills. Should be taken with warm water on\\nan empty stomach.\\n• Decoction. A method often used in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine to make an herbal preparation at home. Herbs,\\nusually in combination, are simply boiled down to a con-\\ncentrated broth or tea to be taken internally.\\nPrecautions\\nAnemarrhena should not be used under the follow-\\ning conditions:\\n• watery diarrhea\\n• chronic loose bowel movements\\n• hypotension (low blood pressure). (Anemarrhena at\\nvery high dosages can cause severe drops in blood\\npressure levels)\\nSide effects\\nAnimal studies show that anemarrhena, when ad-\\nministered intravenously at only moderate dosage, can\\ncause breathing difficulty and a decrease in blood pres-\\nsure. High dosages reportedly can cause a severe drop in\\nblood pressure, respiratory arrest, and even death.\\nInteractions\\nAnemarrhena has been known to interact with:\\n• Iron supplements or multivitamin, multimineral sup-\\nplements containing iron. Therefore, patients should\\ntake iron supplements at least two hours before or two\\nhours after the herb.\\n• Iron pots or pans. Patients should not use iron cooking\\nutensils to make decoctions as they may alter the chem-\\nistry of the herb.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBensky, Dan, and Andrew Gamble.

It is caused by a deficiency of\\nfolic acid, a vitamin that the body needs to produce nor-\\nmal cells.\\nFolic acid anemia is especially common in infants\\nand teenagers. Although this condition usually results\\nfrom a dietary deficiency, it is sometimes due to an in-\\nability to absorb enough folic acid from foods such as:\\n• eggs\\n• fish\\n• green vegetables\\n• meat\\n• milk and cheese\\n• mushrooms\\n• yeast\\nSmoking raises the risk of developing this condition\\nby interfering with the absorption of vitamin C, which the\\nbody needs to absorb folic acid. Folic acid anemia can be\\na complication of pregnancy, when a woman’s body\\nneeds eight times more folic acid than it does otherwise.\\nVitamin B12 deficiency anemia\\nLess common in this country than folic acid anemia,\\nvitamin B12 deficiency anemia is another type of mega-\\nloblastic anemia that develops when the body does not\\nThe onset of iron deficiency anemia is gradual. The\\ndeficiency begins when the body loses more iron than it\\ngains from food and other sources. Because depleted\\niron stores cannot meet the red blood cells’ needs, fewer\\nred blood cells develop. In this early stage of anemia, the\\nred blood cells look normal, but they are reduced in\\nnumber. Then the body tries to compensate for the iron\\ndeficiency by producing more red blood cells, which are\\ncharacteristically small in size.\\nWeakness, fatigue, and a run-down feeling may be\\nsigns of mild anemia. Other signs include skin that is\\npasty or sallow, or lack of color in the creases of the\\npalm, gums, nail beds, or lining of the eyelids.

The re-\\nsulting drop in red blood cell production can cause:\\n• loss of muscle control\\n• loss of sensation in the legs, hands, and feet\\n• soreness or burning of the tongue\\n• weight loss\\n• yellow-blue color blindness\\nThe most common form of B 12 deficiency is perni-\\ncious anemia. Since most people who eat meat or eggs\\nget enough B12 in their diets, a deficiency of this vitamin\\nusually means that the body is not absorbing it properly.\\nThis can occur among people who have had intestinal\\nsurgery or those who do not produce adequate amounts\\nof intrinsic factor, a chemical secreted by the stomach\\nlining that combines with B12 to help its absorption in the\\nsmall intestine. Symptoms of pernicious anemia include\\nproblems with movement or balance, a slick tongue, tin-\\ngling in the hands and feet, confusion,depression , and\\nmemory loss. Pernicious anemia can also damage the\\nspinal cord. A doctor should be notified whenever symp-\\ntoms of this condition occur.\\nPernicious anemia usually strikes people 50–60 years\\nof age.

Some\\nacquire this condition, in which infection or antibodies\\ndestroy red blood cells more rapidly than bone marrow\\ncan replace them.\\nHemolytic anemia can enlarge the spleen and accel-\\nerate the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis). Other\\ncomplications of hemolytic anemia may include pain,\\nshock,gallstones, and other serious health problems.\\nThalassemias\\nAn inherited form of hemolytic anemia, thalassemia\\nstems from the body’s inability to manufacture as much\\nnormal hemoglobin as it needs. There are two categories\\nof thalassemia, depending on which of the amino acid\\nchains is affected. (Hemoglobin is composed of four\\nchains of amino acids.) In alpha-thalassemia, there is an\\nimbalance in the production of the alpha chain of amino\\nacids; in beta-thalassemia, there is an imbalance in the\\nbeta chain. Alpha-thalassemias most commonly affect\\nblacks (25% have at least one gene); beta-thalassemias\\nmost commonly affect people of Mediterranean and\\nSoutheast Asian ancestry.\\nCharacterized by production of red blood cells that\\nare unusually small and fragile, thalassemia only affects\\npeople who inherit the gene for it from each parent (au-\\ntosomal recessive inheritance).\\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is the most com-\\nmon type of this disorder. This condition occurs when\\nthe body produces autoantibodies that coat red blood\\ncells. The coated cells are destroyed by the spleen, liver,\\nor bone marrow.\\nWarm antibody hemolytic anemia is more common\\nin women than in men. About one-third of patients who\\nhave warm antibody hemolytic anemia also have lym-\\nphoma,leukemia, lupus, or connective tissue disease.\\nIn cold antibody hemolytic anemia, the body attacks\\nred blood cells at or below normal body temperature.\\nThe acute form of this condition frequently develops in\\npeople who have had pneumonia , mononucleosis ,o r\\nother acute infections . It tends to be mild and short-\\nlived, and disappears without treatment.\\nChronic cold antibody hemolytic anemia is most\\ncommon in women and most often affects those who are\\nover 40 and have arthritis. This condition usually lasts\\nfor a lifetime, generally causing few symptoms. Howev-\\ner, exposure to cold temperatures can accelerate red\\nblood cell destruction, causing fatigue, joint aches, and\\ndiscoloration of the arms and hands.\\nSickle cell anemia\\nSickle cell anemia is a chronic, incurable condition\\nthat causes the body to produce defective hemoglobin,\\nwhich forces red blood cells to assume an abnormal cres-\\ncent shape. Unlike normal oval cells, fragile sickle cells\\ncannot hold enough hemoglobin to nourish body tissues.\\nThe deformed shape makes it hard for sickle cells to pass\\nthrough narrow blood vessels.

X rays and examinations of bone\\nmarrow may be used to identify the source of bleeding.\\nTreatment\\nAnyone who has anemia caused by poor nutrition\\nshould modify his or her diet to include more vitamins,\\nminerals, and iron. Foods such as lean red meats, dried\\nbeans and fruits, liver, poultry, and enriched breads and\\ncereals are all good sources of iron. In addition, eating\\nfoods rich in vitamin C such as citrus fruits and juices\\ncan promote the absorption of iron.\\nPatients diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia\\nshould undergo a thorough physical examination and\\nmedical history to determine the cause of the anemia,\\nparticularly if chronic or acute blood loss is suspected.\\nThe cause of a specific anemia will determine the type of\\ntreatment recommended.\\nAnemia due to nutritional deficiencies can usually\\nbe treated at home with iron supplements or self admin-\\nistered injections of vitamin B12. People with folic acid\\nanemia should take oral folic acid replacements. Vitamin\\nC deficiency anemia can be cured by taking daily sup-\\nplements of vitamin C.\\nMany therapies for iron-deficiency anemia focus on\\nadding iron-rich foods to the diet or on techniques to\\nimprove circulation and digestion. Iron supplementa-\\ntion, especially with iron citrate (less likely to cause\\nconstipation), can be given in combination with herbs\\nthat are rich in iron.

Usually the dried root is used medicinally.\\nThe most common angelica used in Western healing is\\nthe European species,Angelica archangelica. Occasion-\\nally the North American species, A. atropurpurea ,i s\\nused in the same way as A. archangelica . Other names\\nfor Western Angelica are European angelica, garden an-\\ngelica, purple angelica, Alexander’s archangel, master-\\nwort, wild angelica, and wild celery.\\nWestern angelica grows to a height of about 4.5 ft\\n(1.5 m) in dappled sun. It has white to yellow flowers,\\nand very large three-part leaves. The root is long and fi-\\nbrous and is poisonous if used fresh. The plant has a\\nstrong, tangy odor and taste.\\nThere are at least 10 species of angelica used in tra-\\nditional Chinese medicine. The most frequently used\\nspecies is A. sinensis , which in Chinese is called dong\\nquai (alternate spellings are dang gui, tang kwei,and tang\\ngui). Other Chinese species include A. pubescens, called\\nin Chinese du huo, and A. dahurica, called in Chinese bai\\nzhi. The descriptions of the medicinal uses of Chinese an-\\ngelica in this article refer only to A. sinensis or dong quai.\\nChinese angelica is a perennial that grows to a\\nheight of 3 ft (1 m) in moist, fertile soil at high altitudes\\nin China, Korea, and Japan. It has a purple stem and um-\\nbrella-like clusters of flowers. The root is used medici-\\nnally and as a spice.\\nThe species of angelica used in Western healing\\nhave different properties than those used in Eastern med-\\nicine, so they will be treated separately here. The reader\\nshould not assume that any properties or benefits as-\\ncribed to Western angelica also apply to Chinese angeli-\\nca or vice versa.\\nGeneral use\\nWestern angelica\\nWestern angelica, or A. archangelica, is said to have\\nbeen named after an angel who revealed the herb to a Eu-\\nropean monk as a curative. It has a long history of folk use\\nin Europe, Russia, and among Native American tribes.\\nThe leaves of angelica are prepared as a tincture or\\ntea and used to treat coughs, colds, bronchitis, and other\\nrespiratory complaints. They are considered gentler in\\naction than preparations made from the root. The root is\\nthe most medically active part of the plant. It is used as\\nan appetite stimulant and to treat problems of the diges-\\ntive system and liver. It is said to relieve abdominal\\nbloating and gas, indigestion, and heartburn.\\nAngelica will induce sweating and is also used to\\ntreat conditions such as arthritis and rheumatism. In addi-\\ntion, it is used as a diuretic. Externally, angelica is applied\\nas an ointment to treat lice and some skin disorders.\\nIn addition to medicinal use, an essential oil derived\\nfrom the plant is used in making perfumes and as a food\\nflavoring. Oil from the seeds imparts the distinctive fla-\\nvor to the Benedictine liqueur. Sometimes candied leaves\\nand stalks are used as sweets.\\nDespite its widespread folk use, angelica can present\\nsome serious health hazards. The root is poisonous when\\nfresh and must be dried thoroughly before use.

Be-\\ncause angelica is considered to be a warming herb, it is\\nalso used to aid circulation and digestion. Other uses are\\nto treat headache, constipation, rheumatism, high blood\\npressure, and ulcers.\\nDong quai contains several active compounds called\\ncoumarins.

It is sometimes also\\ncharacterized by a feeling of choking, suffocation, or crush-\\ning heaviness. This condition is also called angina pectoris.\\nDescription\\nOften described as a muscle spasm and choking sen-\\nsation, the term angina is used primarily to describe chest\\n(thoracic) pain caused by insufficient oxygen to the heart\\nmuscle. An episode of angina is not an actual heart attack,\\nbut rather pain that results when the heart muscle tem-\\nporarily receives too little blood. This temporary condition\\nmay be the result of demanding activities such as exercise\\nand does not necessarily indicate that the heart muscle is\\nexperiencing permanent damage. In fact, episodes of angi-\\nna seldom cause permanent damage to heart muscle.\\nAngina can be subdivided into two categories: angi-\\nna of effort and variant angina.\\nAngina of effort\\nAngina of effort is a common disorder caused by the\\nnarrowing of the arteries (a condition called atherosclero-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 286\\nAngina\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDecoction —Decoctions are made by boiling an\\nherb, then straining the solid material out for the\\nresulting liquid.\\nDiuretic—A diuretic is any substance that increas-\\nes the production of urine.\\nTincture—An alcohol-based extract prepared by\\nsoaking plant parts.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 86'),\n",

In\\nthe case of angina of effort, the coronary arteries can pro-\\nvide the heart muscle (myocardium) adequate blood dur-\\ning rest but not during periods of exercise,stress, or ex-\\ncitement. The resulting pain is relieved by resting or by\\nadministering nitroglycerin, a medication that relaxes the\\nheart muscle, opens up the coronary blood vessels, and\\nlowers the blood pressure—all of which reduce the heart’s\\nneed for oxygen. Patients with angina of effort have an in-\\ncreased risk of heart attack (myocardial infarction).\\nV ariant angina\\nVariant angina is uncommon and occurs indepen-\\ndently of atherosclerosis, which may incidentally be pre-\\nsent. Variant angina occurs at rest and is not related to\\nexcessive work by the heart muscle. Research indicates\\nthat variant angina is caused by coronary artery muscle\\nspasm that does not last long enough or is not intense\\nenough to cause an actual heart attack.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAngina is usually caused by an underlying obstruc-\\ntion to the coronary artery due to atherosclerosis. In\\nsome cases, it is caused by spasm that occurs naturally or\\nas a result of ingesting cocaine. In rare cases, angina is\\ncaused by a coronary embolism or by a disease other\\nthan atherosclerosis that places demands on the heart.\\nMost episodes of angina are brought on by physical\\nexertion, when the heart needs more oxygen than is\\navailable from the blood nourishing the heart. Emotional\\nstress, extreme temperatures, heavy meals, cigarette\\nsmoking, and alcohol can also cause or contribute to an\\nepisode of angina.\\nAngina causes a pressing pain or sensation of heavi-\\nness, usually in the chest area under the breast bone\\n(sternum). It is occasionally experienced in the shoulder,\\narm, neck, or jaw regions. In most cases, the symptoms\\nare relieved within a few minutes by resting or by taking\\nprescribed angina medications.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians can usually diagnose angina based on the\\npatient’s symptoms and the precipitating factors. Howev-\\ner, other diagnostic testing is often required to confirm or\\nrule out angina, or to determine the severity of the under-\\nlying heart disease.\\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\\nAn electrocardiogram is a test that records electrical\\nimpulses from the heart. The resulting graph of electrical\\nactivity can show if the heart muscle isn’t functioning\\nproperly as a result of a lack of oxygen. Electrocardio-\\ngrams are also useful in investigating other possible ab-\\nnormal features of the heart, such as arrhythmia (irregu-\\nlar heartbeat).\\nStress test\\nFor many individuals with angina, the results of an\\nelectrocardiogram while at rest will not show any abnor-\\nmalities. Because the symptoms of angina occur during\\nstress, the heart’s function may need to be evaluated\\nunder the physical stress of exercise. The stress test\\nrecords information from the electrocardiogram before,\\nduring, and after exercise in search of stress-related ab-\\nnormalities. Blood pressure is also measured during the\\nstress test and symptoms are noted. In some cases a more\\ninvolved and complex stress test (for example, thallium\\nscanning) is used to picture the blood flow in the heart\\nmuscle during the most intense exercise and after rest.\\nAngiogram\\nThe angiogram, which is a series of x rays of the\\ncoronary artery, has been noted as the most accurate diag-\\nnostic test to indicate the presence and extent of coronary\\ndisease. In this procedure, a long, thin, flexible tube\\n(catheter) is inserted into an artery located in the forearm\\nor groin. This catheter is passed further through the artery\\ninto one of the two major coronary arteries. A dye is in-\\njected through the catheter to make the heart, arteries, and\\nblood flow clearer on the x ray. A fluoroscopic film, or\\nseries of “moving” x rays, shows the blood flowing\\nthrough the coronary arteries. This will reveal any possi-\\nble narrowing that can cause a decrease in blood flow to\\nthe heart muscle and associated symptoms of angina.\\nTreatment\\nControlling existing factors that place the individual at\\nrisk is the first step in addressing artery disease that causes\\nangina. These risk factors include cigarette smoking, high\\nblood pressure, high cholesterollevels, and obesity.\\nOnce the angina has subsided, the cause should be\\ndetermined and treated. Atherosclerosis, a major associ-\\nated cause, requires diet and lifestyle adjustments, pri-\\nmarily including regular exercise, reduction of dietary\\nsugar and saturated fats, and increase of dietary fiber.\\nIn recent years, several specific cholesterol-lowering\\ntreatments have gained the attention and interest of the\\npublic. One of the most recent popular treatments is garlic\\n(Allium sativum). Some studies have shown that garlic can\\nreduce total cholesterol by about 10% and LDL (bad) cho-\\nlesterol by 15%, and can raise HDL (good) cholesterol by\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 87\\nAngina\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 87'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 104}, page_content='10%. Other studies have not shown significant benefit. Al-\\nthough its effect on cholesterol is not as great as the effect\\nachieved by medications, garlic may help in relatively\\nmild cases of high cholesterol, without causing the side ef-\\nfects associated with cholesterol-reducing drugs.\\nA 1999 study published in the American Journal of\\nClinical Nutrition found that red yeast extract can signifi-\\ncantly reduce cholesterol when it’s taken in conjunction\\nwith a low-fat diet. Red yeast extract, available in the Unit-\\ned States under the trade name Cholestin, has been used in\\nChinese medicine to treat heart maladies for hundreds of\\nyears. The effectiveness of the extract depends on the pa-\\ntient’s cholesterol level and medical history, so individuals\\nshould consult with their healthcare professionals before\\ntaking the supplement. Additional herbal remedies that\\nmay help lower cholesterol include oats (Avena sativa), al-\\nfalfa (Medicago sativa), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-\\ngraecum), Korean ginseng (Panax ginseng ), myrrh\\n(Commiphora molmol), and turmeric(Curcuma longa).\\nYarrow (Achillea millefolium ), linden ( Tilia eu-\\nropaea), and hawthorn (Crataegus spp.) are sometimes\\nrecommended for controlling high blood pressure, a risk\\nfactor for heart disease. In particular, hawthorn extract\\nappears to benefit the aging heart. A 2001 report of a Eu-\\nropean study reported that patients using hawthorn ex-\\ntract showed improvements in exercise tolerance,fa-\\ntigue, and shortness of breath.\\nTea (Camellia sinensis )—especially green tea—is\\nhigh in antioxidants, and studies have shown that it may\\nhelp prevent atherosclerosis. Other antioxidants, includ-\\ning vitamin A (beta carotene ), vitamin C , vitamin E ,\\nand selenium, can also limit the damage to the walls of\\nblood vessels by oxidation, which may be lead to the for-\\nmation of atherosclerotic plaque.\\nVitamin and mineral supplements that reduce, re-\\nverse, or protect against coronary artery disease include\\nchromium, calcium and magnesium , B-complex vita-\\nmins, L-carnitine, and zinc. Yoga and other bodywork,\\nmassage, aromatherapy , and music therapy may also\\nhelp reduce angina symptoms by promoting relaxation\\nand stress reduction.\\nTraditional Chinese medicine may recommend\\nherbal remedies (such as a ginseng and aconite combina-\\ntion), massage, acupuncture, and dietary modification.\\nExercise and a healthy diet, including cold-water fish as a\\nsource of essential fatty acids, are important components\\nof a regimen to prevent angina and heart disease.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAngina is often controlled by medication, most\\ncommonly with nitroglycerin. This drug relieves symp-\\ntoms of angina by increasing the diameter of the blood\\nvessels that carry blood to the heart muscle. Nitroglyc-\\nerin is taken whenever discomfort occurs or is expected.\\nIt may be taken sublingually, by placing the tablet under\\nthe tongue. Or it may be administered transdermally, by\\nplacing a medicated patch directly on the skin.\\nIn addition, beta-blockers or calcium channel block-\\ners may be prescribed to decrease the heart’s rate and\\nworkload. In late 2001, a study reported that the drug\\nNicorandil had become the first to demonstrate a reduc-\\ntion in risk of angina and to improve symptoms in patients\\nwith chronic stable angina. Guidelines released late in\\n2000 promoted use of lopidogrel to help prevent recurring\\nevents. A study group that used clopidogrel and aspirin\\nshowed a significant decrease in cardiovascular death,\\nnonfatal heart attack, and stroke compared to patients in a\\ncontrol group that received a placebo and aspirin.\\nWhen conservative treatments are not effective in\\nreducing angina pain and the risk of heart attack remains\\nhigh, physicians may recommend angioplasty or surgery.\\nIn coronary artery bypass surgery, a blood vessel (often a\\nlong vein surgically removed from the leg) is grafted\\nonto the blocked artery to bypass the blocked portion.\\nThis newly formed pathway allows blood to flow ade-\\nquately to the heart muscle.\\nAnother procedure used to improve blood flow to\\nthe heart is percutaneous tranluminal coronary angio-\\nplasty, usually called coronary or balloon angioplasty. In\\nthis procedure, the physician inserts a catheter with a\\ntiny balloon at the end into a forearm or groin artery. The\\ncatheter is then threaded up into the coronary arteries,\\nand the balloon is inflated to open the vessel in narrowed\\nsections. Other techniques to open clogged arteries are\\nunder development and in limited use, including the use\\nof lasers, stents, and other surgical devices.\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis for a patient with angina depends on\\nthe general health of the individual as well as on the ori-\\ngin, type, and severity of the condition. A person can im-\\nprove his or her prognosis by seeking prompt medical at-\\ntention and learning the pattern of his or her angina, such\\nas what causes the attacks, what they feel like, how long\\nepisodes usually last, and whether medication relieves\\nthe attacks.

It is related to other plants prized for their aromatic\\nfruits, commonly called seeds, such as dill, cumin, car-\\naway, and fennel. It is cultivated chiefly for its licorice-\\nflavored fruits, called aniseed. Although it has a licorice\\nflavor, anise is not related to the European plant whose\\nroots are the source of true licorice. It has been used as a\\nmedicinal and fragrant plant since ancient times.\\nThe plant reaches from 1–3 ft (0.3–1 m) in height\\nwhen cultivated, and has finely divided feather-like\\nbright green leaflets. The name Pimpinella (from the\\nLatin dipinella ) refers to the pinnately divided form of\\nthe leaves. The plant bears white to yellowish-white\\nflowers in compound umbels (umbrella-like clusters).\\nWhen ripe, the fruits are 0.125 in (3 mm) long and oval-\\nshaped with grayish-green coloring.\\nWhile the entire plant is fragrant and tastes strongly\\nof anise, it is the aniseed fruit that has been highly val-\\nued since antiquity. Seed maturation usually occurs one\\nmonth after pollination, when the oil content in the dried\\nfruit is about 2.5%. Steam distillation of the crushed\\naniseed yields from 2.5 to 3.5% of a fragrant, syrupy, es-\\nsential, or volatile, oil, of which anethole, present at\\nabout 90%, is the principal aromatic constituent. Other\\nchemical constituents of the fruit are creosol, alpha-\\npinene, dianethole, and photoanethole.\\nIn addition to its medicinal properties, anise is wide-\\nly used for flavoring curries, breads, soups, cakes, can-\\ndies, desserts, nonalcoholic beverages, and liqueurs such\\nas anisette. The essential oil is valuable in perfumes and\\nsoaps and has been used in toothpastes, mouthwashes,\\nand skin creams.\\nAnise is endemic to the Middle East and Mediter-\\nranean regions, including Egypt, Greece, Crete, and Turkey.\\nIt was cultivated and used by ancient Egyptians, and used in\\nancient Greece and Rome, when it was cultivated in Tus-\\ncany. Its use and cultivation spread to central Europe in the\\nMiddle Ages, and today it is cultivated on a commercial\\nscale in warm areas such as southern Europe, Asia, India,\\nNorth Africa, Mexico, and Central and South America.\\nGeneral use\\nThe medicinal properties of anise come from the\\nchemicals that are present in the fruits. The anethole in\\nhealthy lifestyle includes eating right, exercising regularly,\\nmaintaining an appropriate weight, not smoking, drinking\\nin moderation, controlling hypertension, and managing\\nstress. Most healthcare professionals can provide valuable\\nadvice on proper diet, weight control, smoking cessation,\\nblood cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Heart Association. 2000 Heart and Stroke Statistical\\nUpdate.

McDade\\nTeresa G. Odle\\nAnkylosing spondylitis\\nDefinition\\nAnkylosing spondylitis (AS) is a systemic disorder that\\nrefers to inflammation of the joints in the spine. AS is the\\nprimary disease in an entire group of conditions known as\\nseronegative spondylarthropathies.It is also known as\\nrheumatoid spondylitis or Marie–Strümpell disease (among\\nother names). AS is an autoimmune disease, as are most\\nforms of arthritis. By definition, other joints, in addition to\\nthe spine, can also be affected, including the shoulders,\\nhips, knees, and feet. Tissues in the eye can also be affected.\\nDescription\\nA form of arthritis, AS is characterized by chronic\\ninflammation, causing pain and stiffness of the back,\\nprogressing to the chest and neck. Eventually, the whole\\nback may become curved and inflexible if the bones\\nfuse, which is known as “bamboo spine.” Other condi-\\ntions associated with AS include reactive arthritis, psori-\\natic arthritis, spondylitis of inflammatory bowel dis-\\nease, and undifferentiated spondyarthropathy. AS may\\ninvolve multiple organs, such as the:\\n• eye (causing an inflammation of the iris, or iritis)\\n• heart (causing aortic valve disease)\\n• lungs\\n• skin (causing a scaly skin condition, or psoriasis)\\n• gastrointestinal tract (causing inflammation within the\\nsmall intestine, called ileitis, or inflammation of the\\nlarge intestine, called colitis).\\nLess than 1% of the population has AS; however,\\n20% of AS sufferers have a relative with the disorder.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nGenetics, in the form of a gene named HLA–B27,\\ncan play an important role in the disease, but the precise\\ncause of AS remains unknown. According to information\\nfrom the Spondylitis Association of America, HLA–B27\\nis a perfectly normal gene found in 8% of the general\\npopulation. Generally speaking, no more than 2% of\\npeople born with this gene will eventually get spondyli-\\ntis. The gene itself does not cause spondylitis, but people\\nwith HLA–B27 are more susceptible to getting spondyli-\\ntis. To date, 15 subtypes of HLA–B27 have been identi-\\nfied. The most common subtypes in the United States\\nbeing B27.05, and then after that B27.02. The way in\\nwhich HLA–B27 interacts with some other proteins\\nseems to be very important to the cause of AS, but fur-\\nther research must be conducted to find out exactly how.\\nAccording to information published in 1997 from The\\nArthritis Cure, by Dr. Jason Theodosakis, M.D., M.S.,\\nM. P. H., and others, research was being conducted re-\\ngarding the possibility that a certain type of infection\\ncould be the trigger for the onset of AS.\\nSymptoms of AS include:\\n• low back and hip pain and stiffness\\n• duration of symptoms longer than three months\\n• difficulty expanding the chest\\n• early morning stiffness improved by a warm shower or\\nlight exercise\\n• pain in the neck, shoulders, knees, and ankles\\n• low-grade fever\\n• fatigue\\n• weight loss\\nAS occurs most often in males between 16 and 35\\nyears of age. Initial symptoms are uncommon after the\\nage of 30, although the diagnosis may not be established\\nuntil after that age. The incidence of AS in African\\nAmericans is about 25% of incidence among Cau-\\ncasians, but is rarely seen in that population.\\nSome naturopathic healers link the cause of AS to\\nits autoimmune origins in food allergies and abnormal\\nbowel function, sometimes referred to as “leaky gut”\\nsyndrome. According to this theory, food allergies com-\\nbine with the leaky gut and, according to the Healing-\\nWithNutrition website, from a 1986 article in the Britain\\nJournal of Rheumatology, “..result in the increased circu-\\nlation of gut-derived antigens into other areas of the\\nbody. The body produces antibody-antigen complexes\\n(immune complexes) characteristic of RA (rheumatoid\\narthritis ) to battle these gut-derived foreign antigens;\\nbut these antibody-antigens are thought to also cross-\\nreact with antigens in the joint tissues. In other words,\\nthe antibodies formed to attack the (leaky gut) microbes\\nalso cross-react and attack joint collagen.”\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 292\\nAnkylosing spondylitis\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 92'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 109}, page_content='Diagnosis\\nDoctors usually diagnose the disease simply by the\\npatient’s report of pain and stiffness. Doctors also review\\nspinal and pelvic x rays since involvement of the hip and\\npelvic joints is common and may be the first abnormality\\nseen on the x ray. The doctor might also order a blood\\ntest to determine the presence of HLA–B27 antigen if\\nthe x rays have not clearly determined the diagnosis. If\\nthe gene is present, it could facilitate the accuracy of the\\npossible AS diagnosis. When a diagnosis is made, pa-\\ntients may be referred to a rheumatologist, a doctor who\\nspecializes in treating arthritis. Patients may also be re-\\nferred to an orthopedic surgeon, a doctor who can surgi-\\ncally correct joint or bone disorders.\\nTreatment\\nTo reduce inflammation, various herbal remedies,\\nincluding white willow (Salix alba ), yarrow (Achillea\\nmillefolium), and lobelia (Lobelia inflata), may be help-\\nful. Acupuncture, performed by a trained professional,\\nhas helped some patients manage their pain. Homeopath-\\nic practitioners may prescribe such remedies as Bryonia\\nand Rhus toxicodendron for pain relief.\\nA key alternative treatment for AS is massage ther-\\napy. Reported benefits include a decrease in pain, in-\\ncrease in circulation, lymph flow improvement, and in-\\ncrease in range of motion. The major benefit of this ther-\\napy could be that it provides further motivation for a reg-\\nular excerise program, considered the most beneficial of\\nall treatments for AS.\\nDiets of various regimens have been offered that in-\\nclude supplements of fatty acids and antioxidants ,a s\\nwith other arthritis diets. Naturopaths and some medical\\ndoctors have theorized that certain foods should be elim-\\ninated from the diet in order to alleviate symptoms. Pos-\\nsible problem foods include wheat, corn, milk and other\\ndairy products, beef, tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers.\\nTobacco has also been thought to aggravate the condi-\\ntion. Various reports have surfaced in many books and\\narticles that indicate a diet high in fiber and fresh fruits\\nand vegetables—minus those listed above—and low in\\nsugar, meat, refined carbohydrates, and animal fats\\nmight help in the treatment of the symptoms, particularly\\nwith pain or swelling.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),\\nlike naproxen (Naprosyn) or indomethacin (Indocin) are\\nused to relieve pain and stiffness. In severe cases, sul-\\nfasalazine (Azulfidine), another drug to reduce inflam-\\nmation, or methotrexate (Rheumatrex), an immune-sup-\\npressing drug, are recommended. In cases where chronic\\ntherapy is needed, potential drug side effects must be\\ntaken into consideration. Corticosteroid drugs are effec-\\ntive in relieving symptoms, but are usually reserved for\\nsevere cases that do not improve when NSAIDs are used.\\nTo avoid potential side effects, treatment with corticos-\\nteroids is usually limited to a short amount of time with a\\ngradual weaning from the drug.\\nIn April 2002, a study published revealed that a drug\\nalready approved for patients with rheumatoid arthritis\\nwas successful in helping most AS patients as well. In-\\nfliximab helped alleviate pain and improved functioning\\nin more than 80 % of patients in a clinical trial. The drug\\nworked rapidly and reduced disease activity by more\\nthan half in about 50% of patients. Some serious side ef-\\nfects did occur, so researchers continued to test the drug\\nand seek Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval\\nfor Infliximab for AS patients. In the same year, scien-\\ntists were testing another drug called Etanercept that also\\nshowed promising results in preliminary trials.\\nPhysical therapists prescribe exercises to prevent a\\nstooped posture and breathing problems when the spine\\nstarts to fuse and ribs are affected. Back braces may be\\nused to prevent continued deformity of the spine and\\nribs. Only in severe cases of deformity is surgery per-\\nformed to straighten and realign the spine, or to replace\\nknee, shoulder, or hip joints. Because it is a major and\\ncomplicated procedure, with a potential for complica-\\ntions, this surgery is recommended cautiously even in se-\\nvere cases.\\nExpected results\\nThere is no cure for AS, and the course of the dis-\\nease is unpredictable. Generally, AS progresses for about\\n10 years, then levels off. Most patients can lead normal\\nlives with treatment to control symptoms. Claims that\\nhomeopathic remedies have cured them have not been\\nverified.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no known way to prevent AS.

Odle\\nAnorexia nervosa\\nDefinition\\nAnorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized\\nby unrealistic fear of weight gain, self-starvation, and\\nconspicuous distortion of body image. The name comes\\nfrom two Latin words that mean “nervous inability to\\neat.” In females who have begun to menstruate, anorexia\\nnervosa is usually marked by amenorrhea, or skipping at\\nleast three menstrual periods in a row. The fourth edition\\nof the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Dis-\\norders, or DSM-IV (1994), defines two subtypes of\\nanorexia nervosa—a restricting type, characterized by\\nstrict dieting and exercise without binge eating—and a\\nbinge-eating/purging type, marked by episodes of com-\\npulsive eating with or without self-induced vomiting and\\nthe use of laxatives or enemas. DSM-IV defines a binge\\nas a time-limited (usually under two hours) episode of\\ncompulsive eating in which the individual consumes a\\nsignificantly larger amount of food than most people\\nwould eat in similar circumstances.\\nDescription\\nAnorexia nervosa was not officially classified as a\\npsychiatric disorder until the third edition of DSM in\\n1980. It is, however, a growing problem among adoles-\\ncent females and its incidence in the United States has\\ndoubled since 1970. The rise in the number of reported\\ncases reflects a genuine increase in the number of per-\\nsons affected by the disorder, not simply earlier or more\\naccurate diagnosis. Estimates of the incidence of anorex-\\nia range between 0.5-1% of Caucasian female adoles-\\ncents. Over 90% of patients diagnosed with the disorder\\nas of 1998 were female. It was originally thought that\\nonly 5% of anorexics are male, but that estimate is being\\nrevised upward. The peak age range for onset of the dis-\\norder is 14-18 years, although there are patients who de-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 294\\nAnorexia nervosa\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAnkylosing —When bones of a joint are fused,\\nstiff, or rigid.\\nHLA–B27—An antigen or protein marker on cells\\nthat may indicate ankylosing spondylitis.\\nImmune suppressing —Anything that reduces the\\nactivity of the immune system.\\nInflammation—A reaction of tissues to disease or\\ninjury, often associated with pain and swelling.\\nSpondylitis—An inflammation of the spine.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 94'),\n",

In the 1970s and\\n1980s, anorexia was regarded as a disorder of upper- and\\nmiddle-class women, but that generalization is also\\nchanging. More recent studies indicate that anorexia is\\nincreasingly common among women of all races and so-\\ncial classes in the United States.\\nAnorexia nervosa is a serious public health problem\\nnot only because of its rising incidence, but also because\\nit has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychi-\\natric disorder. Moreover, the disorder may cause serious\\nlong-term health complications, including congestive\\nheart failure, sudden death, growth retardation, dental\\nproblems,constipation, stomach rupture, swelling of the\\nsalivary glands, loss of kidney function, osteoporosis ,\\nanemia and other abnormalities of the blood.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAnorexia is a disorder that results from the interac-\\ntion of cultural and interpersonal as well as biological\\nfactors. While the precise cause of the disease is not\\nknown, it has been linked to the following:\\nSocial influences\\nThe rising incidence of anorexia is thought to reflect\\nthe present idealization of thinness as a badge of upper-\\nclass status as well as of female beauty. In addition, the\\nincrease in cases of anorexia includes “copycat” behav-\\nior, with some patients developing the disorder from imi-\\ntating other girls.\\nThe onset of anorexia in adolescence is attributed to\\na developmental crisis caused by girls’ changing bodies\\ncoupled with society’s overemphasis on women’s looks.\\nThe increasing influence of the mass media in spreading\\nand reinforcing gender stereotypes has also been noted.\\nOccupational goals\\nThe risk of developing anorexia is higher among\\nadolescents preparing for careers that require attention to\\nweight and/or appearance. These high-risk groups in-\\nclude dancers, fashion models, professional athletes (in-\\ncluding gymnasts, skaters, long-distance runners, and\\njockeys), and actresses.\\nGenetic and biological influences\\nWomen whose biological mothers or sisters have the\\ndisorder appear to be at increased risk.\\nPsychological factors\\nA number of theories have been advanced to explain\\nthe psychological aspects of the disorder. No single ex-\\nplanation covers all cases. Anorexia nervosa has been in-\\nterpreted as:\\n• A rejection of female sexual maturity. This rejection is\\nvariously interpreted as a desire to remain a child, or as\\na desire to resemble men as closely as possible.\\n• A reaction to sexual abuse or assault.\\n• A desire to appear as fragile and non-threatening as\\npossible. This hypothesis reflects the idea that female\\npassivity and weakness are attractive to men.\\n• Overemphasis on control, autonomy, and independence.\\nSome anorexics come from achievement-oriented fami-\\nlies that stress physical fitness and dieting. Many\\nanorexics are perfectionists and “driven” about school-\\nwork and other matters in addition to weight control.\\n• Evidence of family dysfunction. In some families, a\\ndaughter’s eating disorder serves as a distraction from\\nmarital discord or other family tensions.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 95'),\n",

Less is known about the caus-\\nes of anorexia in males, but some risk factors are the\\nsame as for females. These include certain occupational\\ngoals and increasing media emphasis on external appear-\\nance in men. Moreover, homosexual males are under\\npressure to conform to an ideal body weight that is about\\n20 pounds lighter than the standard “attractive” weight\\nfor heterosexual males.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of anorexia nervosa is complicated by a\\nnumber of factors. One is that the disorder varies some-\\nwhat in severity from patient to patient. A second factor\\nis denial, which is regarded as an early sign of the disor-\\nder. Most anorexics deny that they are ill and are usually\\nbrought to treatment by a family member.\\nAnorexia is usually diagnosed by pediatricians or\\nfamily practitioners. Anorexics develop emaciated bod-\\nies, dry or yellowish skin, and abnormally low blood\\npressure. There is usually a history of amenorrhea (failure\\nto menstruate) in females, and sometimes of abdominal\\npain, constipation, or lack of energy. The patient may\\nfeel chilly or have developed lanugo, a growth of downy\\nbody hair. If the patient has been vomiting, she may have\\neroded tooth enamel or Russell’s sign (scars on the back\\nof the hand). The second step in diagnosis is measure-\\nment of the patient’s weight loss. DSM-IV specifies a\\nweight loss leading to a body weight 15% below normal,\\nwith some allowance for body build and weight history.\\nThe doctor will rule out other physical conditions\\nthat can cause weight loss or vomiting after eating, in-\\ncluding metabolic disorders, brain tumors (especially hy-\\npothalamus and pituitary gland lesions), diseases of the\\ndigestive tract, and a condition called superior mesen-\\nteric artery syndrome. Persons with this condition some-\\ntimes vomit after meals because the blood supply to the\\nintestine is blocked. The doctor will usually order blood\\ntests, an electrocardiogram, urinalysis, and bone densito-\\nmetry (bone density test) in order to exclude other dis-\\neases and to assess the patient’s nutritional status.\\nThe doctor will also need to distinguish between\\nanorexia and other psychiatric disorders, including de-\\npression, schizophrenia, social phobia, obsessive-com-\\npulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Two di-\\nagnostic tests that are often used are the Eating Attitudes\\nTest (EAT) and the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI).\\nTreatment\\nAlternative treatments should serve as complemen-\\ntary to a conventional treatment program. Alternative\\ntherapies for anorexia nervosa include diet and\\nnutrition, herbal therapy, hydrotherapy, aromathera-\\npy, Ayurveda, and mind/body medicine.\\nNutritional therapy\\nA naturopath or nutritionist may recommend the fol-\\nlowing:\\n• avoiding sweets or baked goods\\n• following a nutritious and well-balanced diet (when pa-\\ntients resume eating normally)\\n• gaily multivitamin and mineral supplements\\n• zinc supplements. (Zinc is an important mineral needed\\nby the body for normal hormonal activity and enzymat-\\nic function)\\nHerbal therapy\\nThe following herbs may help reduce anxiety and\\ndepression which are often associated with this disorder:\\n• chamomile (Matricaria recutita)\\n• lemon balm (Melissa officinalis)\\n• linden (Tilia spp.) flowers\\nAromatherapy\\nEssential oils of herbs such as bergamot, basil,\\nchamomile, clary sage and lavendermay help stimulate ap-\\npetite, relax the body and fight depression.

Steiner, from Austria, be-\\nlieved that everyone has spiritual powers that can be acti-\\nvated by exercises in mental concentration and\\nmeditation. During his lifetime, he was an active teacher,\\nattracting many followers to his spiritual ideas. Steiner\\nfounded several schools, wrote nearly 30 books, and gave\\nmore than 6,000 lectures around the world on subjects in-\\ncluding education, medicine, agriculture, social issues, sci-\\nence and art. His ideas have remained influential. The Wal-\\ndorf school system, which he began, educates thousands of\\nyoung people each year. Many health food stores carry\\nproducts produced by Steiner’s system of agriculture called\\nbiodynamic farming, which considers the health and purity\\nof the soil, water, and air to be of central importance.\\nAnthroposophical medicine is based on Steiner’s\\nconcept that spiritual awareness is the foundation of in-\\ndividual health and of the health of society. Steiner be-\\nlieved that many of the oldest systems of healing, such as\\ntraditional Chinese medicine, Ayurvedic medicine ,\\nand Tibetan medicine, were based on a spiritual percep-\\ntion of the world that modern science has lost. Steiner\\nwanted medicine to get back in touch with spirituality,\\nand at the same time keep and use wisely the gains that\\nscience and technology have made. Thus, conventional\\nmedicine needed to be extended beyond physical science\\nto include a holistic spiritual science.\\nSteiner formally began application of his philosophy\\nin a series of 20 lectures in the early spring of 1920 to\\nthe medical community of a town in Switzerland. It was\\nthe first such course for physicians and medical students.\\nHe and Dutch medical doctor Ita Wegman co-authored a\\nfoundational work for physicians wanting to expand\\ntheir practice according to anthroposophic principles.\\nAnthroposophical medicine is still in its early stages.\\nSteiner believed that it would take many years for his med-\\nical ideas to be fully applied. There are thousands of anthro-\\nposophical doctors and researchers practicing in Europe,\\nwhere the main school was founded. In America, practition-\\ners can be found in several large cities, but the overall num-\\nber of anthroposophical physicians is very small.\\nBenefits\\nAnthroposophical medicine can be used to treat any\\nhealth condition. It is particularly recommended for pre-\\nventive care,infections , inflammatory conditions such\\nas arthritis, and the treatment of cancer and chronic de-\\ngenerative diseases associated with aging. It is also rec-\\nommended for pediatric (child) care, with its avoidance\\nof toxic drugs, and is beneficial for children’s conditions\\nsuch as attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n(ADHD) and developmental problems.\\nDescription\\nThe anthroposophical concept of the body\\nAnthroposophical physicians have a different view\\nof the body and health than the conventional scientific\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 298\\nAnthroposophical medicine\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 98'),\n",

The first level is the physical body.\\nThe second level is the life or etheric body, which corre-\\nsponds to the Chinese idea of chi and the Ayurvedic idea\\nof prana. The third level is the soul, or astral body, and\\nthe fourth level is the spirit. AM doctors believe that all\\nlevels of being influence a patient’s health.\\nThe physical body is made up of a three-fold sys-\\ntem, including the “sense-nerve” system that comprises\\nthe head and nervous system, supporting the mind and\\nthe thinking process. Second is the “metabolic-limb”\\nsystem that includes the digestive system for elimina-\\ntion, energetic metabolism, and voluntary movement\\nprocesses, all supporting aspects of human behavior that\\nexpress the will. Finally, the rhythmic system that in-\\ncludes the heart and lungs in the chest, is responsible for\\nbalancing the head and digestive systems. According to\\nAM, these systems tend to oppose each other in func-\\ntioning and characteristics, similar to the Chinese con-\\ncept of yin and yang. For instance, the digestive system\\nis associated with heat and helps to dissolve elements in\\nthe body, while the head system is associated with cool-\\ning and helps in the formation of elements in the body.\\nIllness is caused when the systems of the body become\\nout of balance. AM involves a broad understanding of\\nthe three bodily systems, and the illnesses associated\\nwith each system and its imbalance. This model provides\\npractitioners a means for therapeutic insight now recog-\\nnized as mind-body relationships in health and disease.\\nIn anthroposophical medicine, illness is considered a\\nsignificant event in a person’s life, and not just a chance\\noccurrence. One role of the doctor is to understand, and\\nhelp the patient understand, the significance of the illness\\non all levels of being. Conventional medicine tends to\\nsuppress illness, using drugs to block the symptoms. AM\\ndoctors believe that true healing must first bring an illness\\nout in order to heal it, and that healing requires change\\nand development in the patient on several levels.\\nAM also asserts, as did the early healer Paracelsus,\\nthat every illness has a cure that can be found in nature.\\nParacelsus is the pseudonym for a Swiss-born alchemist\\nand physician who lived from 1493–1541. Nature and\\nthe human body are made up of the plant, animal, and\\nmineral kingdoms, and thus AM doctors use medicines\\nthat are made from plants, animals (usually in the form\\nof organ extracts), and minerals. AM remedies are usual-\\nly given in homeopathic doses, which are very diluted,\\nnon-toxic solutions.\\nTreatment by an anthroposophical physician\\nAll anthroposophical physicians are conventionally\\ntrained M.D.s, as Steiner believed that conventional train-\\ning was a necessary first step. However, a visit to an an-\\nthroposophical physician may be different than a visit to a\\nregular doctor. Anthroposophical doctors, first of all, tend\\nto spend much more time with their patients, particularly\\nduring the initial visit. Every patient is considered unique,\\nand AM doctors use the first visit to get a broad under-\\nstanding of patients and their medical histories. To diag-\\nnose illnesses, AM doctors may use modern diagnostic\\ntools, but also rely on intuition and an understanding of the\\npatient. Part of training of AM doctors involves improving\\ntheir powers of perception in order to understand illnesses.\\nDiagnosis is considered a very important process; Steiner\\nbelieved that if the diagnosis of a problem is done correct-\\nly, then the therapeutic (healing) work is much easier. After\\na problem is thoroughly diagnosed, treatment will be rec-\\nommended. AM doctors attempt to treat a patient on all\\nfour levels of being. For the physical body, remedies will\\nbe prescribed. There are hundreds of uniquely formulated\\nmedications, similar to homeopathies, as well as botanical\\nmedicines. AM doctors try to minimize the use of antibi-\\notics, drugs, and vaccinations.\\nAnthroposophical medicine also uses allied thera-\\npies, which are additional therapies that Steiner recom-\\nmended to heal patients on other levels than the physical.\\nThese include massage therapy and a movement thera-\\npy called eurythmy. Eurythmy is a system of movements\\ndesigned to help patients give expression to inner spiritu-\\nal movements. Psychotherapy may also be recommend-\\ned to help heal some conditions. AM doctors may apply\\nallied therapies themselves, or refer patients to other\\nhealers. The length of treatment with AM depends on the\\npatient and condition. The cost of treatment varies with\\nthe practitioner, and is comparable to treatment by con-\\nventional M.D.s. AM medications are less expensive\\nthan conventional drugs. Because AM practitioners are\\ntrained medical doctors, insurance policies often cover\\ntheir fees, although consumers should be aware of their\\npolicy restrictions.\\nPreparations\\nAM doctors may give new patients packages of ma-\\nterials before treatment, which include thorough ques-\\ntionnaires and explanations of AM. Anthroposophical\\nphysicians encourage patients to prepare for treatment\\nby becoming willing to take responsibility for their con-\\ndition and health, and to change their behaviors and\\nlifestyles in the interest of healing.\\nSide effects\\nAM medications are safe and non-toxic. During\\ntreatment, some patients may experience what doctors\\ncall “healing crises.” During these, patients may tem-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 99\\nAnthroposophical medicine\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 99'),\n",

Several research organizations performing patient-\\ncentered research have shown promising results with the\\nAM cure for cancer, which utilizes the herbal remedy\\nmistletoeextract, and for other conditions. Other research\\nhas shown that AM is less expensive than conventional\\nmedical treatment, with 50% fewer illness days than when\\ntreated by conventional practitioners. Current research\\nstudies appear in the quarterly Journal of Anthroposophi-\\ncal Medicine, as well as in European publications.\\nTraining & certification\\nCurrently, there is no course for the certification of\\nAM practitioners, although every AM doctor is required\\nto obtain training as a certified M.D. Afterwards, physi-\\ncians may specialize in AM by taking a series of courses\\nor by interning with specialists.

They are essential to good health and\\nare found naturally in a wide variety of foods and plants,\\nincluding many fruits and vegetables. Many antioxi-\\ndants, either singly or in combination, are also available\\nas over-the-counter nutritional supplements in tablet or\\ncapsule form. The most commonly used antioxidants are\\nvitamin C, vitamin E , and beta carotene . Others in-\\nclude grape seed extract , vitamin A , selenium , and\\ncoenzyme Q10. It is unknown whether or not supplemen-\\ntal antioxidants provide the same benefits as those occur-\\nring naturally in foods, however.\\nGeneral use\\nIn brief, antioxidants destroy free radicals in the\\nbody. Free radicals are byproducts of oxygen metabo-\\nlism that can damage cells and are among the causes of\\nmany degenerative diseases, especially diseases associat-\\ned with aging. They are also associated with the aging\\nprocess itself. As a person ages, cell damage accumu-\\nlates, and supplementing the diet with extra antioxidant-\\nrich foods can help slow the oxidative damage done to\\ncells. Scientific studies validate the role of antioxidants\\nin preventing many diseases. Although studies have\\nshown lower rates of cancer and heart disease in people\\nwho eat a recommended amount of fruits and vegetables,\\nrecent clinical studies have shown that supplementation\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2100\\nAntioxidants\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAyurvedic medicine—System of healing originat-\\ning in ancient India.\\nChi—Universal life energy as defined by tradition-\\nal Chinese medicine.

These include carrots, tomatoes,\\nyams, leafy greens, blueberries, billberries,ginkgo bilo-\\nba, garlic, and green tea , to name a few. A diet rich in\\nvitamin C, vitamin E, and beta carotene may help reduce\\nthe risk of some cancers, heart disease,cataracts , and\\nstrokes.\\nVitamin A\\nA study by the University of Arizona found that vita-\\nmin A has a protective affect against many types of cancer,\\naccording to Dr. Michael Colgan in his book,The New\\nNutrition. Vitamin A is a fat-soluble antioxidant found in\\nanimal products but can be made by the body from its pre-\\ncursor, beta carotene. Foods rich in vitamin A are liver,\\neggs, and fortified dairy products. Vitamin A helps bones\\nand teeth develop, and promotes vision. As an antioxidant,\\nit protects cell membranes and fatty tissue, helps repair\\ndamage caused by air pollutants, and boosts the immune\\nsystem. A deficiency of this vitamin can result in dry skin,\\nbrittle hair, vision problems, blindness, and increased sus-\\nceptibility to respiratory infections.\\nVitamin C\\nProbably the most widely used of all vitamin supple-\\nments, vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that has a myr-\\niad of functions and helps strengthen the immune system.\\nIt became famous in the 1970s when Nobel Prize-winning\\nscientist Linus Pauling advocated daily mega doses (8-10\\ngrams) of vitamin C to prevent and ease the symptoms of\\nthe common cold. Many clinical studies that show vita-\\nmin C is superior to over-the-counter medicines in reduc-\\ning the symptoms, duration, and severity of colds. As an\\nantioxidant, vitamin C may help fight cardiovascular dis-\\nease by protecting the linings of arteries from oxidative\\ndamage. In 2002, debate still continued on the vitamin’s\\neffects on heart disease. One study revealed that Vitamins\\nC and E helped reduce arteriosclerosis (hardening of the\\narteries) following heart transplants. Yet another study\\ndemonstrated that vitamin therapy had not effect on pre-\\nventing heart disease. There is some evidence and re-\\nsearch that vitamin C can help prevent cancer. Studies\\nhave shown it is also beneficial in protecting the body\\nagainst the effects of smoking and air pollutants.\\nVitamin E\\nVitamin E is a potent antioxidant by itself, but its ef-\\nfectiveness is magnified when taken with other antioxi-\\ndants, especially vitamin C, selenium, and beta carotene.\\nSome scientific evidence indicates that vitamin E helps\\npromote cardiovascular health. Past studies have demon-\\nstrated higher vitamin E intake is associated with de-\\ncreased incidence of heart disease in both men and women.\\nIn fact, the combination of Vitamin C and E can slow pro-\\ngression of cardiovascular disease following heart trans-\\nplant. In 2002, researchers stated that the vitamin combina-\\ntion might also be useful in other organ transplants. In ad-\\ndition, Harvard Medical School reported in the same year\\nthat Vitamin E might play a role in helping people live\\nlonger, citing its role in strengthening the immune system.\\nCarotenoids\\nThis class of antioxidants includes beta carotene,\\nlutein, and lycopene . They are found in a variety of\\nfruits and vegetables such as carrots, pumpkins, kale,\\nspinach, tomatoes, and pink grapefruit. Research evi-\\ndence suggests carotenoids lower the risk of heart dis-\\nease and some types of cancer, and strengthen the im-\\nmune system. Lycopene, which is concentrated in the\\nprostate gland, is believed to protect the prostate from\\ncancer. Lutein is thought to prevent macular degenera-\\ntion, a major cause of blindness, or stop its progression.\\nBeta carotene increases the lungs’ defense system in\\nsmokers or those exposed to other air-borne pollutants. It\\nalso has been used as an immune system stimulator in\\npeople with AIDS. In 2002, a report revealed that more\\nthan 90% of ophthalmologists and optometrists surveyed\\nbelieve that lutein helps prevent eye disease.\\nBioflavonoids\\nBioflavonoids are a group of about 5,000 com-\\npounds that act as antioxidants. They occur in fruits, veg-\\netables, green tea, soy products, herbs, and spices. A\\ncombination of bioflavonoids has a synergistic effect\\nwhen taken with vitamin C. They have been shown to be\\nbeneficial in treating a variety of conditions, including\\nallergies, arthritis, diabetes, hypertension, and viral in-\\nfections. One group of bioflavonoids found to be a pow-\\nerful antioxidant is oligomeric proanthocyanidins\\n(OPCs), also known generically as pycnogenol. Ex-\\ntremely high concentrations of OPCs are found in mar-\\nitime pine bark (Pinus maritima) extract, grape seed ex-\\ntract, and grape and peanut skins. Due primarily to its\\nmuch lower cost, grape seed extract is the most com-\\nmonly used OPC. Procyanidins, a group of compounds\\nfound in the extract, are thought to increase the effective-\\nness of other antioxidants, especially vitamin C and vita-\\nmin E, by helping them regenerate after neutralizing free\\nradicals in the blood and tissue.\\nOther antioxidants\\nThe other widely used antioxidants are selenium, coen-\\nzyme Q10, and certain amino acids.

The antioxidant\\nbenefits of coenzyme Q10 may include slowing the aging\\nprocess, boosting the immune system, and preventing ox-\\nidative damage to the brain. Some still suggest its use to\\ntreat a variety of cardiovascular diseases. Amino acids that\\nhave strong antioxidant effects include alpha lipoic acid,\\ncysteine,glutathione, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).\\nPreparations\\nBottled antioxidant formulae are available in a single\\npill or as part of a multivitamin. The usual dosages of an-\\ntioxidants taken individually can vary widely. The United\\nStates Department of Agriculture (USDA) has established\\nrecommended daily allowance, but these may be conserv-\\native amounts for preventing diseases. For instance, the\\nUSDA recommendation for vitamin C is 60 mg a day but\\nnatural healthcare practitioners commonly recommend\\n500 mg a day or more. The dosage may also depend on\\nwhether it is being taken to treat or prevent a specific con-\\ndition. With that in mind, the common daily dosages for\\nspecific antioxidants are: vitamin A, 5,000-15,000 IU;\\nbeta carotene, 15,000-25,000 IU; vitamin C, 250-1,500\\nmg; vitamin E, 30-400 IU; selenium, 50-400 micrograms;\\nbioflavonoids, 100-500 mg; grape seed extract, 150-200\\nmg; coenzyme Q10, 90-150 mg; alpha lipoic acid, 20-50\\nmg or 300-600 mg for elevated blood sugar levels; glu-\\ntathione, 100 mg; N-acetyl cysteine, 600 mg.\\nPrecautions\\nVitamin C: May interfere with some laboratory tests,\\nincluding urinary sugar spilling for diabetics. Vitamin A:\\nCan be toxic in high doses of more than 15,000 IU per day\\nor chronic doses for months, and may cause birth defects if\\ntaken in high doses during pregnancy. In 2002, one study\\nshowed that consistent Vitamin A intake could increase the\\nrisk of hip fractures in postmenopausal women, but the\\nstudy was not representative of all women, and more study\\non the upper limits of safe Vitamin A consumption for\\nwomen in their 40s and 50s is needed. Vitamin E: Danger-\\nous in very high doses. Carotenoids: No known precau-\\ntions are indicated for normal doses. Bioflavonoids: No\\nknown precautions are indicated for normal doses. Seleni-\\num: No precautions indicated at normal doses, but a physi-\\ncian should be consulted before taking daily doses of more\\nthan 200 micrograms. Coenzyme Q10: No known precau-\\ntions are indicated for normal dosage. Amino acids: There\\nare no known precautions indicated for alpha lipoic acid,\\ncysteine, glutathione, or NAC.\\nSide effects\\nVitamin C: Individual tolerances vary. High doses\\nmay cause cramps, diarrhea , ulcer flare-ups, kidney\\nstones, and gout in some people.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 119}, page_content='It is important to distinguish between anxiety as a\\nfeeling or experience and an anxiety disorder as a psy-\\nchiatric diagnosis. A person may feel anxious without\\nhaving an anxiety disorder. Also, a person facing a clear\\nand present danger or a realistic fear is not usually con-\\nsidered to be in a state of anxiety. In addition, anxiety\\nfrequently occurs as a symptom in other categories of\\npsychiatric disturbance.\\nDescription\\nAnxiety is related to fear, but it is not the same\\nthing. Fear is a direct, focused response to a specific\\nevent or object of which an individual is consciously\\naware. Most people will feel fear if someone points a\\nloaded gun at them or if they see a tornado forming on\\nthe horizon. They also will recognize that they are afraid.\\nAnxiety, on the other hand, is often unfocused, vague,\\nand hard to pin down to a specific cause.\\nSometimes anxiety experienced in the present may\\nstem from an event or person that produced pain and\\nfear in the past. In this experience, the anxious individual\\nmay not be consciously aware of the original source of\\nthe feeling. Anxiety has an aspect of remoteness that\\nmakes it hard for people to compare their experiences.\\nWhereas most people will be fearful in physically dan-\\ngerous situations, and can agree that fear is an appropri-\\nate response in the presence of danger, anxiety is often\\ntriggered by objects or events that are unique and specif-\\nic to an individual. An individual might be anxious be-\\ncause of a unique meaning or memory being stimulated\\nby present circumstances, not because of some immedi-\\nate danger.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAnxiety is characterized by the following symp-\\ntoms:\\n• Somatic. These physical symptoms include headaches,\\ndizziness or lightheadedness, nausea and/or vomiting,\\ndiarrhea, tingling, pale complexion, sweating, numb-\\nness, difficulty in breathing, and sensations of tightness\\nin the chest, neck, shoulders, or hands. These symptoms\\nare produced by the hormonal, muscular, and cardiovas-\\ncular reactions involved in the fight-or-flight reaction.\\n• Behavioral. Behavioral symptoms of anxiety include\\npacing, trembling, general restlessness, hyperventilation,\\npressured speech, hand wringing, and finger tapping.\\n• Cognitive. Cognitive symptoms of anxiety include re-\\ncurrent or obsessive thoughts, feelings of doom, mor-\\nbid or fear-inducing thoughts or ideas, and confusion or\\ninability to concentrate.\\nFang, James C., et al. “Effect of Vitamins C and E on Progres-\\nsion of Transplant-Associated Arteriosclerosis: A random-\\nized Trial.”The Lancet (March 30, 2002): 1108.\\nKiningham, Robert.“The Value of Antioxidant Vitamin Supple-\\nments.” American Family Physician (Sept. 1, 1999): 742.\\nKoch Kubetin, Sally. “Antioxidants Fall Short.”OB GYN News\\n(February 1, 2002): 29.\\nLanger, Stephen.“Antioxidants: Our Knights in Shining\\nArmor.”Better Nutrition (May 1997): 46- 50.\\n“Lutein Helps Protect Eyes, Doctors Say in Survey.” Ophthal-\\nmology Times (March 15, 2002): 29.\\nRaloff, Janet.“The Heart-Healthy Side of Lycopene.” Science\\nNews (Nov. 29, 1997): 348.\\nScheer, James F. “Twelve Key Antioxidants: May Their Force\\nBe With You.”Better Nutrition (Jan. 1999): 58.\\nSchindler, Martha.“The Magnificent Seven.” Vegetarian Times\\n(Feb. 1999): 86.\\n“Simvastatin Yes, Antioxidant No ñ Two Important New Stud-\\nies.” Clinical Cardiology Alert (January 2002): 1.\\nTyler, Varro E.“The Miracle of Anti-Aging Herbs.” Prevention\\n(Nov. 1999): 105.\\n“Vitamin A Intake Levels Reaffirmed as Safe and Beneficial.”\\nMedical Letter on the CDC & FDA(January 27, 2002): 14.\\nKen R.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='• Emotional. Emotional symptoms include feelings of\\ntension or nervousness, feeling “hyper” or “keyed up,”\\nand feelings of unreality, panic, or terror.\\nAnxiety can have a number of different causes. It is\\na multidimensional response to stimuli in the person’s\\nenvironment, or a response to an internal stimulus (for\\nexample, a hypochondriac’s reaction to a stomach rum-\\nbling) resulting from a combination of general biological\\nand individual psychological processes.\\nPhysical triggers\\nIn some cases, anxiety is produced by physical re-\\nsponses to stress or by certain disease processes or med-\\nications.\\nTHE AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM (ANS). The ner-\\nvous system of human beings is hard-wired to respond to\\ndangers or threats. These responses are not subject to\\nconscious control and are the same in humans as in\\nlower animals. They represent an evolutionary adapta-\\ntion to animal predators and other dangers that all ani-\\nmals—including primitive humans—had to cope with.\\nThe most familiar reaction of this type is the fight-\\nor-flight reaction to a life-threatening situation. When\\npeople have fight-or-flight reactions, the level of stress\\nhormones in their blood rises. They become more alert\\nand attentive, their eyes dilate, their heartbeats increase,\\ntheir breathing rates increase, and their digestion slows\\ndown, making more energy available to the muscles.\\nThis emergency reaction is regulated by a part of the\\nnervous system called the autonomic nervous system, or\\nANS. The ANS is controlled by the hypothalamus, a spe-\\ncialized part of the brainstem that is among a group of\\nstructures called the limbic system. The limbic system\\ncontrols human emotions through its connections to\\nglands and muscles; it also connects to the ANS and\\nhigher brain centers, such as parts of the cerebral cortex.\\nOne problem with this arrangement is that the lim-\\nbic system cannot tell the difference between a real\\nphysical threat and an anxiety-producing thought or idea.\\nThe hypothalamus may trigger the release of stress hor-\\nmones from the pituitary gland even when there is no ex-\\nternal danger.\\nA second problem is caused by the biochemical side\\neffects of too many false alarms in the ANS. When a per-\\nson responds to a real danger, his or her body relieves it-\\nself of the stress hormones by facing up to the danger or\\nfleeing from it. In modern life, however, people often\\nhave fight-or-flight reactions in situations where they can\\nneither run away nor lash out physically. As a result, their\\nbodies have to absorb all the biochemical changes of hy-\\nperarousal rather than release them. These biochemical\\nchanges can produce anxious feelings as well as muscle\\ntension and other physical symptoms of anxiety.\\nDISEASES AND DISORDERS. Anxiety can be a symp-\\ntom of certain medical conditions. For example, anxiety\\nis a symptom of certain endocrine disorders that are\\ncharacterized by overactivity or underactivity of the thy-\\nroid gland. Cushing’s syndrome, in which the adrenal\\ncortex overproduces cortisol, is one such disorder. Other\\nmedical conditions that can produce anxiety include res-\\npiratory distress syndrome, mitral valve prolapse, por-\\nphyria, and chest pain caused by inadequate blood sup-\\nply to the heart (angina pectoris).\\nMEDICATIONS AND SUBSTANCE USE. Numerous\\nmedications may cause anxiety-like symptoms as a side\\neffect. They include birth control pills, some thyroid or\\nasthmadrugs, some psychotropic agents, corticos-\\nteroids, antihypertensive drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflam-\\nmatory drugs (such as flurbiprofen and ibuprofen), and\\nlocal anesthetics. Caffeine can also cause anxiety-like\\nsymptoms when consumed in sufficient quantity.\\nWithdrawal from certain prescription drugs—pri-\\nmarily beta-blockers and corticosteroids—can cause anx-\\niety. Withdrawal from drugs of abuse, including LSD, co-\\ncaine, alcohol, and opiates, can also cause anxiety.\\nChildhood development and anxiety\\nResearchers in early childhood development regard\\nanxiety in adult life as a residue of childhood memories\\nof dependency. Humans learn during the first year of life\\nthat they are not self-sufficient and that their basic sur-\\nvival depends on others. It is thought that this early expe-\\nrience of helplessness underlies the most common anxi-\\neties of adult life, including fear of powerlessness and\\nfear of not being loved. Thus, adults can be made anx-\\nious by symbolic threats to their sense of competence or\\nsignificant relationships, even though they are no longer\\nhelpless children.\\nSymbolization\\nThe psychoanalytic model gives a lot of weight to\\nthe symbolic aspect of human anxiety; examples include\\nphobic disorders, obsessions, compulsions, and other\\nforms of anxiety that are highly individualized. Because\\nhumans mature slowly, children and adolescents have\\nmany opportunities to connect their negative experiences\\nto specific objects or events that can trigger anxious feel-\\nings in later life. For example, a person who was fright-\\nened as a child by a tall man wearing glasses may feel\\npanicky years later, without consciously knowing why, by\\nsomething that reminds him of that person or experience.\\nFreud thought that anxiety results from a person’s in-\\nternal conflicts. According to his theory, people feel anx-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2104\\nAnxiety\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 104'),\n",

In some cases, the\\nperson’s anxiety may attach itself to an object that repre-\\nsents the inner conflict. For example, someone who feels\\nanxious around money may be pulled between a desire to\\nsteal and the belief that stealing is wrong. Money be-\\ncomes a symbol for the inner conflict between doing\\nwhat is considered right and doing what one wants.\\nPhobias\\nPhobias are a special type of anxiety reaction in\\nwhich the person concentrates his or her anxiety on a\\nspecific object or situation and then tries to avoid. In\\nmost cases, the person’s fear is out of proportion to its\\n“cause.” It is estimated that 10–11% of the population\\nwill develop a phobia in their lifetime. Some phobias—\\nagoraphobia (fear of open spaces), claustrophobia (fear\\nof small or confined spaces), and social phobia, for ex-\\nample—are shared by large numbers of people. Others\\nare less common or are unique to the patient.\\nSocial and environmental stressors\\nBecause humans are social creatures, anxiety often\\nhas a social dimension. People frequently report feelings\\nof high anxiety when they anticipate or fear the loss of\\nsocial approval or love. Social phobia is a specific anxi-\\nety disorder that is marked by high levels of anxiety or\\nfear of embarrassment in social situations.\\nAnother social stressor is prejudice. People who be-\\nlong to groups that are targets of bias have a higher risk\\nof developing anxiety disorders. Some experts think, for\\nexample, that the higher rates of phobias and panic dis-\\norder among women reflects their greater social and\\neconomic vulnerability.\\nSeveral controversial studies indicate that the in-\\ncrease in violent or upsetting pictures and stories in news\\nreports and entertainment may raise people’s anxiety lev-\\nels. Stress and anxiety management programs often rec-\\nommend that patients cut down their exposure to upset-\\nting stimuli.\\nEnvironmental or occupational factors can also\\ncause anxiety. People who must live or work around sud-\\nden or loud noises, bright or flashing lights, chemical va-\\npors, or similar nuisances that they cannot avoid or con-\\ntrol may develop heightened anxiety levels.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosing anxiety is difficult and complex because\\nof the variety of possible causes and because each per-\\nson’s symptoms arise from highly personalized and indi-\\nvidualized experiences. When a doctor examines an anx-\\nious patient, he or she will first rule out physical condi-\\ntions and diseases that have anxiety as a symptom. The\\ndoctor will then take the patient’s history to see if pre-\\nscription drugs, alcohol or drug abuse, caffeine, work en-\\nvironment, or other external stressors could be triggering\\nthe anxiety. In most cases, the most important source of\\ndiagnostic information is the patient’s psychological and\\nsocial history. The doctor may administer several brief\\npsychological tests, including the Hamilton Anxiety Scale\\nand the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule (ADIS).\\nTreatment\\nMeditation and mindfulness training can benefit\\npatients with phobias and panic disorder. Hydrother-\\napy, massage therapy, and aromatherapy are useful to\\nsome anxious patients because they can promote general\\nrelaxationof the nervous system. Essential oils of\\nlavender, chamomile , neroli, sweet marjoram, and\\nylang-ylang are commonly recommended by aromather-\\napists for stress relief and anxiety reduction.\\nRelaxation training, which is sometimes called anxi-\\nety management training, includes breathing exercises\\nand similar techniques intended to help the patient pre-\\nvent hyperventilation and relieve the muscle tension as-\\nsociated with the fight-or-flight reaction. Yoga, aikido,\\ntai chi, and dance therapy help patients work with the\\nphysical, as well as the emotional, tensions that either\\npromote anxiety or are created by the anxiety.\\nHomeopathy and traditional Chinese medicine\\n(TCM) approach anxiety as a symptom of a holistic im-\\nbalance. Homeopathic practitioners select a remedy based\\non other associated symptoms and the patient’s general\\nconstitution. Homeopathic remedies for anxiety include\\nignatia, gelsemium, aconite, pulsatilla, arsenicum\\nalbum, and coffea cruda. These remedies should be pre-\\nscribed by a homeopathic healthcare professional.\\nChinese medicine regards anxiety as a disruption of qi,\\nor energy flow, inside the patient’s body. Acupuncture\\nand/or herbal therapy are standard remedies for rebalancing\\nthe entire system. Reishi (Ganoderma lucidumor Ling-Zhi)\\nis a medicinal mushroom prescribed in TCM to reduce anx-\\niety and insomnia. However, because reishi can interact\\nwith other prescription drugs and is not recommended for\\npatients with certain medical conditions, individuals should\\nconsult their healthcare practitioner before taking the reme-\\ndy. Other TCM herbal remedies for anxiety include the\\ncordycepsmushroom (also known as catepillar fungus)\\nand Chinese green tea. In addition, there are numerous\\nTCM formulas that combine multiple herbs for use as an\\nanxiety treatment, depending on the individual problem.\\nHerbs known as adaptogens may also be prescribed\\nby herbalists or holistic healthcare providers to treat anxi-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 105\\nAnxiety\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 105'),\n",

These herbs are thought to promote adaptability to\\nstress, and include Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus sen-\\nticosus), ginseng (Panax ginseng), wild yam (Dioscorea\\nvillosa), borage (Borago officinalis), licorice (Glycyrrhiza\\nglabra), chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile), milk thistle\\n(Silybum marianum), and nettles (Urtica dioica). Tonics\\nof skullcap (Scutellaria lateriafolia ), and oats ( Avena\\nsativa), may also be recommended to ease anxiety.\\nA 2002 preliminary study found that St. John’s wort\\ncould be an effective treatment for generalized anxiety.\\nPatients taking 900 mg a day and higher doses responded\\nwell in early trials. However, further research was need-\\ned, particularly at doses higher than 900 mg per day. The\\nAyurvedic herb gotu kola, long used by practitioners of\\nIndia’s holistic medical system to enhance memory and\\nrelieve varicose veins, may also help patients with anxi-\\nety by working against the startle response.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nBecause anxiety often has more than one cause and\\nis experienced in highly individual ways, its treatment\\noften requires more than one type of therapy. In some\\ncases, several types of treatment may need to be tried be-\\nfore the best combination is discovered. It usually takes\\nabout six to eight weeks to evaluate the effectiveness of a\\ntreatment regimen.\\nMedications\\nMedications are often prescribed to relieve the phys-\\nical and psychological symptoms of anxiety. Most med-\\nications work by counteracting the biochemical and\\nmuscular changes involved in the fight-or-flight reaction.\\nSome work directly on the brain chemicals that are\\nthought to underlie the anxiety.\\nANXIOLYTICS. Anxiolytics are sometimes called\\ntranquilizers. Most anxiolytic drugs are either benzodi-\\nazepines or barbiturates. However, barbiturates, once\\ncommonly used, are now rarely used in clinical practice.\\nBenzodiazepines work by relaxing the skeletal muscles\\nand calming the limbic system. They include such drugs\\nas chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and diazepam (Valium).\\nBoth barbiturates and benzodiazepines are potentially\\nhabit-forming and may cause withdrawal symptoms, but\\nbenzodiazepines are far less likely than barbiturates to\\ncause physical dependency.\\nTwo other types of anxiolytic medications include\\nmeprobamate (Equanil), which is now rarely used, and\\nbuspirone (BuSpar), a new type of anxiolytic that ap-\\npears to work by increasing the efficiency of the body’s\\nown emotion-regulating brain chemicals. Unlike barbitu-\\nrates and benzodiazepines, buspirone does not cause de-\\npendence problems, does not interact with alcohol, and\\ndoes not affect the patient’s ability to drive or operate\\nmachinery. However, buspirone is not effective against\\ncertain types of anxiety, such as panic disorder.\\nANTIDEPRESSANTS AND BETA-BLOCKERS. The treat-\\nment of choice for obsessive-compulsive disorder ,\\npanic type anxiety, and other anxiety disorders is a group\\nof antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake\\ninhibitors (SSRIs), such as Prozac and Paxil. When anxi-\\nety occurs in tandem with depressive symptoms, tricyclic\\nantidepressants such as imipramine (Tofranil) or\\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) such as\\nphenelzine (Nardil) are sometimes prescribed.\\nBeta-blockers are medications that work by block-\\ning the body’s reaction to the stress hormones that are re-\\nleased during the fight-or-flight reaction. They include\\ndrugs like propranolol (Inderal) or atenolol (Tenormin).\\nBeta-blockers are sometimes given to patients with post-\\ntraumatic anxiety symptoms or social phobic anxiety.\\nPsychotherapy\\nMost patients with anxiety will be given some form\\nof psychotherapy along with medication. Many patients\\nbenefit from insight-oriented therapies, which are de-\\nsigned to help them uncover unconscious conflicts and\\ndefense mechanisms in order to understand how their\\nsymptoms developed.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) also works well\\nwith anxious patients. In CBT, the patient is taught to\\nidentify thoughts and situations that stimulate his or her\\nanxiety, and to view them more realistically. In the be-\\nhavioral part of the program, the patient is exposed to the\\nanxiety-provoking object, situation, or internal stimulus\\n(like a rapid heart beat) in gradual stages until he or she\\nis desensitized to it.\\nExpected results\\nUnfortunately, a 2002 report stated that about half of\\nthe patients with an anxiety disorder who see their pri-\\nmary care physician go untreated. The prognosis for re-\\nsolving anxiety depends on the specific disorder and a\\nwide variety of factors, including the patient’s age, gen-\\neral health, living situation, belief system, social support\\nnetwork, and responses to different medications and\\nforms of therapy.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Anxiety Disorders.” In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders. 4th ed.

Apis mellifica is the venom of the common\\nhoneybee or a tincture made from the whole bee. Various\\nspecies of honeybees found throughout the world are\\nused for this remedy in homeopathic medicine. The rem-\\nedy made from them is usually called apis. Other folk\\nmedicine traditions use additional bee-related substances\\nin healing such as honey, beeswax, pollen,royal jelly ,\\nand propolis.\\nGeneral use\\nHomeopathic medicine operates on the principle\\nthat “like heals like.” This means that a disease can be\\ncured by treating it with products that produce the same\\nsymptoms as the disease. These products follow another\\nhomeopathic law, the Law of Infinitesimals. In opposi-\\ntion to traditional medicine, the Law of Infinitesimals\\nstates that the lower a dose of curative, the more effec-\\ntive it is. To make a homeopathic remedy, the curative is\\ndiluted many, many times until only a tiny amount re-\\nmains in a huge amount of the diluting liquid.\\nIn homeopathic terminology, the effectiveness of\\nremedies is “proved” by experimentation and reports by\\nfamous homeopathic practitioners. About 1900, both bee\\nvenom and tincture from the entire insect were proved as\\na remedy by the Central New York State Homeopathic\\nSociety.\\nIn homeopathic medicine, apis is used as a remedy\\nfor many symptoms similar to those of bee stings.

A homeopath could use apis for sore\\nthroats,mumps, urinary tract infections, and other con-\\nditions where there is a stinging or burning sensation.\\nSymptoms treated by apis usually appear quite rapid-\\nly. There is usually some swelling or edema along with\\nthe stinging sensation. Many people who need apis com-\\nplain of swollen eyelids, as if they had an eye infection. In\\nkeeping with the symptom of edema, often little urine is\\nproduced although there may be a strong urge to urinate.\\nDespite this, the patient has little thirst or desire to drink.\\nOften the patient who will be given apis appears\\nflushed or has a rough rash. The rash may appear, then\\ndisappear. The skin will be sensitive to the touch and al-\\nternatively hot and dry, then sweaty. Patients may also\\nfeel nauseated, suffer from heartburn, or have tightness\\nthroughout their chest or abdomen that feels like they\\nwill burst if they cough or strain.\\nCertain mental and emotional symptoms also appear\\nin the patient that needs apis. Sadness, weeping, and de-\\npression can occur. Apis is often used after a person ex-\\nperiences a strong emotional reaction such as jealousy,\\nfear, rage, or anger.\\nIn homeopathic medicine, the fact that certain\\nsymptoms get better or worse under different conditions\\nis used as a diagnostic tool to indicate what remedy will\\nbe most effective. Symptoms that benefit from treatment\\nwith apis get worse by applying warmth or drinking\\nwarm liquids. They also get worse from touch or pres-\\nsure, or when the person is in a closed, heated room. The\\nsymptoms are often worse on the right side, after sleep-\\ning, and in the late afternoon. Symptoms improve with\\nthe application of cold and exposure to open air.\\nHomeopathy also ascribes certain personality types\\nto certain remedies. The apis personality is said to be fid-\\ngety, restless, and unpredictable. People with the apis per-\\nsonality may have wildly inappropriate reactions to emo-\\ntional situations. They want company, but reject affection,\\nand sometimes insist that they don’t need medical atten-\\ntion when they are clearly unwell. People who need apis\\noften have bouts of unprovoked jealousy and unprovoked\\ntears. They may fear ill health and death greatly.\\nPreparations\\nThere are two homeopathic dilution scales, the deci-\\nmal (x) scale with a dilution of 1:10 and the centesimal\\n(c) scale with a dilution factor of 1:100. Once the mix-\\nture is diluted, shaken, strained, then rediluted many\\ntimes to reach the desired degree of potency, the final\\nmixture is added to lactose (a type of sugar) tablets or\\npellets. These are then stored away from light. Homeo-\\npathic apis venom is available commercially in tablets in\\nmany different strengths. Dosage depends on the symp-\\ntoms being treated. Homeopathic tincture of whole hon-\\neybee is also available in a variety of strengths.\\nHomeopathic and orthodox medical practitioners\\nagree that by the time the initial remedy solution is dilut-\\ned to strengths used in homeopathic healing, it is likely\\nthat very few molecules of the original remedy remain.\\nHomeopaths, however, believe that these remedies con-\\ntinue to work through an effect called “potentization”\\nthat has not yet been explained by mainstream scientists.\\nPrecautions\\nNo particular precautions have been noted for using\\napis. However, people who are allergic or sensitive to\\nbee venom should be cautious. They may react adversely\\nto certain potencies of homeopathic apis.\\nSide effects\\nWhen taken in the recommended dilute form, no\\nside effects from apis have been reported.

The venom is thought to reduce in-\\nflammation and boost the body’s immune system. When\\nmost people refer to apitherapy, they are referring to BVT.\\nOrigins\\nThe medicinal use of bees goes back to ancient times.\\nChinese texts dating back 2,000 years mention it, and Hip-\\npocrates wrote about it. The Egyptians were said to treat\\ndiseases with an ointment made from bees, and Greek\\nphysician and writer Galen (129–c. 199), wrote about bee\\ntreatments. In 1888, Phillip Terc, an Austrian physician,\\npublished a paper on one of the first clinical studies in-\\nvolving bee stings titled Report About a Peculiar Connec-\\ntion Between the Beestings and Rheumatism. Thereafter,\\nits use expanded throughout Europe and the United States.\\nIt spread as a type of folk remedy popularized by anecdo-\\ntal accounts, but as the twenty-first century approached,\\nthe medical community began investigating the therapy,\\nstudying its use on a pharmacological level. Though clini-\\ncal studies had begun by 2000, most people using the ther-\\napy were either doing it themselves or with the help of lay\\npractitioners. Physicians were beginning to use the thera-\\npy but mostly with an injectable form of the venom.\\nBenefits\\nThe American Apitherapy Society says it has anec-\\ndotal evidence showing bee venom is effective in the\\ntreatment of:\\n• immune system problems, such as arthritis and multi-\\nple sclerosis (MS)\\n• cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension, arrhyth-\\nmias, atherosclerosis, and varicose veins\\n• endocrine disorders, such as premenstrual syndrome,\\nmenstrual cramps, irregular periods, and decreased\\nblood glucose levels\\n• infections, like herpes simplex 1 and 2, warts, mastitis,\\nand laryngitis\\n• psychological disturbances, such as depression or\\nmood swings\\n• rheumatologic disturbances, such as rheumatoid\\narthritis, osteoarthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthri-\\ntis, bursitis, and “tennis elbow”\\n• skin conditions, such as eczema, psoriasis , corns,\\nwarts, and topical ulcers\\nApitherapy is thought of as a last-resort treatment but\\nmay be beneficial to those who cannot be helped by tradi-\\ntional therapies and medicines. MS patients have reported\\nincreased stability, along with less fatigue and muscle\\nspasm, after trying the therapy. Patients with rheumatoid\\narthritis and osteoarthritis have said pain and swelling have\\ndecreased following the stings. It has also been said to shrink\\nthe size of rheumatoid nodules. For those who have not\\nachieved relief with other treatments, apitherapy may help.\\nDescription\\nHoney bee venom contains more than 40 active sub-\\nstances, many of which have physiological effects. The\\nmost abundant compound is an anti-inflammatory agent\\ncalled melittin. This substance causes the body to pro-\\nduce cortisol, which is an agent of the body’s own heal-\\ning process. As an anti-inflammatory, melittin is 100\\ntimes more potent than hydrocortisol. It is noted in Paul\\nL. Cerrato’s RN article that experiments have shown that\\nmelittin can slow the body’s inflammatory response.\\nThat is why the venom may be helpful in treating inflam-\\nmatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis.\\nOther compounds that may have pharmacological ef-\\nfects include apamin, which works to enhance nerve trans-\\nmission; adolapin, which is an anti-inflammatory and an\\nanalgesic; and other neurotransmitters like norepinephrine\\nand dopamine and seratonin, which figure in depression.\\nThe most prevalent use of BVT is for immune sys-\\ntem and inflammatory disorders. One of the most promis-\\ning uses may be relieving the symptoms of treatment-re-\\nsistant MS. More than 1,300 people with MS have sent\\ntestimonials to the American Apitherapy Society in sup-\\nport of the treatment saying the therapy helped relieve fa-\\ntigue and muscle spasm, as well as to restore stability.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 109\\nApitherapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 109'),\n",

The cost of learning\\nthe therapy and the cost for the bees is generally not cov-\\nered by insurance. The therapy may be covered, howev-\\ner, if prescribed and administered by a physician who\\nuses an injectable form.\\nTo receive treatment, a bee is taken from a jar or hive\\nwith a pair of tweezers and held on the body part to be\\nstung. The stinger should be left in for 10 to 15 minutes.\\nThe number of stings delivered in a session and the fre-\\nquency of the sessions varies, depending on the patient’s\\ntolerance and the nature of the problem. To treat ten-\\ndonitis, a patient might need only two to five therapy ses-\\nsions involving only two to three stings per session. Treat-\\ning a more chronic problem like arthritis can take several\\nstings per session two to three times per week for up to\\nthree months. Treating MS is a prolonged effort. Those\\nwho have used it say the therapy must happen two to three\\ntimes per week for six months in order to start working.\\nOn average, doctors who use the therapy delivered\\ninjections one to two times per week. The number of in-\\njections varied widely, from one to 30 per session, de-\\npending on the ailment being treated.\\nPhysicians who use the therapy do not use live bees.\\nInstead, they obtain venom in an injectable form and in-\\nject it under the skin.\\nObviously, the more stings or injections to be adminis-\\ntered, the more time the therapy is going to take per session.\\nPreparations\\nBefore the therapy is begun, a doctor will inject the\\npatient with a weak form of the venom to test for allergic\\nreaction. The doctor will have a syringe of epinephrine\\nnearby in case a reaction does occur. If the patient is al-\\nlergic to the venom, the therapy cannot be administered.\\nLay practitioners and beekeepers who deliver live\\nstings test patients with an initial sting to the knee or\\nforearm and observe the patient to see if they are aller-\\ngic. The test sting should only be administered if the\\npractitioner has a bee-sting kit containing epinephrine\\nnearby. If a person is allergic, a reaction will generally\\noccur in 15 to 20 minutes. Up to 2% of the population\\nmay be allergic to insect venom.\\nIce may be used to numb the area where the stings\\nwill occur. It can also be used afterward to soothe the pain.\\nPrecautions\\nVenom therapy should not be used by those with se-\\nvere allergies , tuberculosis , syphilis , gonorrhea , and\\ntransient insulin-dependent diabetes.\\nSide effects\\nPain, itching, and swelling are common at the injec-\\ntion or sting site. Patients should also be cautioned that\\nsevere anaphylactic allergic reactions can lead to respira-\\ntory problems, cardiac collapse, and death. Some may\\ndevelop nodular masses or ulcers at sting sites.\\nIt seems, however, that major complications are rare. In\\nSeptember 1999, it was reported in Patient Caremagazine\\nthat Christopher M. H. Kim, director of the Monmouth Pain\\nInstitute in Red Bank, New Jersey, says he has given more\\nthan 34,000 injections to 174 patients over the past 15 years\\nand has yet to see any major complications. The venom\\nKim injects is equivalent to one to ten bee stings. The most\\ncommon side effect reported by his patients is itching, re-\\nported by 80% of his patients after the first session. After 12\\nsessions, however, only 40% still experienced itching. Of\\nhis patients, 29.7% reported swelling; 6.4% reported\\nheadache; and 5.6% reported flushing.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nDue to a growing body of anecdotal evidence to sup-\\nport the use of BVT, formal clinical studies were\\nlaunched as 2000 approached. The National Multiple\\nSclerosis Society has begun funding a study on apithera-\\npy at Georgetown University Medical Center in Washing-\\nton, D.C. The results were expected by the end of 2000.\\nWhile the study is ongoing, Joseph A. Bellanti, who\\nis overseeing the study, has already changed his view of\\nthe therapy. “In the beginning I thought it was rather\\nstrange, but after some investigation, I saw that there are\\ndefinite immunologic changes after bee venom therapy,\\nand the use of venom began to seem less farfetched,” he\\ntold Patient Care.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2110\\nApitherapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 110'),\n",

The appendix has no\\nknown function in the body, but it can become diseased.\\nAppendicitis is a medical emergency, and if it is left un-\\ntreated, the appendix may rupture and cause a potentially\\nfatal infection.\\nDescription\\nAppendicitis is the one of the most common abdomi-\\nnal emergencies found in the United States. More males\\nthan females develop appendicitis. It is rare in the elderly\\nand in children under the age of two. The hallmark symp-\\ntom of appendicitis is increasingly severe abdominal\\npain. Since many different conditions can cause abdomi-\\nnal pain, an accurate diagnosis of appendicitis can be dif-\\nficult. Other conditions can have symptoms similar to ap-\\npendicitis, especially in women. These include pelvic in-\\nflammatory disease, ruptured ovarian follicles, ruptured\\novarian cysts , tubal pregnancies, and endometriosis .\\nVarious forms of stomach upset and bowel inflammation\\nmay also mimic appendicitis.\\nA timely diagnosis of appendicitis is important, be-\\ncause a delay can result in perforation, or rupture, of the\\nappendix. When this happens, the infected contents of\\nthe appendix spill into the abdomen, potentially causing\\na serious infection of the abdomen called peritonitis.\\nVery rarely, the inflammation and symptoms of appen-\\ndicitis may disappear but recur again later. If appendici-\\ntis is suspected, the following activities should be avoid,\\nas they may cause the appendix to rupture:\\n• consuming food or drink\\n• taking pain medication, laxatives, or antacids\\n• the use of a heating pad on the affected area\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe causes of appendicitis are not totally under-\\nstood, but are believed to occur as a result of blockage of\\nthe appendix. This blockage may be due to fecal matter,\\na foreign body in the large intestine, cancerous tumors, a\\nparasite infestation, or swelling from an infection.\\nThe distinguishing symptom of appendicitis is the\\nmigration of pain to the lower right corner of the ab-\\ndomen. The abdomen often becomes rigid and tender to\\nthe touch. The patient may bend the knees in reaction to\\nthe pain. Increased rigidity and tenderness indicate an in-\\ncreased likelihood of perforation and peritonitis. Loss of\\nappetite is very common, accompanied by a low–grade\\nfever, and occasionally there is constipation or diar-\\nrhea, as well as nausea. Unfortunately, these signs and\\nsymptoms may vary widely. Atypical symptoms are par-\\nticularly present in pregnant women, the elderly, and\\nyoung children.\\nOver the years, researchers have experimented with\\nthe therapy on animals and have found that bee venom\\ncan keep arthritis at bay in rodents. A study was de-\\nscribed in RN in which researchers induced a condition\\nsimilar to rheumatoid arthritis in rats and found that\\ndaily injections of bee venom suppressed the disease.\\nHarvard Medical School professor John Mills, who\\nworks with arthritis patients, told Country Journal that he\\nhas seen patients achieve short-term relief through the\\nsting therapy, though he does not condone its use. He be-\\nlieves the same response could be achieved through drug\\ntherapy without the allergic risk the venom poses to some.\\nWhile animal studies, preliminary results of clinical\\ntrials, and anecdotal evidence suggest BVT may have\\ntherapeutic effects, until clinical trials on humans are\\ncompleted, there is no way to know if the treatment\\nworks. The placebo effect may also be responsible for\\nsome degree of benefit patients achieve.\\nTraining & certification\\nSome physicians practice BVT, but the majority of\\nthose seeking treatment rely on lay practitioners, bee keep-\\ners, themselves, or a partner, who is taught to use the bees.\\nThose seeking treatment can contact the American\\nApitherapy Society to find a practitioner near them.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nCerrato, Paul L. “A Therapeutic Bee Sting?” RN 61, 8 (August\\n1998): 57-58.\\nD’Epiro, Nancy Walsh. “Bee Venom for Multiple Sclerosis.”\\nPatient Care 33, 14 (September 15, 1999): 27-31.\\nGranstrom, Chris. “Stinging Away the Pain.” Country Journal\\n23, 5 (September/October 1996): 22-25.\\nSomerfield, Stanley D. “Bee Venom and Arthritis: Magic,\\nMyth or Medicine?” New Zealand Medical Journal 99,\\n800 (April 1986): 281-283.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Apitherapy Society. 5390 Grande Road.

Bergman,\\nCorbis Images. Reproduced by permission.)\\nPatients whose symptoms and physical examination\\nare compatible with a diagnosis of appendicitis are usu-\\nally hospitalized and a surgical exploration of the ab-\\ndomen, called a laparotomy, is done immediately to con-\\nfirm the diagnosis. A normal appendix is discovered in\\nabout 10–20% of patients who undergo laparotomy. Be-\\ncause of the potential for a life–threatening ruptured ap-\\npendix, persons suspected of having appendicitis are\\noften taken to surgery before the diagnosis is certain. If\\nthe symptoms are not clear, surgery may be postponed\\nuntil they progress enough to confirm a diagnosis. Some-\\ntimes the surgeon will remove a normal appendix as a\\nsafeguard against appendicitis in the future.\\nTreatment\\nAppendicitis must be treated by a surgeon in a hos-\\npital setting. However, acupressure can be helpful for\\nrecuperation. One dose of homeopathic phosphorus 30c\\ncan be taken before surgery to help reduce nausea, light-\\nheadedness, and disorientation due to anesthesia. Phos-\\nphorus 6c can be also taken two to three times in the\\nhours following surgery. Other appropriate remedies\\nmay include Aconite napellus 30c, Arnica montana 30c,\\nGelsemium 6c, and Staphysagria 30c.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe treatment for sudden, severe appendicitis is\\nsurgery to remove the appendix, called an appendecto-\\nmy. An appendectomy may be done by opening the ab-\\ndomen in the standard operating technique, or through\\nlaparoscopy, in which a small incision is made through\\nthe navel. Recovery may be faster with a laparoscopy\\nthan with an ordinary appendectomy. An appendectomy\\nshould be performed within 48 hours of the first appear-\\nance of symptoms, to avoid a rupture of the appendix\\nand peritonitis. Antibiotics are given before surgery in\\ncase peritonitis has already taken hold. If peritonitis is\\ndiscovered, the abdomen must also be irrigated and\\ndrained of pus, and then treated with multiple antibiotics\\nfor 7-14 days.\\nExpected results\\nAppendicitis is usually treated successfully by ap-\\npendectomy. Unless there are complications, the patient\\nshould recover without further problems. The mortality\\nrate in cases without complications is less than 0.1%.\\nWhen an appendix has ruptured, or a severe infection has\\ndeveloped, the likelihood is higher for complications,\\nwith slower recovery, or death from disease. There are\\nhigher rates of perforation and mortality among children\\nand the elderly.\\nIf bacteria multiply unchecked within the appendix, it\\nwill become swollen and filled with pus, and may eventual-\\nly rupture. This produces an inflammation of the lining of\\nthe abdominal wall, or peritonitis, which is a medical emer-\\ngency. Signs of rupture include the presence of symptoms\\nfor more than 24 hours, a high fever, a distended abdomen,\\na high white blood cell count, and an increased heart rate.\\nDiagnosis\\nA careful examination is the best way to diagnose\\nappendicitis. It is often difficult even for experienced\\nphysicians to distinguish the symptoms of appendicitis\\nfrom those of other abdominal disorders. The physician\\nwill ask questions regarding the nature and history of the\\npain, as well doing an abdominal exam to feel for in-\\nflammation, tenderness, and rigidity. Bowel sounds will\\nbe decreased or absent. A blood test will be given, be-\\ncause an increased white cell count may help confirm a\\ndiagnosis of appendicitis. Urinalysis may help to rule out\\na urinary tract infection that can mimic appendicitis. In\\ncases with a questionable diagnosis, other tests, such as a\\ncomputed tomography scan (CT) or ultrasound may be\\nperformed to help with diagnosis without resorting to\\nsurgery. Abdominal x rays, however, are not of much\\nvalue except when the appendix has ruptured.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 112'),\n",

It was developed from traditional kinesiol-\\nogy in 1964 by George G. Goodheart, a chiropractor\\nfrom Detroit, Michigan. He observed that each large\\nmuscle relates to a body organ. A weakness in a muscle\\nmay mean that there is a problem in the associated\\norgan. Goodheart found that by treating the muscle and\\nmaking it strong again, he was able to improve the func-\\ntion of the organ as well. For example, if a particular nu-\\ntritional supplement was given to a patient, and the mus-\\ncle tested strong, it was the correct supplement for the\\npatient. If the muscle remained weak, it was not. Other\\nmethods of treatment can be evaluated in a similar man-\\nner. Goodheart also found that painful nodules (small\\nbumps) may be associated with a weak muscle. By\\ndeeply massaging the muscle, he was able to improve its\\nstrength. Goodheart’s findings in 1964 led to the origin\\nand insertion treatment, the first method developed in\\nAK. Other diagnostic and therapeutic procedures were\\ndeveloped for various reflexes described by other chiro-\\npractors and doctors. Goodheart incorporated acupunc-\\nture meridian therapy into AK after reading the writings\\nof Felix Mann, M.D.\\nGoodheart considered AK to be a therapeutic tool\\nthat incorporates feedback from the body. He said that\\n“applied kinesiology is based on the fact that the body\\nlanguage never lies.” He felt that the body’s muscles\\nwere indicators of disharmony. Once muscle weakness\\nhas been ascertained, the problem may be solved in a va-\\nriety of ways. If a practitioner approaches the problem\\ncorrectly, he believed, making the proper and adequate\\ndiagnosis and treatment, the outcome is satisfactory both\\nto the doctor and to the patient.\\nBenefits\\nAK is not designed for crisis medicine.

This therapy is designed to\\nbe a part of a holistic approach to preventive medicine.\\nThe goals of AK are to (1) restore normal nerve function,\\n(2) achieve normal endocrine, immune, digestive, and\\nother internal organ functions, (3) intervene early in de-\\ngenerative processes to prevent or delay pathological con-\\nditions, and to (4) restore postural balance, correct gait\\n(walking) impairment, and improve range of motion.\\nDescription\\nAccording to AK, each muscle in the body relates to\\na specific meridian or energy pathway (acupuncture\\nlines) in the body. These meridians also relate to organs\\nor glands, allowing the muscles to provide information\\nabout organ or gland function and energy.

Muscle testing involves putting the body into a\\nposition that requires a certain muscle to remain contract-\\ned, and then applying pressure against the muscle. The\\ntesting does not measure strength but is meant to reveal\\nstresses and imbalances in the body through the tension\\nin the muscle. The test evaluates the ability of a control-\\nling system (like the nervous system) to adapt the muscle\\nto meet the changing pressure of the examiner’s test. AK\\npractitioners also examine structural factors such as pos-\\nture, gait, and range of motion. Some chiropractors use\\nAK to help them evaluate the success of spinal adjust-\\nment. A leg muscle is tested for strength or weakness to\\ndetermine whether the adjustments made are appropriate.\\nAccording to AK, common internal causes of mus-\\ncle weakness include:\\n• dysfunction of nerve supply (nerve interference be-\\ntween spine and muscles)\\n• impairment of lymphatic drainage\\n• reduction of blood supply\\n• abnormal pressure in cerebral fluid affecting nerve-to-\\nmuscle relationships\\n• blockage of an acupuncture meridian\\n• imbalance of chemicals\\n• dysfunction of organs or glands\\n• excesses or deficiencies in nutrition\\nPhysiological reactions to chemicals, including\\nthose associated with nutrition and allergies , may also\\nbe evaluated using AK. The AK protocol for testing\\nchemical compounds is to place the substance on the pa-\\ntient’s tongue so that he tastes the material, and the nor-\\nmal chemical reactions of ingestion begin. In some\\ncases, the substances are inhaled through the nose. The\\nAK practitioner then tests the associated muscle-organ\\npattern to determine where or if there is a strength or\\nweakness. The patient does not need to swallow the sub-\\nstance for a change in strength or weakness to be identi-\\nfied. David S. Walther, a diplomate of the International\\nCollege of Applied Kinesiology, has indicated that “it is\\npossible that the central nervous system, recognizing the\\ncompound being ingested, relays information to the or-\\ngans and glands preparing for use of the compound. If\\nthe compound is recognized as beneficial, the energy\\npattern is immediately enhanced, influencing not only\\nthe organ or gland, but also the associated muscle.”\\nAK has been used as a diagnostic health tool for a\\nvariety of conditions.\\nBone health\\n• neck/low back pain and sciatica\\n• whiplash\\n• frozen shoulder\\nJoint health\\n• carpal tunnel syndrome\\n• arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis)\\n• sports injuries\\nMuscle health\\n• tennis elbow\\n• heel spurs\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2114\\nApplied kinesiology\\nDr. George Goodheart was born in Detroit, Michi-\\ngan, in 1918 and became a second-generation doctor\\nof chiropractic.

Most prac-\\ntitioners of AK are chiropractors, but naturopaths, med-\\nical doctors, dentists, osteopaths, nutritionists, physical\\ntherapists, massage therapists, podiatrists, psychiatrists,\\nand nurse practitioners are also involved. In 1991, 37.2%\\nof 4,835 full-time chiropractors in the United States who\\nresponded to a survey by the National Board of Chiro-\\npractic Examiners (NBCE) said they used AK in their\\npractice. Subsequent NBCE surveys indicated that 31%\\nof chiropractors in Canada, 60% in Australia, and 72% in\\nNew Zealand use AK.\\nMost practitioners of AK utilize a holistic approach\\nand evaluate a person from a triad-based health perspec-\\ntive. Generally, chiropractors approach health and heal-\\ning from a structural basis, medical doctors generally\\nfrom a chemical basis, and psychiatrists and psycholo-\\ngists from a mental or emotional basis. Applied kinesiol-\\nogists attempt to work with all three areas of health, and\\nin some cases, include a spiritual dimension.\\nThe use of AK is often included in insurance cover-\\nage if the policy covers chiropractor benefits. The cost of\\nthe AK examination is similar to the costs of other chiro-\\npractic practices.\\nPreparations\\nSince AK is a non-invasive diagnostic tool, there are\\nno preparations required.\\nPrecautions\\nAK should only by used by trained professionals\\nwith the necessary expertise to perform specific and ac-\\ncurate tests. The AK examination should be combined\\nwith a standard physical diagnosis, which often includes\\nlaboratory tests, x rays, health and dietary history, and\\nother special tests. An AK examination should enhance a\\nstandard diagnosis, not replace it.

A literature re-\\nview published in 1999 by researchers from the School\\nof Medicine at the University of North Carolina at\\nChapel Hill and the Foundation for Allied Conservative\\nTherapies Research in Chapel Hill stated that, although\\nAK appears to be a promising methodology, there is a\\nlack of research results relevant to clinical practice and\\noutcomes of AK care. They found this lack of results\\nsurprising, since cost, satisfaction, utilization, and\\nchanges in symptoms are the important results of clinical\\npractice. In addition, they determined that some studies\\nthat were supposed to be an evaluation of AK procedures\\ndid not actually use clinical practices and principles of\\nAK. However, from studies adhering to AK principles\\nand employing standardized training by well-trained\\npractitioners, they did state there was some evidence that\\nAK is an objectively verifiable phenomenon. They sug-\\ngested that “future studies of AK should focus on out-\\ncomes of care, including symptoms, function, costs, and\\nsafety. Only well-designed studies that account for the\\nindividual nature of AK diagnosis and treatment and pre-\\nserve the proper clinical context of AK treatment will be\\ninformative. Understanding the individual components\\nof the process of AK treatment remains important. Stud-\\nies addressing validation of isolated AK procedures need\\nto meet the methodological challenges of studying ap-\\npropriate subjects that reflects the current recognized\\npractice and understanding of AK.

The apri-\\ncot tree carries the botanical name Prunus armeniaca. It\\nis a drupe, meaning stone-fruit, and a close relative of\\nthe peach. Both are very similar in appearance and quali-\\nties. The apricot is also sometimes called apricock or Ar-\\nmeniaca vulgaris. Like the plum, both peaches and apri-\\ncots are distantly related to the rose and are classified as\\nmembers of the Rosacaeae family.\\nApricots grow on small to medium size trees, which\\nare hardy in most temperate areas. White, multi-petaled\\nblossoms with a slight reddish tinge nearer to the base of\\nthe flower emerge onto the bare branches in early spring,\\nbefore the tree’s heart-shaped leaves appear. By late July\\nor early August, the apricot fruit ripens. There are more\\nthan 20 varieties of apricot known to botanists.\\nThe name Prunus armeniaca is actually a misnomer\\nbased upon the long-held belief that apricots initially came\\nfrom Armenia. It is now known that in reality they originat-\\ned in the Far East, most likely in the Himalayas and North-\\nern China. It is speculated that the apricot had already mi-\\ngrated to the Middle East before the Old Testament and that\\nthe apples described in the Garden of Eden in Genesis were\\nactually apricots. During the reign of King Henry VIII in\\nthe 1500s, apricots were brought to England from Italy.\\nThough smaller than the peach, apricots have the\\nsame russet-tinted, golden, velvet appearing exterior and\\ndeeper golden-orange flesh inside. The innermost layers\\nform the large, woody compressed stone, or pit, that con-\\ntains at its very center, the kernel, or seed. When pressed,\\nnearly half of this kernel gives forth an oil very chemi-\\ncally similar to the oil found in sweet almond and peach\\nkernels. This oil contains olein, glyceride of linoleic\\nacid, and a transparent, crystalline chemical compound,\\namygdalin, or laetrile. This compound is also known as\\nvitamin B17. The oil is chemically indistinguishable from\\noil of bitter almond. Although the oil from apricot seeds\\nusually breaks down into a toxic substance capable of\\ncausing death within the human body, there are also vari-\\neties of apricot seed that are reported to be edible.\\nGeneral use\\nBecause the oil from the apricot seed is far less ex-\\npensive than oil of almond, confectioners use it in place of\\nbitter almond oil for flavoring sweets and as a culinary\\nseasoning. A liqueur manufactured in France is made\\nfrom apricot seed and is called Eau de Noyaux.Apricot oil\\nis also used extensively in the manufacture of cosmetics,\\noften being fraudulently added to almond oil. It has skin\\nsoftening properties and is often used in making soaps,\\nhand creams, cold cream, and perfume preparations.\\nChinese Medicine practitioners use apricot seed as a\\ntreatment in respiratory diseases, including bronchitis\\nand emphysema . It is believed to act as an cough sup-\\npressant and expectorant and, because of the oil, also\\nused as a laxative.\\nThere has been considerable controversy regarding\\napricot seed, and specifically amygdalin, one of its com-\\nponents. Since the 1920, in many countries around the\\nglobe it has been recognized as a possible cancer preven-\\ntative and malignant cell growth inhibitor. In San Francis-\\nco, biochemist Ernst Krebs’s article The Nitrilosides (Vit-\\namin B17)-Their Nature, Occurrence and Metabolic Sig-\\nnificance (Antineoplastic Vitamin B 17) theorized that\\namygdalin, with diet and vitamins, could inhibit cancer-\\nous growths. In the years since, it has been used in many\\ncountries as a cancer treatment, thought to be especially\\nbeneficial in the treatment of smoking-related tumors\\nsuch as lung cancer. Several studies done in the United\\nStates throughout the 1970s and early 1980s demonstrat-\\ned that amygdalin did not kill cancer cells. Review of pa-\\ntients’ records where there had been reported cures or re-\\nmarkable size reduction in tumors did not provide credi-\\nble evidence of amygdalin ability to treat cancer effec-\\ntively. There has been significant documentation that\\namygdalin breaks down into cyanide, a potent poison, in\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 117\\nApricot seed\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 117'),\n",

However, it is\\navailable in other countries, including Mexico, and in\\nChinese pharmacies and Asian markets. It is sold both as\\nthe whole kernel or seed, or in decoctions including\\ncough syrups. Chinese practitioners usually combine\\napricot seed with other herbs, including white mulberry\\nleaf or ophiopogon, a tuber grown in Asia. A paste made\\nof apricot seed and sugar has been shown, in some Chi-\\nnese medical trials, to relieve chronic bronchitis.\\nPrecautions\\nAs noted previously, the amygdalin in apricot seed\\nbreaks down within the body into a form of the deadly\\npoison cyanide, or prussic acid. There has been consider-\\nable debate concerning its level of toxicity to human be-\\nings. Following an Oklahoma judicial decision legalizing\\nthe importation of amygdalin in 1986, clinical trials were\\nbegun by the FDA and National Cancer Institute in 1987.\\nAmygdalin was used, along with the diet, enzymes, and\\nvitamins suggested by pro-amygdalin factions. The re-\\nport from this study concludes: “No substantive benefit\\nwas observed in terms of cure, improvement, or stabi-\\nlization of the cancer.” They further reported that “the\\nhazards of amygdalin therapy were evidenced in several\\npatients by symptoms of cyanide toxicity or by blood\\ncyanide levels approaching lethal range. Amygdalin is a\\ntoxic drug that is not effective as a cancer treatment.” It\\nhas been reported that ten apricot seeds can kill a child.\\nSide effects\\nChinese practitioners caution using apricot seed if the\\nperson being treated suffers from diarrhea. Headache\\nand nausea have been reported following ingestion of\\nsmall amounts. The most serious side effect of apricot\\nseed is potential cyanide poisoning. When large doses of\\ncyanide are ingested, death is almost instantaneous. Toxic-\\nity from smaller doses is manifested by vomiting, diar-\\nrhea, mental confusion, vertigo, headache, extreme dysp-\\nnea, and violent respirations, slow pulse, weakness, glassy\\nor protruding eyes, dilated pupils, and a characteristic\\n(peach blossoms, bitter almond) odor to the breath.\\nInteractions\\nPractitioners of Chinese medicine advise that apri-\\ncot seed should not be given in combination with the\\nherbs astragalus, skullcap, or kudzu root.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCarper, Jean.

Rainer Hambrecht and colleagues from the Univer-\\nsity of Leipzig in Germany did the research by dividing\\nthe group into four sections. One group took 8 g of argi-\\nnine daily for four weeks. A second took no supplement,\\nbut did daily forearm exercises. The third did both the ex-\\nercises, and took the supplement daily. The fourth group\\nwas a control group and did nothing except taking their\\nusual medication, as did the others. Because of the known\\nfact that arginine is naturally converted into nitric oxide by\\nthe human body, the result of that chemical relaxing blood\\nvessels was also known when the experiment began. The\\ngroup that took the arginine alone showed an improve-\\nment in their blood-vessel dilation by four times, as did\\nthe group doing exercises alone. The third who did both,\\nshowed an increase six times better than the original\\nblood-dilation factor. Promise in the future use of arginine\\nin treating heart patients with this condition was indicated\\nas researchers continued to perform further tests. Accord-\\ning to an article by Liz Brown written in Better Nutrition\\nin June 2000, also discussing the Leipzig study, “Numer-\\nous other studies have shown that arginine has a vadodila-\\ntory effect on people with high cholesterol levels, those\\nwith high blood pressure and others with compromised\\ncirculation associated with heart disease.”\\nOther research in the use of arginine has indicated\\nthat arginine is crucial to the wound-healing process,\\nparticularly in the elderly for whom blood circulation is\\npoor. Arginine is necessary for growth periods but not\\nfor body maintenance.\\nBenefits of the use of arginine as a supplement include:\\n• improves immune response to bacteria, viruses, and\\ntumor cells.\\n• promotes wound healing by repairing tissues\\n• plays a crucial role in the regeneration of liver\\n• responsible for release of growth hormones\\n• promotes muscle growth\\n• improves cardiovascular functioning\\nArginine is used as a supplement in the treatment of\\nheart patients with arterial heart disease ; as an intra-\\nvenous supplement to patients with liver dysfunction; as\\na supplement for easing exercise-related pains due to the\\nheart muscle not getting enough blood to circulate to the\\nmuscles in the calves. Supplements that combine argi-\\nnine with other amino acids, such as ornithine and\\nlysine, are purported to assist in muscle-building exercis-\\nes by minimizing body fat and maximizing muscle tone.\\nResults vary among those who have taken these supple-\\nments. Arginine is also present in “multi” amino acids\\ncapsules that are taken as a dietary supplement.\\nNew information released in 2002 showed that treat-\\nment with arginine improved immune function in HIV\\npatients and proved safe for these patients when used on\\na short-term patients. Other new research was finding\\nthat arginine supplements worked as an effective antico-\\nagulant, but unlike aspirin and other anticoagulants,\\ncould prevent clotting without increasing stroke risk.\\nNew research also is showing arginine’s effectivenss in\\nfighting cancer and protecting and detoxifying the liver,\\nimproving male fertility, and promoting healing.\\nPreparations\\nArginine supplements as an alternative medicine\\ntherapy are normally taken in either tablet or capsule\\nform. In naturopathic treatment of liver dysfunction, the\\nsupplement would be added intravenously as a powder\\ndiluted in liquid. Discoveries reported in 2000 indicated\\nthat in the treatment of arterial heart disease, the inges-\\ntion of arginine tablets or capsules of 6–9 g a day are\\nhelpful in dilating blood vessels to ease circulation and\\nprevent the buildup of cholesterol.\\nPrecautions\\nLong-term effects of arginine supplements have not\\nyet been determined. Consultation with a physician re-\\ngarding individual needs is always advised. Individuals\\nwho attempt to treat their own heart ailments, or intend\\nto guard against any potential difficulty, should seek ad-\\nvice of a physician. Arginine does not show any positive\\nresults in treatment of men with damaged valves or en-\\nlarged heart tissue.\\nArginine has been suspected in the formation of cold\\nsores. Some practitioners suggest that consuming foods\\nhigh in arginine, such as nuts, grains, and chocolates, can\\npromote cold sores. Reducing intake of foods high in\\narginine and increasing intake of lysine (another amino\\nacid) can reduce or even eliminate the cold sore problem.\\nSide effects\\nAs previously noted, the use of supplemental argi-\\nnine should be monitored for use with specific problems.\\nOverdose could result in unforeseen complications,\\nwhile regular use might or might not help ease everyday\\nproblems, such as relaxation of muscles not due to the\\nspecific heart ailment of arterial disease.

This attractive herb is\\nnative to the mountains of Siberia and central Europe,\\nwhere the leaves were smoked as a substitute for tobacco.\\nThis practice led to a common name for the herb: moun-\\ntain tobacco. There are several North American species of\\narnica, including A. fulgens, A. sororia, and A. cordifolia.\\nArnica thrives in the northern mountains of the United\\nStates and Canada, in high pastures and woodlands.\\nArnica grows from a cylindrical, hairy rhizome with a\\ncreeping underground stem. First year leaves are downy\\nand grow in a flat rosette at the base of the stem. In the sec-\\nond year, arnica sends up a round, hairy stem with smaller,\\nsessile leaves growing in one to three opposite pairs. This\\ncentral stem may branch into three or more stems each\\nwith a terminal composite blossom. Arnica’s aromatic,\\ndaisy-like flowers have 10–14 bright yellow rays, each\\nwith three notches at the end. Flower rays are irregularly\\nbent back. The central disk is composed of tubular florets.\\nArnica blooms from June to August.

A North American indigenous tribe, the\\nCataulsa, prepared a tea from arnica roots to ease back\\npains. The German writer Goethe credited arnica with\\nsaving his life by bringing down a persistent high fever.\\nArnica preparations are used extensively in Russia. Folk\\nuse there includes external treatment of wounds, black\\neye, sprains, and contusions. Arnica has been used in\\nRussian folk medicine to treat uterine hemorrhage, my-\\nocarditis, arteriosclerosis,angina pectoris, cardiac insuf-\\nficiency, and in numerous other unproven applications.\\nGeneral use\\nArnica flowers, fresh or dried, are used medicinally.\\nMany herbalists consider arnica to be a specific remedy\\nfor bruises, sprains, and sore muscles. The herb is known\\nby some as “tumbler’s cure all,” reflecting this common\\nmedicinal use. A compress soaked in an arnica infusion\\nmay relieve the inflammation of phlebitis. A few drops of\\narnica tincture added to warm water in a foot bath will re-\\nlieve fatigue and soothe sore feet. A hair rinse prepared\\nwith arnica extract has been used to treat alopecia neuroti-\\nca, an anxiety condition leading to hair loss. The very di-\\nlute homeopathic preparation ingested following a shock\\nor muscle/soft tissue trauma is said to be beneficial. The\\nhomeopathic preparation is also used to relieve vertigo,\\nhoarseness, and seasickness. Studies have determined that\\narnica has properties that act as an immunostimulant. The\\nextract of arnica has been shown to stimulate the action of\\nwhite blood cells in animal studies, increasing resistance\\nto bacterial infections, such as salmonella.\\nGerman studies have isolated sesquiterpenoid lac-\\ntones, including helenalin and dihydrohelenalin, in arni-\\nca. These compounds were found to possess the pharma-\\ncologic properties responsible for arnica’s anti-inflamma-\\ntory and analgesic effects. Arnica contains sesquiterpene\\nlactones, flavonoid glycosides, alkaloid, volatile oil, tan-\\nnin, and isomeric alcohol, including arnidio and foradiol.\\nArnica is approved for external use as an anti-in-\\nflammatory, analgesic, and antiseptic by the German\\nCommission E, an advisory panel on herbal medicines.\\nThere are over one hundred medicinal preparations using\\narnica extracts commercially available in Germany. In\\nthe United States, arnica is widely used in topical appli-\\ncation for bruises, aches, sprains, and inflammations. Ar-\\nnica was listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia from the early\\n1800s until 1960.\\nPreparations\\nArnica is available commercially in the form of lini-\\nments and massage oil for external application, and in\\nvery dilute homeopathic preparations considered safe for\\ninternal use.\\nHarvest fully open arnica blossoms throughout the\\nflowering season. Pick the flower heads on a sunny day\\nafter the morning dew has evaporated. Spread the blos-\\nsoms on a paper-lined tray to dry in a bright and airy room\\naway from direct sun. Temperature in the drying room\\nshould be at least 70°F (21.1°C). When the blossoms are\\ncompletely dry, store in a dark glass container with an air-\\ntight lid. The dried herb will maintain medicinal potency\\nfor 12–18 months. Clearly label the container with the\\nname of the herb and the date and place harvested.\\nTincture: Combine four ounces of fresh or dried ar-\\nnica flowers with one pint of brandy, gin, or vodka in a\\nglass container. The alcohol should be enough to cover\\nthe flowers. The ratio should be close to 50/50 alcohol to\\nwater. Stir and cover. Place the mixture in a dark cup-\\nboard for three to five weeks. Shake the mixture several\\ntimes each day. Strain and store in a tightly capped,\\nclearly labeled, dark glass bottle. Tinctures, properly pre-\\npared and stored, will retain medicinal potency for two\\nyears or more. Arnica tincture should not be ingested\\nwithout supervision of a qualified herbalist or physician.\\nOintment: Simmer one ounce of dried and powdered\\narnica flowers with one ounce of olive oil for several\\nhours on very low heat. Combine this medicinal oil with\\nmelted beeswax to desired consistency. Pour into dark\\nglass jars while still warm. Seal with tightly fitting lids\\nwhen cool and label appropriately.\\nInfusion: Place two to three teaspoons of chopped,\\nfresh arnica blossoms in a warmed glass container. Bring\\ntwo cups of fresh, nonchlorinated water to the boiling\\npoint, add it to the herbs. Cover. Simmer for about 10\\nminutes. Strain. The prepared tea will store for about two\\ndays in the refrigerator. The infusion may be used to\\nbathe unbroken skin surfaces and to provide relief for\\nrheumatic pain, chillbains, bruises, and sprains. Because\\nof the toxicity of arnica, it is best to avoid internal use\\nwithout qualified medical supervision.\\nPrecautions\\nArnica is deadly in large quantities.

It is sometimes used in combi-\\nnation with massage and other therapeutic techniques as\\npart of a holistic treatment approach.\\nOrigins\\nAromatic plants have been employed for their heal-\\ning, preservative, and pleasurable qualities throughout\\nrecorded history in both the East and West. As early as\\n1500 B.C. the ancient Egyptians used waters, oils, in-\\ncense, resins, and ointments scented with botanicals for\\ntheir religious ceremonies.\\nThere is evidence that the Chinese may have recog-\\nnized the benefits of herbal and aromatic remedies much\\nearlier than this. The oldest known herbal text, Shen\\nNung’s Pen Ts’ao(c. 2700–3000 B.C.) catalogs over 200\\nbotanicals. Ayurveda, a practice of traditional Indian\\nmedicine that dates back more than 2,500 years, also\\nused aromatic herbs for treatment.\\nThe Romans were well known for their use of fra-\\ngrances. They bathed with botanicals and integrated them\\ninto their state and religious rituals. So did the Greeks,\\nwith a growing awareness of the medicinal properties of\\nherbs. Greek physician and surgeon Pedanios Dioscorides,\\nwhose renown herbal text De Materia Medica (60 A.D.)\\nwas the standard textbook for Western medicine for 1,500\\nyears, wrote extensively on the medicinal value of botani-\\ncal aromatics. The Medica contained detailed information\\non some 500 plants and 4,740 separate medicinal uses for\\nthem, including an entire section on aromatics.\\nWritten records of herbal distillation are found as\\nearly as the first century A.D., and around 1000 A.D., the\\nnoted Arab physician and naturalist Avicenna described\\nthe distillation of rose oil from rose petals, and the medi-\\ncinal properties of essential oils in his writings. Howev-\\ner, it wasn’t until 1937, when French chemist René-Mau-\\nrice Gattefossé published Aromatherapie: Les Huiles es-\\nsentielles, hormones végé tales , that aromatherapie, or\\naromatherapy, was introduced in Europe as a medical\\ndiscipline. Gattefossé, who was employed by a French\\nperfumeur, discovered the healing properties of lavender\\noil quite by accident when he suffered a severe burn\\nwhile working and used the closest available liquid,\\nlavender oil, to soak it.\\nIn the late twentieth century, French physician Jean\\nValnet used botanical aromatics as a front line treatment\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2122\\nAromatherapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 122'),\n",

He wrote about\\nhis use of essential oils and their healing and antiseptic\\nproperties, in his 1964 book Aromatherapie, traitement\\ndes maladies par les essences des plantes , which popu-\\nlarized the use of essential oils for medical and psychi-\\natric treatment throughout France. Later, French bio-\\nchemist Mauguerite Maury popularized the cosmetic\\nbenefits of essential oils, and in 1977 Robert Tisserand\\nwrote the first English language book on the subject,The\\nArt of Aromatherapy , which introduced massage as an\\nadjunct treatment to aromatherapy and sparked its popu-\\nlarity in the United Kingdom.\\nBenefits\\nAromatherapy offers diverse physical and psycho-\\nlogical benefits, depending on the essential oil or oil\\ncombination and method of application used. Some\\ncommon medicinal properties of essential oils used in\\naromatherapy include: analgesic, antimicrobial, anti-\\nseptic, anti-inflammatory, astringent, sedative, anti-\\nspasmodic, expectorant, diuretic, and sedative. Essen-\\ntial oils are used to treat a wide range of symptoms\\nand conditions, including, but not limited to, gastroin-\\ntestinal discomfort, skin conditions, menstrual pain\\nand irregularities, stress-related conditions, mood dis-\\norders, circulatory problems, respiratory infections ,\\nand wounds.\\nDescription\\nIn aromatherapy, essential oils are carefully selected\\nfor their medicinal properties. As essential oils are ab-\\nsorbed into the bloodstream through application to the\\nskin or inhalation, their active components trigger cer-\\ntain pharmalogical effects (e.g., pain relief).\\nIn addition to physical benefits, aromatherapy has\\nstrong psychological benefits. The volatility of an oil, or\\nthe speed at which it evaporates in open air, is thought to\\nbe linked to its specific psychological effect. As a rule of\\nthumb, oils that evaporate quickly are considered emo-\\ntionally uplifting, while slowly-evaporating oils are\\nthought to have a calming effect.\\nEssential oils commonly used in aromatherapy treat-\\nment include:\\n• Roman chamomile ( Chamaemelum nobilis ).

While some basic aromatherapy\\nhome treatments can be self-administered, medical aro-\\nmatherapy should always be performed under the guid-\\nance of an aromatherapist, herbalist, massage therapist,\\nnurse, or physician.\\nInhalation\\nThe most basic method of administering aromather-\\napy is direct or indirect inhalation of essential oils. Sev-\\neral drops of an essential oil can be applied to a tissue or\\nhandkerchief and gently inhaled. A small amount of es-\\nsential oil can also be added to a bowl of hot water and\\nused as a steam treatment. This technique is recommend-\\ned when aromatherapy is used to treat respiratory and/or\\nskin conditions. Aromatherapy steam devices are also\\navailable commercially. A warm bath containing essen-\\ntial oils can have the same effect as steam aromatherapy,\\nwith the added benefit of promoting relaxation. When\\nused in a bath, water should be lukewarm rather than hot\\nto slow the evaporation of the oil.\\nEssential oil diffusers, vaporizers, and light bulb\\nrings can be used to disperse essential oils over a large\\narea. These devices can be particularly effective in aro-\\nmatherapy that uses essential oils to promote a healthier\\nhome environment. For example, eucalyptus and tea tree\\noil are known for their antiseptic qualities and are fre-\\nquently used to disinfect sickrooms, and citronella and\\ngeranium can be useful in repelling insects.\\nDirect application\\nBecause of their potency, essential oils are diluted in a\\ncarrier oil or lotion before being applied to the skin to pre-\\nvent an allergic skin reaction. The carrier oil can be a veg-\\netable or olive based one, such as wheat germor avocado.\\nLight oils, such as safflower, sweet almond, grapeseed,\\nhazelnut,apricot seed, or peach kernel, may be absorbed\\nmore easily by the skin. Standard dilutions of essential oils\\nin carrier oils range from 2–10%. However, some oils can\\nbe used at higher concentrations, and others should be di-\\nluted further for safe and effective use. The type of carrier\\noil used and the therapeutic use of the application may also\\ninfluence how the essential oil is mixed. Individuals should\\nseek guidance from a healthcare professional and/or aro-\\nmatherapist when diluting essential oils.\\nMassage is a common therapeutic technique used in\\nconjunction with aromatherapy to both relax the body and\\nthoroughly administer the essential oil treatment. Essen-\\ntial oils can also be used in hot or cold compresses and\\nsoaks to treat muscle aches and pains (e.g., lavender and\\nginger). As a sore throat remedy, antiseptic and soothing\\nessential oils (e.g., tea tree and sage) can be thoroughly\\nmixed with water and used as a gargle or mouthwash.\\nInternal use\\nSome essential oils can be administered internally in\\ntincture, infusion, or suppository form to treat certain\\nsymptoms or conditions; however, this treatment should\\nnever be self-administered. Essential oils should only be\\ntaken internally under the supervision of a qualified\\nhealthcare professional.\\nAs non-prescription botanical preparations, the es-\\nsential oils used in aromatherapy are typically not paid\\nfor by health insurance. The self-administered nature of\\nthe therapy controls costs to some degree. Aromatherapy\\ntreatment sessions from a professional aromatherapist\\nare not covered by health insurance in most cases, al-\\nthough aromatherapy performed in conjunction with\\nphysical therapy, nursing, therapeutic massage, or other\\ncovered medical services may be covered. Individuals\\nshould check with their insurance provider to find out\\nabout their specific coverage.\\nThe adage “You get what you pay for” usually ap-\\nplies when purchasing essential oils, as bargain oils are\\noften adulterated, diluted, or synthetic. Pure essential\\noils can be expensive; and the cost of an oil will vary de-\\npending on its quality and availability.\\nPreparations\\nThe method of extracting an essential oil varies by\\nplant type. Common methods include water or steam dis-\\ntillation and cold pressing. Quality essential oils should be\\nunadulterated and extracted from pure botanicals. Many\\naromatherapy oils on the market are synthetic and/or dilut-\\ned, contain solvents, or are extracted from botanicals\\ngrown with pesticides or herbicides. To ensure best re-\\nsults, essential oils should be made from pure organic\\nbotanicals and labeled by their full botanical name.

If redness or irritation oc-\\ncurs, the oil should be diluted further and a second skin test\\nperformed, or it should be avoided altogether. Individuals\\nshould never apply undiluted essential oils to the skin unless\\nadvised to do so by a trained healthcare professional.\\nPrecautions\\nIndividuals should only take essential oils internally\\nunder the guidance and close supervision of a health care\\nprofessional. Some oils, such as eucalyptus,wormwood,\\nand sage, should never be taken internally. Many essential\\noils are highly toxic and should not be used at all in aro-\\nmatherapy. These include (but are not limited to) bitter al-\\nmond,pennyroyal, mustard,sassafras, rue, and mugwort.\\nCitrus-based essential oils, including bitter and\\nsweet orange, lime, lemon, grapefruit, and tangerine, are\\nphototoxic, and exposure to direct sunlight should be\\navoided for at least four hours after their application.\\nOther essential oils, such as cinnamon leaf, black\\npepper, juniper, lemon, white camphor, eucalyptus blue\\ngum, ginger, peppermint, pine needle, and thyme can be\\nextremely irritating to the skin if applied in high enough\\nconcentration or without a carrier oil or lotion. Caution\\nshould always be exercised when applying essential oils\\ntopically. Individuals should never apply undiluted es-\\nsential oils to the skin unless directed to do so by a\\ntrained healthcare professional and/or aromatherapist.\\nIndividuals taking homeopathic remedies should\\navoid black pepper, camphor, eucalyptus, and pepper-\\nmint essential oils. These oils may act as a remedy anti-\\ndote to the homeopathic treatment.\\nChildren should only receive aromatherapy treat-\\nment under the guidance of a trained aromatherapist or\\nhealthcare professional. Some essential oils may not be\\nappropriate for treating children, or may require addi-\\ntional dilution before use on children.\\nCertain essential oils should not be used by pregnant\\nor nursing women or by people with specific illnesses or\\nphysical conditions. Individuals suffering from any chron-\\nic or acute health condition should inform their healthcare\\nprovider before starting treatment with any essential oil.\\nAsthmatic individuals should not use steam inhala-\\ntion for aromatherapy, as it can aggravate their condition.\\nEssential oils are flammable, and should be kept\\naway from heat sources.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects vary by the type of essential oil used.\\nCitrus-based essential oils can cause heightened sensitiv-\\nity to sunlight. Essential oils may also cause contact\\ndermatitis, an allergic reaction characterized by redness\\nand irritation. Anyone experiencing an allergic reaction\\nto an essential oil should discontinue its use and contact\\ntheir healthcare professional for further guidance. Indi-\\nviduals should do a small skin patch test with new essen-\\ntial oils before using them extensively.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThe antiseptic and bactericidal qualities of some es-\\nsential oils (such as tea tree and peppermint) and their\\nvalue in fighting infection has been detailed extensively\\nin both ancient and modern medical literature.\\nRecent research in mainstream medical literature\\nhas also shown that aromatherapy has a positive psycho-\\nlogical impact on patients. Several clinical studies in-\\nvolving both post-operative and chronically ill subjects\\nshowed that massage with essential oils can be helpful in\\nimproving emotional well-being, and consequently, pro-\\nmoting the healing process.\\nToday, the use of holistic aromatherapy is widely ac-\\ncepted in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, where it\\nis commonly used in conjunction with massage as both a\\npsychological and physiological healing tool. In the\\nUnited States, where aromatherapy is often misunder-\\nstood as solely a cosmetic treatment, the mainstream\\nmedical community has been slower to accept its use.\\nTraining & certification\\nCertification or licensing is currently not required to\\nbecome an aromatherapist in the United States; however,\\nmany states require that healthcare professionals who\\npractice the “hands-on” therapies often used in conjunc-\\ntion with aromatherapy (e.g., massage) to be licensed.\\nThere are state-licensed educational institutions that\\noffer certificates and/or diplomas in aromatherapy train-\\ning.

It has also been popular for centuries\\nin the culinary arts and is still used in many American\\nkitchens as a thickening agent. While arrowroot is native\\nto Central America and widely cultivated in the West In-\\ndies, it can also be found growing in many tropical re-\\ngions of the world, including Southeast Asia, South\\nAfrica, Australia, and in Florida in the United States.\\nThe Latin genus Maranta was derived from the name of\\nan Italian doctor, Bartommeo Maranto.\\nArrowroot, which belongs to the Marantaceae plant\\nfamily, is widely considered an easily digested and nutri-\\ntious starch. The herb is extracted from the fleshy roots,\\ncalled rhizomes, of the arrowroot plant through an elabo-\\nrate process of washing, peeling, soaking, and drying in\\nthe sun. The end product is a fine, white powder with the\\nsame appearance and texture as cornstarch. Arrowroot is\\nvalued by herbalists primarily for its demulcent and an-\\ntidiarrheal properties. Exactly how it produces its thera-\\npeutic effects is not known. The chemical composition of\\nthe herb has not been thoroughly investigated.\\nWhile only Maranta arundinacea is considered true\\narrowroot, the common name for the herb is often ap-\\nplied to a variety of starches. These include other species\\nof Maranta, such as Maranta ramosissima , Maranta al-\\nlouya, Maranta nobilis , as well as Brazilian arrowroot\\n(Manihot utilissima or Manihot palmate ), Tahitian ar-\\nrowroot ( Tacca oceanica ), and East Indian arrowroot\\n(Curcuma augustifolia ). While some of these starches\\nmay be chemically similar to true arrowroot, it is not\\nclear if they produce the same medicinal effects. Con-\\nsumers interested in trying arrowroot are advised to\\nchoose Maranta arundinacea , which is sometimes re-\\nferred to as West Indian arrowroot or simply Maranta.\\nAs of 2000, much research is still required to deter-\\nmine if arrowroot can produce significant health benefits\\nsafely and effectively. The proper dosage of the herb has\\nalso yet to be determined.\\nGeneral use\\nWhile not approved by the United States Food and\\nDrug Administration (FDA), arrowroot is thought to\\nhave several beneficial effects. However, there is little\\nscientific evidence to support these claims. Today, the\\nherb is primarily used to soothe an uneasy stomach and\\nalleviate diarrhea or nausea and vomiting.

Gradual accumulations may result in diges-\\ntive disturbances,nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydra-\\ntion, coma, shock, convulsions, paralysis, and death.\\nCommon names for arsenicum album include ar-\\nsenic trioxide, white arsenic, white oxide of metallic ar-\\nsenic, and arsenius acid. Arsenic is indestructible, even\\nby fire, and remains in bone ash after cremation. It has\\nbeen used to create pigmentation for wallpaper, carpet,\\nand paints. Arsenic has also been used to produce medi-\\ncines and pesticides.\\nArsenic was used as a remedy for certain types of\\ncattle disease as far back as the eighth century. In the\\nseventeenth century, arsenic was applied topically to\\ntreat malignant ulcers and skin diseases in humans.\\nTaken internally, it was used to treat fevers. When fre-\\nquent and repeated doses of arsenic resulted in poisoning\\nand death, arsenic was pronounced unsafe for use. How-\\never, housewives and practitioners still used arsenic and\\nwere often successful in their treatments. Eventually ar-\\nsenic use was reinstated. Weak compounds of arsenic\\nwere often used to increase strength and endurance, rem-\\nedy anemia, and improve the skin and fur of animals. An\\nointment made from arsenic was used to treat cancerous\\ngrowths and tumors.\\nGeneral use\\nArsenicum album is one of the most frequently used\\nhomeopathic remedies and is one of the most well-\\nproven remedies. A polychrest with a wide field of ac-\\ntion, arsenicum album has the power to affect all parts of\\nthe human body.\\nArsenicum album is used to treat serious acute ail-\\nments, chronic diseases, and acute colds, bronchitis, and\\nfevers. Homeopaths prescribe this remedy to treat asthma,\\nanxiety disorders, panic attacks, skin infections, boils,\\nburns with blisters, cystitis, eye inflammations,chicken-\\npox, colds, coughs, indigestion, Crohn’s disease, herpes\\nsimplex, flu,insomnia, measles, mumps, sore throats,al-\\nlergies and hay fever, food poisoning , and fevers. Ar-\\nsenicum album has also been used to treat malarial and\\nseptic infections, alcoholism, syphilis, lupus, and cancer\\n(when applied in the early stages of the disease).\\nArsenicum album illnesses can be brought about by\\nthe use of quinine, tobacco, or alcohol, or from the sup-\\npression of skin eruptions, sweat, or mucous membrane\\ndischarges.\\nCommon characteristics\\nPeople requiring arsenicum album generally fit a\\nparticular profile. They are anxious, restless, weak, pale,\\nemaciated, faint, chilled, and catch colds easily. Their\\neyes are sunken and glassy; their faces is yellowish or\\nashy pale, and mouth, lips, and tongue are parched and\\ndry. They desire liquids in small, frequent amounts. The\\nforehead, face, chest, knees, hands, and feet are often\\ncold, so patients crave warmth. They may suffer from\\nburning, pressing pains throughout the entire body.\\nThese pains are aggravated by cold and reduced by heat.\\nWeakness is sudden and is reduced by lying down, al-\\nthough the other symptoms are worsened by it.\\nOther physical characteristics of this remedy include\\nburning, offensive, and watery discharges; palpitations;\\nprofuse, sour sweat; and a red-tipped tongue. There is a\\ntendency to bleed easily and from any place, and vomit-\\ning of blood and bleeding from lungs, throat, and mu-\\ncous membranes are not uncommon.\\nThe mental and emotional symptoms of the patient\\nprofile also include anxiety, nervousness, suspicion, im-\\npulsiveness, irritability, sadness, hopelessness, and de-\\npression. People requiring this remedy are often difficult\\npatients. They are critical and argumentative, easily of-\\nfended, easily startled, insecure, forgetful, sensitive to\\npain, and often suffer from delusions or hallucinations.\\nThey think their ailment is more serious than it is and de-\\nspair of ever getting well, often fearing that they are\\ngoing to die. They desire company and are afraid of\\nbeing alone. Patients may be unable to sleep due to their\\nrestlessness and anxiety or from physical discomforts\\nsuch as fever or cough. When they do sleep, they may\\nhave anxious dreams or nightmares. Even though they\\nare extremely weak, arsenicum album patients are clean\\nand tidy, partially to relieve their restlessness.\\nThe symptoms are aggravated by a change in tem-\\nperature, wet weather, cold food and drink, and by the\\nslightest exertion.

Custom Medical\\nStock Photo, Inc. Reproduced by permission.)\\nThe growing popularity of milieu therapies at psy-\\nchiatric institutions in the twentieth century was an im-\\nportant factor in the development of art therapy in the\\nUnited States. Milieu therapies (or environmental ther-\\napy) focus on putting the patient in a controlled thera-\\npeutic social setting that provides the patient with oppor-\\ntunities to gain self-confidence and interact with peers in\\na positive way. Activities that encourage self-discovery\\nand empowerment such as art, music, dance, and writing\\nare important components of this approach.\\nEducator and therapist Margaret Naumburg was a\\nfollower of both Freud and Jung, and incorporated art\\ninto psychotherapy as a means for her patients to visual-\\nize and recognize the unconscious. She founded the\\nWalden School in 1915, where she used students’ art-\\nworks in psychological counseling. She published exten-\\nsively on the subject and taught seminars on the tech-\\nnique at New York University in the 1950s. Today, she is\\nconsidered the founder of art therapy in the United States.\\nIn the 1930s, Karl, William, and Charles Menninger\\nintroduced an art therapy program at their Kansas-based\\npsychiatric hospital, the Menninger Clinic. The Men-\\nninger Clinic employed a number of artists in residence\\nin the following years, and the facility was also consid-\\nered a leader in the art therapy movement through the\\n1950s and 60s. Other noted art therapy pioneers who\\nemerged in the 50s and 60s include Edith Kramer, Hanna\\nYaxa Kwiatkowska (National Institute of Mental\\nHealth), and Janie Rhyne.\\nBenefits\\nArt therapy provides the client-artist with critical in-\\nsight into emotions, thoughts, and feelings. Key benefits\\nof the art therapy process include:\\n• Self-discovery. At its most successful, art therapy trig-\\ngers an emotional catharsis.\\n• Personal fulfillment. The creation of a tangible reward\\ncan build confidence and nurture feelings of self-worth.\\nPersonal fulfillment comes from both the creative and\\nthe analytical components of the artistic process.\\n• Empowerment. Art therapy can help people visually\\nexpress emotions and fears that they cannot express\\nthrough conventional means, and can give them some\\nsense of control over these feelings.\\n• Relaxation and stress relief. Chronic stress can be\\nharmful to both mind and body. Stress can weaken and\\ndamage the immune system, can cause insomnia and\\ndepression, and can trigger circulatory problems (like\\nhigh blood pressure and irregular heartbeats). When\\nused alone or in combination with other relaxation\\ntechniques such as guided imagery , art therapy can ef-\\nfectively relieve stress.\\n• Symptom relief and physical rehabilitation. Art therapy\\ncan also help patients cope with pain. This therapy can\\npromote physiological healing when patients identify and\\nwork through anger, resentment, and other emotional\\nstressors. It is often prescribed to accompany pain control\\ntherapy for chronically and terminally ill patients.\\nDescription\\nArt therapy, sometimes called expressive art or art\\npsychology, encourages self-discovery and emotional\\ngrowth. It is a two part process, involving both the cre-\\nation of art and the discovery of its meaning. Rooted in\\nFreud and Jung’s theories of the subconscious and un-\\nconscious, art therapy is based on the assumption that vi-\\nsual symbols and images are the most accessible and nat-\\nural form of communication to the human experience.\\nPatients are encouraged to visualize, and then create, the\\nthoughts and emotions that they cannot talk about. The\\nresulting artwork is then reviewed and its meaning inter-\\npreted by the patient.\\nThe “analysis” of the artwork produced in art thera-\\npy typically allows patients to gain some level of insight\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 131'),\n",

Art therapy is typically\\npracticed in conjunction with individual, group, or fami-\\nly psychotherapy (talk therapy). While a therapist may\\nprovide critical guidance for these activities, a key fea-\\nture of effective art therapy is that the patient/artist, not\\nthe therapist, directs the interpretation of the artwork.\\nArt therapy can be a particularly useful treatment\\ntool for children, who frequently have limited language\\nskills. By drawing or using other visual means to express\\ntroublesome feelings, younger patients can begin to ad-\\ndress these issues, even if they cannot identify or label\\nthese emotions with words. Art therapy is also valuable\\nfor adolescents and adults who are unable or unwilling to\\ntalk about thoughts and feelings.\\nBeyond its use in mental health treatment, art thera-\\npy is also used with traditional medicine to treat organic\\ndiseases and conditions. The connection between mental\\nand physical health is well documented, and art therapy\\ncan promote healing by relieving stress and allowing the\\npatient to develop coping skills.\\nArt therapy has traditionally centered on visual\\nmediums, like paintings, sculptures, and drawings. Some\\nmental healthcare providers have now broadened the def-\\ninition to include music, film, dance, writing, and other\\ntypes of artistic expression.\\nArt therapy is often one part of a psychiatric inpatient\\nor outpatient treatment program, and it can take place in\\nindividual or group therapy sessions. Group art therapy\\nsessions often take place in hospital, clinic, shelter, and\\ncommunity program settings. These group therapy ses-\\nsions can have the added benefits of positive social inter-\\naction, empathy, and support from peers. The client-artist\\ncan learn that others have similar concerns and issues.\\nPreparations\\nBefore starting art therapy, the therapist may have an\\nintroductory session with the client-artist to discuss art\\ntherapy techniques and give the client the opportunity to\\nask questions about the process. The client-artist’s comfort\\nwith the artistic process is critical to successful art therapy.\\nThe therapist ensures that appropriate materials and\\nspace are available for the client-artist, as well as an ade-\\nquate amount of time for the session. If the individual\\nartist is exploring art as therapy without the guidance of a\\ntrained therapist, adequate materials, space, and time are\\nstill important factors in a successful creative experience.\\nThe supplies used in art therapy are limited only by the\\nartist’s (and/or therapist’s) imagination. Some of the materi-\\nals often used include paper, canvas, poster board, assorted\\npaints, inks, markers, pencils, charcoals, chalks, fabrics,\\nstring, adhesives, clay, wood, glazes, wire, bendable metals,\\nand natural items (like shells, leaves, etc.). Providing artists\\nwith a variety of materials in assorted colors and textures\\ncan enhance their interest in the process and may result in a\\nricher, more diverse exploration of their emotions in the re-\\nsulting artwork. Such appropriate tools as scissors, brushes,\\nerasers, easels, supply trays, glue guns, smocks or aprons,\\nand cleaning materials are also essential.\\nAn appropriate workspace should be available for the\\ncreation of art. Ideally, this should be a bright, quiet, com-\\nfortable place, with large tables, counters, or other suitable\\nsurfaces. The space can be as simple as a kitchen or office\\ntable, or as fancy as a specialized artist’s studio.\\nThe artist should have adequate time to become\\ncomfortable with and explore the creative process. This\\nis especially true for people who do not consider them-\\nselves “artists” and may be uncomfortable with the con-\\ncept. If performed in a therapy group or one-on-one ses-\\nsion, the art therapist should be available to answer gen-\\neral questions about materials and/or the creative\\nprocess. However, the therapist should be careful not to\\ninfluence the creation or interpretation of the work.\\nPrecautions\\nArt materials and techniques should match the age\\nand ability of the client. People with impairments, such\\nas traumatic brain injury or an organic neurological con-\\ndition, may have difficulties with the self-discovery por-\\ntion of the art therapy process depending on their level of\\nfunctioning. However, they may still benefit from art\\ntherapy through the sensory stimulation it provides and\\nthe pleasure they get from artistic creation.\\nWhile art is accessible to all (with or without a ther-\\napist to guide the process), it may be difficult to tap the\\nfull potential of the interpretive part of art therapy with-\\nout a therapist to guide the process. When art therapy is\\nchosen as a therapeutic tool to cope with a physical con-\\ndition, it should be treated as a supplemental therapy and\\nnot as a substitute for conventional medical treatments.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nA wide body of literature supports the use of art\\ntherapy in a mental health capacity. And as the mind-\\nbody connection between psychological well-being and\\nphysical health is further documented by studies in the\\nfield, art therapy gains greater acceptance by mainstream\\nmedicine as a therapeutic technique for organic illness.\\nTraining & certification\\nBoth undergraduate and graduate art therapy pro-\\ngrams are offered at many accredited universities across\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2132\\nArt therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 132'),\n",

The\\nsmall evergreen grows in the frost-free drier parts of west-\\nern India, northern Africa, the Mediterranean, and the\\nMiddle East. Ashwaganda grows to a height of 2–3 ft\\n(about 1 m) and has oval leaves, showy yellow flowers,\\nand red, raisin-sized fruits. All parts of the plant, including\\nthe root, are used medicinally. Ashwaganda is also called\\nwinter cherry, withania, asgandh, and Indian ginseng.\\nGeneral use\\nAshwaganda is a major herb in the Ayurvedic sys-\\ntem of health and healing. Ayurvedic medicine is a sys-\\ntem of individualized healing derived from Hinduism\\nthat has been practiced in India for more than 2,000\\nyears. It is a complex system that recognizes different\\nhuman temperaments and body types. Each of these\\ntypes has different qualities that affect a person’s health\\nand natural balance.\\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, disease can result from any\\nof seven major categories of factors: heredity, congenital,\\ninternal, external trauma, seasonal, habits, or supernatur-\\nal factors. Disease can also be caused by misuse of the\\nfive senses: sight, touch, taste, hearing, and smell. Diag-\\nnoses are made through questioning, observation, exami-\\nnation, and interpretation. Health is restored by evaluat-\\ning the exact cause of the imbalance causing the disease\\nor condition and then prescribing herbs, exercises, diet\\nchanges and/or meditation to help restore the natural\\nbalance of body, mind, and spirit. Prescriptions are high-\\nly individualized, so that the same symptoms may re-\\nquire different remedies in different people.\\nAshwaganda is used to treat a great many different\\nconditions in Ayurvedic medicine. Every part of the plant\\nis used: leaves, fruit, flowers, and root. In addition, the\\nthe United States. Typical art therapy programs combine\\ncourses in art and psychology. The majority of these pro-\\ngrams meets or exceeds standards set by the American\\nArt Therapy Association (AATA).\\nThe Art Therapy Credentials Board (ATCB), a volun-\\ntary organization, grants the designation ATR (Art Thera-\\npist Registered) to professionals who have completed an\\napproved master’s level program of study in art therapy\\n(as described by the AATA) and have accumulated at least\\n1,000 hours of additional supervised clinical experience.\\nBoard certification is also available through the ATCB for\\nart therapists who have met the ATR requirements and\\nhave passed a certification exam (ATR-BC). Art therapists\\nwith the ATR-BC designation must complete continuing\\neducation credits to maintain their certification.\\nRegistration and/or certification is a recognition of\\nprofessional expertise, not a legal qualification or re-\\nquirement to practice. Professional licensing require-\\nments for art therapists vary by state. However, if the\\ntherapy is intended as a companion treatment to psycho-\\nlogical counseling or other mental health treatment, state\\nlicensing requirements typically apply. Where licensing\\nis a prerequisite to practice, a combination of education\\nand clinical experience, a written test, and continuing ed-\\nucation are required to maintain the license.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFausek, Diane.

In Hindi, the name of ashwaganda means “horse\\nsmell.” This name refers less to the herb’s odor than to a\\nhorse’s strength and health. Ashwaganda is supposed to\\nimpart that same horse-like strength to the people who\\nuse it.\\nAshwaganda is an adaptogen. Adaptogens are sub-\\nstances that non-specifically enhance and regulate the\\nbody’s ability to withstand stress and increase its general\\nperformance in ways that help the whole body resist dis-\\nease. Ashwaganda is celebrated as an adaptogen that will\\ndo all of the following:\\n• boost strength\\n• increase stamina and relieve fatigue\\n• enhance sexual energy and rejuvenate the body\\n• strengthen the immune system\\n• speed recovery from chronic illness\\n• strengthen sickly children\\n• soothe and calm without producing drowsiness\\n• clarify the mind and improve memory\\n• slow the aging process\\nThe powdered root of ashwaganda is normally used\\nfor whole body tonics that improve general health and well\\nbeing.

It is used to prevent infection in skin\\nwoundsand to treat skin diseases, including psoriasis ,\\nringworm, and scabies.\\nLaboratory studies\\nUniversity and medical researchers have been study-\\ning ashwaganda since at least the early 1960s. Chemical\\nanalysis shows that ashwaganda contains compounds\\nthought to have anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and anti-\\nfungal properties. Other compounds have been isolated\\nthat are associated with ashwaganda’s sedative and anti-\\nstress effects.\\nThe most rigorous laboratory tests have been done\\nin test tubes and on rats, mice, and other small laboratory\\nanimals. There is no proof that ashwaganda affects hu-\\nmans in the same way that it affects rodents. In animal\\nstudies, however, ashwaganda has been shown to have\\nconsistent anti-inflammatory, anti-fungal, anti-stress, and\\nsedative effects. In one well-known study, extracts of\\nashwaganda root were shown to significantly increase\\nthe swimming endurance of rats in a test that is consid-\\nered a classic stress test.\\nExperimenters have had mixed results in demon-\\nstrating anti-tumor and anti-cancer properties of ashwa-\\nganda. Many have found that extracts of ashwaganda\\nroot slow the growth of tumor cells in test-tube and\\nsmall-animal experiments, but these results have not yet\\nbeen reproduced in human subjects. Some researchers\\nreport that ashwaganda makes tumors more sensitive to\\nchemotherapy and radiation therapy without increasing\\nside effects caused by these therapies.\\nAlthough there is little doubt that ashwaganda con-\\ntains biologically active compounds that produce some\\nof the healing effects in humans that have been found in\\ntest-tube and small-animal studies, few controlled stud-\\nies using people have been done. One drawback to arriv-\\ning at conclusive evidence in humans is that most people\\ntake ashwaganda as part of a multi-herb tonic, making it\\ndifficult for researchers to attribute specific actions to\\nany one particular component of the formula. Scientific\\ninterest in ashwaganda is high, and laboratory studies\\ncontinue to be performed.\\nPreparations\\nAshwaganda is available in many forms, including\\npowders, decoctions, essential oil, tinctures, and teas\\nmade from the root, root bark, and the leaves. Commer-\\ncially ashwaganda is available as capsules. The usual cap-\\nsule dosage is 300 mg of powdered root, taken once or\\ntwice a day. Tincture dosage is often 2–4 ml (0.5–1 tsp)\\ndaily. Ashwaganda tea can be made by boiling the roots\\nfor about 15 minutes. Three cups a day is recommended.\\nThe fruit is often chewed to assist in convalescence from\\nprolonged illness. These are simply representative doses\\nand uses, since Ayurvedic medicine is highly individual-\\nized. The dose recommended depends on both the body\\ntype of the person and the nature of his or her illness.\\nPrecautions\\nAshwaganda is not recommended for use by pregnant\\nwomen. Thousands of years of use have shown that this\\nplant is quite safe. On the other hand, laboratory tests indi-\\ncate that rats given high levels of ashwaganda root extract\\ndevelop kidney lesions. This effect has not been seen in\\nhumans, but using the herb in moderation may be prudent.\\nAshwaganda has a sedative effect on the central ner-\\nvous system. It will enhance the effect of any other cen-\\ntral nervous system sedatives (e.g., barbiturates or alco-\\nhol) that are taken at the same time.

This inflammation periodically causes\\nthe airways to narrow, producing wheezing and breath-\\nlessness sometimes to the point where the patient gasps\\nfor air. This obstruction of the air flow either stops spon-\\ntaneously or responds to a wide range of treatments.\\nContinuing inflammation makes asthmatics hyper-re-\\nsponsive to such stimuli as cold air,exercise, dust, pollu-\\ntants in the air, and even stress or anxiety.\\nDescription\\nBetween 16 and 17 million Americans have asthma\\nand the number has been rising since 1980. As many as 9\\nmillion U.S. children under age 18 may have asthma.\\nBlacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and Alaskan na-\\ntives had higher rates of asthma-control problems than\\nwhites or Asians in the United States.\\nThe changes that take place in the lungs of asthmat-\\nics make their airways (the bronchi and the smaller bron-\\nchioles) hyper-reactive to many different types of stimuli\\nthat do not affect healthy lungs. In an asthma attack, the\\nmuscle tissue in the walls of the bronchi go into spasm,\\nand the cells that line the airways swell and secrete\\nmucus into the air spaces. Both these actions cause the\\nbronchi to narrow, a change that is called bronchocon-\\nstriction. As a result, an asthmatic person has to make a\\nmuch greater effort to breathe.\\nCells in the bronchial walls, called mast cells, release\\ncertain substances that cause the bronchial muscle to con-\\ntract and stimulate mucus formation. These substances,\\nwhich include histamine and a group of chemicals called\\nleukotrienes, also bring white blood cells into the area.\\nMany patients with asthma are prone to react to substances\\nsuch as pollen, dust, or animal dander; these are called al-\\nlergens. Many people with asthma do not realize that aller-\\ngens are triggering their attacks. On the other hand, asthma\\nalso affects many patients who are not allergic in this way.\\nAsthma usually begins in childhood or adolescence,\\nbut it also may first appear in adult life.

When asthma begins\\nin childhood, it often does so in a child who is likely, for\\ngenetic reasons, to become sensitized to common aller-\\ngens in the environment. Such a child is known as an\\natopic person. In 2004, scientists in Helsinki, Finland,\\nidentified two new genes that cause atopic asthma. The\\ndiscovery might lead to earlier prediction of asthma in\\nchildren and adults. When these children are exposed to\\ndust, animal proteins, fungi, or other potential allergens,\\nthey produce a type of antibody that is intended to engulf\\nand destroy the foreign materials. This has the effect of\\nmaking the airway cells sensitive to particular materials.\\nFurther exposure can lead rapidly to an asthmatic re-\\nsponse. This condition of atopy is present in at least one\\nthird and as many as one half of the general population.\\nWhen an infant or young child wheezes during viral in-\\nfections, the presence of allergy (in the child or a close\\nrelative) is a clue that asthma may well continue\\nthroughout childhood.\\nAllergenic materials may also play a role when\\nadults become asthmatic. Asthma can start at any age\\nand in a wide variety of situations. Many adults who are\\nnot allergic have such conditions as sinusitis or nasal\\npolyps, or they may be sensitive to aspirin and related\\ndrugs. Another major source of adult asthma is exposure\\nat work to animal products, certain forms of plastic,\\nwood dust, metals, and environmental pollution.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIn most cases, asthma is caused by inhaling an aller-\\ngen that sets off the chain of biochemical and tissue\\nchanges leading to airway inflammation, bronchocon-\\nstriction, and wheezing. Because avoiding (or at least\\nminimizing) exposure is the most effective way of treat-\\ning asthma, it is vital to identify which allergen or irri-\\ntant is causing symptoms in a particular patient. Once\\nasthma is present, symptoms can be set off or made\\nworse if the patient also has rhinitis (inflammation of\\nthe lining of the nose) or sinusitis. When, for some rea-\\nson, stomach acid passes back up the esophagus in a re-\\naction called acid reflux, this condition also can make\\nasthma worse. In addition, a viral infection of the respi-\\nratory tract can inflame an asthmatic reaction. Aspirin\\nand drugs called beta-blockers, often used to treat high\\nblood pressure, also can worsen the symptoms of asth-\\nma. But the most important inhaled allergens giving rise\\nto attacks of asthma are:\\n• animal dander\\n• dust mites\\n• fungi (molds) that grow indoors\\n• cockroach allergens\\n• pollen\\n• occupational exposure to chemicals, fumes, or particles\\nof industrial materials\\n• tobacco smoke\\n• air pollutants\\nIn addition, there are three important factors that\\nregularly produce attacks in certain asthmatic patients,\\nand they may sometimes be the sole cause of symptoms.\\nThey are:\\n• inhaling cold air (cold-induced asthma)\\n• exercise-induced asthma (in certain children, asthma\\nattacks are caused simply by exercising)\\n• stress or a high level of anxiety\\nWheezing often is obvious, but mild asthmatic at-\\ntacks may be confirmed when the physician listens to the\\npatient’s chest with a stethoscope. Besides wheezing and\\nbeing short of breath, the patient may cough or report a\\nfeeling of tightness in the chest. Children may have itch-\\ning on their back or neck at the start of an attack. Wheez-\\ning often is loudest when the patient exhales. Some asth-\\nmatics are free of symptoms most of the time but may\\noccasionally be short of breath for a brief time. Others\\nspend much of their days (and nights) coughing and\\nwheezing until properly treated. Crying or even laughing\\nmay bring on an attack. Severe episodes often are seen\\nwhen the patient gets a viral respiratory tract infection or\\nis exposed to a heavy load of an allergen or irritant.\\nAsthmatic attacks may last only a few minutes or can go\\non for hours or even days. Being short of breath may\\ncause a patient to become very anxious, sit upright, lean\\nforward, and use the muscles of the neck and chest wall\\nto help breathe. The patient may be able to say only a\\nfew words at a time before stopping to take a breath.\\nConfusion and a bluish tint to the skin are clues that the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 137\\nAsthma\\nAir pollutants\\nAnimal dander\\nCockroach allergens\\nDust mites\\nIndoor fungi (molds)\\nOccupational allergens such as chemicals, fumes,\\nparticles of industrial materials\\nPollen\\nINHALED ALLERGENS\\nMOST OFTEN TRIGGERING ASTHMA ATTACKS\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 137'),\n",

If the diagnosis is still in doubt, the patient can\\ninhale a suspect allergen while using a spirometer to\\ndetect airway narrowing. Spirometry also can be re-\\npeated after a bout of exercise if exercise-induced asth-\\nma is a possibility. A chest x-ray will help rule out\\nother disorders.\\nTreatment\\nThere are many alternative treatments available for\\nasthma that have shown promising results. One strong\\nargument for these treatments is that they try to avoid\\nthe drugs that allopathic treatment (combating disease\\nwith remedies to produce effects different from those\\nproduced by the disease) relies upon, which can be toxic\\nand addictive. Mainstream journals have reported on the\\ntoxicity of asthma pharmaceuticals. A 1995 New\\nZealand study showed that before 1940, death from\\nasthma was very low, but that the death rate promptly\\nincreased with the introduction of bronchodilators. The\\nNew England Journal of Medicinein 1992 reported that\\nalbuterol and other asthma drugs cause the lungs to de-\\nteriorate when used regularly. A 1989 study in the An-\\nnals of Internal Medicine showed that respiratory thera-\\npists, who are exposed to bronchodilator sprays, devel-\\nop asthma five times more often than other healthcare\\nprofessionals, which could imply that the drugs them-\\nselves may induce asthma. Theophylline, another popu-\\nlar drug, has been reported to cause personality changes\\nin users. Steroids can also have negative effects on\\nmany systems in the body, particularly the hormonal\\nsystem. Thus, natural and non-toxic methods for treat-\\ning asthma are the preferred first choice of alternative\\npractitioners, while drugs are used to manage extreme\\ncases and emergencies.\\nAlternative medicine tends to view asthma as the\\nbody’s protective reaction to environmental agents and\\npollutants. As such, the treatment goal is often to restore\\nbalance to and strengthen the entire body and provide spe-\\ncific support to the lungs, immune and hormonal systems.\\nAsthma sufferers can help by keeping a diary of asthma\\nattacks in order to determine environmental and emotional\\nfactors that may be contributing to their condition.\\nAlternative treatments have minimal side effects, are\\ngenerally inexpensive, and are convenient forms of self-\\ntreatment. They also can be used alongside allopathic\\ntreatments to improve their effectiveness and lessen their\\nnegative side effects.\\nDietary and nutritional therapies\\nSome alternative practitioners recommend cutting\\ndown on or eliminating dairy products from the diet, as\\noxygen supply is much too low and that emergency treat-\\nment is needed. In a severe attack, some of the air sacs in\\nthe lung may rupture so that air collects within the chest,\\nwhich makes it even harder to breathe. The good news is\\nthat almost always, even patients with the most severe at-\\ntacks will recover completely.\\nDiagnosis\\nApart from listening to the patient’s chest, the exam-\\niner should look for maximum chest expansion while\\ntaking in air. Hunched shoulders and contracting neck\\nmuscles are other signs of narrowed airways. Nasal\\npolyps or increased amounts of nasal secretions are often\\nnoted in asthmatic patients. Skin changes, like dermati-\\ntis or eczema, are a clue that the patient has allergic\\nproblems. Inquiring about a family history of asthma or\\nallergiescan be a valuable indicator of asthma. A test\\ncalled spirometry measures how rapidly air is exhaled\\nand how much is retained in the lungs. Repeating the test\\nafter the patient inhales a drug that widens the air pas-\\nsages (a bronchodilator) will show whether the narrow-\\ning of the airway is reversible, which is a very typical\\nfinding in asthma. Often patients use a related instru-\\nment, called a peak flow meter, to keep track of asthma\\nseverity when at home.\\nFrequently, it is difficult to determine what is trig-\\ngering asthma attacks. Allergy skin testing may be\\nused, although an allergic skin response does not al-\\nways mean that the allergen being tested is causing the\\nasthma. Also, the body’s immune system produces an\\nantibody to fight off the allergen, and the amount of an-\\ntibody can be measured by a blood test.

It contains ephedrine,\\nwhich is a bronchodilator used in many drugs. However,\\nthe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a\\nban on the sale of ephedra that took effect in April 2004\\nbecause it was shown to raise blood pressure and stress\\nthe circulatory system, resulting in heart attacks and\\nstrokes for some users. Ginkgo has been shown to reduce\\nthe frequency of asthma attacks, and licorice is used in\\nChinese medicine as a natural decongestant and expecto-\\nrant. There are many formulas used in traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine to prevent or ease asthma attacks, de-\\npending on the specific Chinese diagnosis given by the\\npractitioner. For example, ma huang is used to treat so-\\ncalled “wind-cold” respiratory ailments.\\nOther herbs used for asthma include lobelia, also\\ncalled Indian tobacco; nettle, which contains a natural\\nantihistamine; thyme; elecampane mullein : feverfew;\\npassionflower: saw palmetto: and Asian ginseng. Coffee\\nand tea have been shown to reduce the severity of asthma\\nattacks because caffeine works as a bronchodilator. Tea\\nalso contains minute amounts of theophylline, a major\\ndrug used for asthma. Ayurvedic (traditional East Indian)\\nmedicine recommends the herb Tylophora asthmatica.\\nMind/body approaches\\nMind/body medicine has demonstrated that psy-\\nchological factors play a complex role in asthma. Emo-\\ntional stress can trigger asthma attacks. Mind/body tech-\\nniques strive to reduce stress and help asthma sufferers\\nmanage the psychological component of their condition.\\nA 1992 study by Dr. Erik Peper at the Institute for Holis-\\ntic Healing Studies in San Francisco used biofeedback,\\na treatment method that uses monitors to reveal physio-\\nlogical information to patients, to teach relaxation and\\ndeep breathing methods to 21 asthma patients. Eighty\\npercent of them subsequently reported fewer attacks and\\nemergency room visits. A 1993 study by Kaiser Perma-\\nnente in Northern California worked with 323 adults\\nwith moderate to severe asthma. Half the patients got\\nstandard care while the other half participated in support\\ngroups. The support group patients had cut their asthma-\\nrelated doctor visits in half after two years. Some other\\nmind/body techniques used for asthma include relax-\\nation methods,meditation , hypnotherapy ,, mental\\nimaging, psychotherapy, and visualization.\\nYoga and breathing methods\\nStudies have shown that yoga significantly helps\\nasthma sufferers, with exercises specifically designed to\\nexpand the lungs, promote deep breathing, and reduce\\nstress. Pranayama is the yogic science of breathing,\\nwhich includes hundreds of deep breathing techniques.\\nThese breathing exercises should be done daily as part of\\nany treatment program for asthma, as they are a very ef-\\nfective and inexpensive measure.\\nControlled exercise\\nMany people believe that those with asthma should\\nnot exercise. This is particularly true among parents of\\nchildren with asthma. In a 2004 study, researchers re-\\nported that 20% of children with asthma do not get\\nenough exercise. Many parents believe it is dangerous\\nfor their children with asthma to exercise, but physical\\nactivity benefits all children, including those with asth-\\nma. Parents should work with the child’s healthcare\\nprovider and any coach or organized sport leader to care-\\nfully monitor his or her activities.\\nAcupuncture\\nAcupuncture can be an effective treatment for asth-\\nma. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine along with\\ndietary changes. Acupressure can also be used as a self-\\ntreatment for asthma attacks and prevention. The Lung 1\\npoints, used to stimulate breathing, can be easily found\\non the chest. These are sensitive, often knotted spots on\\nthe muscles that run horizontally about an inch below the\\ncollarbone, and about two inches from the center of the\\nchest. The points can be pressed in a circular manner\\nwith the thumbs, while the head is allowed to hang for-\\nward and the patient takes slow, deep breaths. Reflexolo-\\ngy also uses particular acupressure points on the hands\\nand feet that are believed to stimulate the lungs.\\nOther treatments\\nAromatherapists recommend eucalyptus, lavender,\\nrosemary , and chamomile as fragrances that promote\\nfree breathing. In Japan, a common treatment for asthma\\nis administering cold baths.

The goals are to prevent trou-\\nblesome symptoms, to maintain lung function as close to\\nnormal as possible, and to allow patients to pursue their\\nnormal activities, including those requiring exertion. The\\nbest drug therapy is that which controls asthmatic symp-\\ntoms while causing few or no side effects.\\nDrugs\\nThe chief methylxanthine drug is theophylline. It\\nmay exert some anti-inflammatory effect and is especial-\\nly helpful in controlling nighttime symptoms of asthma.\\nWhen, for some reason, a patient cannot use an inhaler\\nto maintain long-term control, sustained-release theo-\\nphylline is a good alternative. The blood levels of the\\ndrug must be measured periodically, as too high a dose\\ncan cause an abnormal heart rhythm or convulsions.\\nBeta-receptor agonists (drugs that trigger cell re-\\nsponse) are bronchodilators. They are the drugs of\\nchoice for relieving sudden attacks of asthma and for\\npreventing attacks from being triggered by exercise.\\nSome agonists, such as albuterol, act mainly in lung cells\\nand have little effect on the heart and other organs. These\\ndrugs generally start acting within minutes, but their ef-\\nfects last only four to six hours. They may be taken by\\nmouth, inhaled, or injected. In 2004, a new lower con-\\ncentration of albuterol was approved by the FDA for\\nchildren ages two to 12.\\nSteroids are drugs that resemble natural body hor-\\nmones. They block inflammation and are effective in re-\\nlieving symptoms of asthma. When steroids are taken by\\ninhalation for a long period, asthma attacks become less\\nfrequent as the airways become less sensitive to aller-\\ngens. Steroids are the strongest medicine for asthma, and\\ncan control even severe cases over the long term and\\nmaintain good lung function. However, steroids can\\ncause numerous side effects, including bleeding from the\\nstomach, loss of calcium from bones, cataracts in the\\neye, and a diabetes-like state. Patients using steroids for\\nlengthy periods may also have problems with wound\\nhealing, may gain weight, and may suffer mental prob-\\nlems. In children, growth may be slowed. Besides being\\ninhaled, steroids may be taken by mouth or injected, to\\nrapidly control severe asthma.\\nLeukotriene modifiers are among a newer type of\\ndrug that can be used in place of steroids, for older chil-\\ndren or adults who have a mild degree of persistent asth-\\nma. They work by counteracting leukotrienes, which are\\nsubstances released by white blood cells in the lung that\\ncause the air passages to constrict and promote mucus\\nsecretion. Other drugs include cromolyn and ne-\\ndocromil, which are anti-inflammatory drugs that often\\nare used as initial treatments to prevent long-term asth-\\nmatic attacks in children. Montelukast sodium (Singu-\\nlair) is a drug taken daily that is used to help prevent\\nasthma attacks rather than to treat an acute attack. In\\n2004, the FDA approved an oral granule formula of Sin-\\ngulair for young children.\\nIf a patient’s asthma is caused by an allergen that\\ncannot be avoided and it has been difficult to control\\nsymptoms by drugs, immunotherapy may be worth try-\\ning. In a typical course of immunotherapy, increasing\\namounts of the allergen are injected over a period of\\nthree to five years, so that the body can build up an effec-\\ntive immune response. There is a risk that this treatment\\nmay itself cause the airways to become narrowed and\\nbring on an asthmatic attack. Not all experts are enthusi-\\nastic about immunotherapy, although some studies have\\nshown that it reduces asthmatic symptoms caused by ex-\\nposure to dust mites, ragweed pollen, and cats.\\nManaging asthmatic attacks\\nA severe asthma attack should be treated as quickly\\nas possible. It is most important for a patient suffering an\\nacute attack to be given extra oxygen. Rarely, it may be\\nnecessary to use a mechanical ventilator to help the pa-\\ntient breathe. A beta-receptor agonist is inhaled repeated-\\nly or continuously. If the patient does not respond\\npromptly and completely, a steroid is given. A course of\\nsteroid therapy, given after the attack is over, will make a\\nrecurrence less likely.\\nLong-term allopathic treatment for asthma is based\\non inhaling a beta-receptor agonist using a special in-\\nhaler that meters the dose. Patients must be instructed in\\nproper use of an inhaler to be sure that it will deliver the\\nright amount of drug. Once asthma has been controlled\\nfor several weeks or months, it is worth trying to cut\\ndown on drug treatment, but this tapering must be done\\ngradually. The last drug added should be the first to be\\nreduced. Patients should be seen every one to six\\nmonths, depending on the frequency of attacks. Starting\\ntreatment at home, rather than in a hospital, makes for\\nminimal delay and helps the patient to gain a sense of\\ncontrol over the disease. All patients should be taught\\nhow to monitor their symptoms so that they will know\\nwhen an attack is starting. Those with moderate or se-\\nvere asthma should know how to use a flow meter. They\\nalso should have a written plan to follow if symptoms\\nsuddenly become worse, including how to adjust their\\nmedication and when to seek medical help. If more in-\\ntense treatment is necessary, it should be continued for\\nseveral days. When deciding whether a patient should be\\nhospitalized, the physician must take into account the pa-\\ntient’s past history of acute attacks, severity of symp-\\ntoms, current medication, and the availability of good\\nsupport at home.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 141\\nAsthma\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 141'),\n",

Odle\\nAstigmatism\\nDefinition\\nAstigmatism is a problem of visual distortion caused\\nby a misshapen cornea. The cornea acts as a focusing\\nlens for the eye. If the cornea does not have the proper\\nshape, the eye is unable to properly focus an image.\\nMost people have a certain degree of astigmatism. Cor-\\nrective measures are necessary only in cases where the\\ndistortion is severe.\\nDescription\\nLight rays entering a normal eye come to a point of\\nfocus on the retina through a transparent, dome-shaped\\nlayer called the cornea. In astigmatism there is unequal\\ncurvature of the cornea, and the light rays come to focus at\\nmore than one point on the retina. This causes the person\\nto see a blurred or doubled image. Astigmatism is usually\\npresent at birth and may increase during childhood as the\\neye tissue develops. Usually the degree of astigmatism re-\\nmains fairly constant throughout adulthood.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIt is unknown why some people develop a mis-\\nshapen cornea. It is possible that astigmatism is an inher-\\nited trait. Factors such as stress, continual reading in dim\\nlighting, or excessive close-up work may also contribute\\nto the development of astigmatism. It is sometimes\\ncaused by pressure from chalazion, a condition that\\ncauses the eyelid to swell; from scars on the cornea; or\\nfrom keratoconus, a condition that involves swelling of\\nthe cornea. The main symptom of astigmatism is blurred\\nor distorted vision. There may also be a history of\\nheadaches, eye strain,fatigue, and double vision.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe standard eye examination with a refraction\\ntest, given by an optometrist or opthalmologist, is\\nused to determine the presence of astigmatism. An in-\\nstrument called a keratometer is used to measure the\\ncornea and calculate the shape of the required correc-\\ntive lens.\\nTreatment\\nThe Bates method or other type of visual training\\nmay be helpful in improving vision and reducing symp-\\ntoms. The homeopathic remedies Ruta graveolens (from\\ncommon rue) and Apis mellifica (from the honey bee)\\ncan be used to relieve eyestrain, one of the main symp-\\ntoms and possible contributors to astigmatism.\\nAcupuncture treatment or Traditional Chinese\\nMedicine may help, as the liver system is connected to\\neye functions. Certain treatments can strengthen and\\ncorrect the skewing of the Liver qi. (Qi is the flow of\\nenergy in the body. It is sometimes associated with cer-\\ntain organs.)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 143\\nAstigmatism\\nCornea\\nLens\\nLight\\nRetina\\nHorizontal line out of focus\\nAstigmatism corrected by lens\\nLight\\nAstigmatism can be treated by the use of cylindrical lenses.\\nThe lenses are shaped to counteract the shape of the sec-\\ntions of the cornea that are causing the difficulty.(Illustra-\\ntion by Electronic Illustrators Group.)\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 143'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='Allopathic treatment\\nAstigmatism can be most simply treated with either\\neyeglasses or contact lenses. The lenses are made so as\\nto counteract the shape of the sections of cornea that are\\ncausing difficulty. Contact lenses that are used to correct\\nastigmatism are called toric lenses. Hard contact lenses\\nmay be better for correcting astigmatism than soft con-\\ntact lenses. In the case of keratoconus, a corneal trans-\\nplant is performed if the astigmatism cannot be corrected\\nwith hard contact lenses.\\nRefractive surgery can be performed to correct the\\ncurvature of the cornea. In radial keratotomy (RK) for\\nastigmatism, cuts are made into the cornea with a dia-\\nmond blade instrument. In photorefractive keratectomy\\n(PRK), a laser is used to improve the shape of the cornea\\nby removing micro-thin slices. Laser assisted in situ ker-\\natomileusis (LASIK) is the most recently developed type\\nof refractive surgery. A flap of the cornea is cut with a\\nlaser and then the corneal tissue underneath is shaved to\\nimprove the shape.\\nDoctors continue to improve LASIK techniques. In\\n2002, a cross-cylinder method was developed in refrac-\\ntive surgery to help treat mixed astigmatism, one of the\\nmost difficult types to treat. Refractive surgery requires\\na high level of expertise. Anyone considering it should\\nmake sure that the surgeon has a lot of experience in\\nthe procedure. There should also be an in-depth discus-\\nsion of the possible side effects and risks of the proce-\\ndure. For instance, patients with flatter corneas seem to\\ncome out of surgery with more light distortion than\\nthose with curved corneas. Pupil size also may affect\\nsurgery outcome.\\nExpected results\\nEffects of astigmatism can generally be greatly im-\\nproved with eyeglasses or contact lenses. Refractive\\nsurgery may diminish the need for lenses or make them\\nunecessary altogether. The major risks of surgery include\\nchronic visual problems, injury to the eye tissue, infec-\\ntion, and over- or under-correction, which would still\\nleave some astigmatism. Complications may require the\\nuse of medication or further surgery.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLininger, Skye, ed. The Natural Pharmacy. Rocklin, Calif.:\\nPrima Health, 1998.\\nNewell, Frank W.

In 1968 she suffered injuries from\\ntwo automobile accidents. In seeking relief from pain,\\nshe met Dr. Ida Rolf, the innovator of Rolfing. When\\nAston recovered from her injuries, Rolf asked her to de-\\nvelop a movement education program that would com-\\nplement the gains achieved with rolfing. She worked\\nwith Rolf in creating this program from 1971 to 1977.\\nBy 1977 Aston and Rolf’s interests and views of\\nbodywork had diverged. Aston left Rolf and established\\nher own techniques, which she called Aston-Patterning.\\nShe has also developed a special program for older peo-\\nple called the Aston-Patterning Fitness Program for Se-\\nniors. Today Aston-Patterning is a registered trademark\\nof the Aston Paradigm Corporation of which Judith\\nAston is the director.\\nBenefits\\nAston-Patterning assists people in finding more effi-\\ncient and less stressful ways of performing the simple\\nmovements of everyday life to dissipate tension in the\\nbody. This is done through massage, alteration of the en-\\nvironment, and fitness training.\\nDescription\\nSeeking to solve movement problems, Aston-Pat-\\nterning helps make the most of their own unique body\\ntypes rather than trying to force them to conform to an\\nideal. Unlike Rolfing, it doesn’t strive for linear symme-\\ntry. Rather it works with asymmetry in the human body\\nto develop patterns of alignment and movement that feel\\nright to the individual. Aston also introduced the idea of\\nworking in a three-dimensional spinal pattern.\\nAston-Patterning sessions have four general compo-\\nnents. They are:\\n• A personal history that helps the practitioner assess the\\nclient’s needs.\\n• Pre-testing, in which the practitioner and the client explore\\npatterns of movement and potential for improvement.\\n• Movement education and bodywork, including mas-\\nsage, myofacial release, and arthrokinetics, to help re-\\nlease tension and make new movement patterns easier.\\n• Post-testing, when pre-testing movements are repeated,\\nallowing the client to feel the changes that have taken\\nplace and integrate them into daily life.\\nAston-Patterning requires more participation from\\nthe client than many bodywork techniques. The massage\\naspect of Aston-Patterning is designed around a three-di-\\nmensional, non-compressive touch that releases patterns\\nof tension in the body. It is gentler than Rolfing. Myoki-\\nnetics uses touch to release tension in the face and neck.\\nArthrokinetics addresses tension at bones and joints.\\nThis massage is accompanied by education about the es-\\ntablishment of new movement patterns.\\nIn addition to Aston-Patterning sessions, clients are\\nalso helped to examine their environment for factors, such\\nas seating or sleeping arrangements, that may limit their\\nbody function and introduce tension. Finally, they may\\nchoose to participate in the Aston fitness training program\\nthat includes loosening techniques based on self-massage,\\ntoning, stretching, and cardiovascular fitness.\\nPreparations\\nSince clients typically work with an Aston-Pattern-\\ning practitioner for extended periods of time, it is impor-\\ntant that they feel comfortable with their specific practi-\\ntioner. Certified Aston practitioners recommend that\\nprospective clients make a get-acquainted visit before\\nenrolling in a course of treatment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 145\\nAston-Patterning\\nJudith Aston was born in Long Beach, California.\\nShe graduated from University of California at Los An-\\ngeles with a B.A. and a M.F.A. in dance. Her interest in\\nmovement arose from working as a dancer. In 1963\\nAston established her first movement education pro-\\ngram for dancers, actors, and athletes at Long Beach\\nCity College.\\nFive years later, while recovering from injuries sus-\\ntained during two consecutive automobile accidents,\\nAston met Ida Rolf, the developer of rolfing. Aston\\nbegan working for Rolf, teaching a movement educa-\\ntion program called Rolf-Aston Structural Patterning that\\nemphasized using the body with minimum effort and\\nmaximum precision.\\nIn time, Rolf and Aston’s views on movement di-\\nverged, and the partnership was dissolved in 1977.\\nAston formed her own company called the Aston Para-\\ndigm Corporation in Lake Tahoe, California. This com-\\npany provides training and certification for Aston practi-\\ntioners. She also began exploring how environmental\\nconditions affect body movement, foreshadowing the\\nergonomic movement in the workplace that developed\\nin the 1990s. Over time, Aston has expanded her move-\\nment work to include a fitness program for older adults.\\nToday, Judith Aston serves as director of Aston Paradigm\\nCorporation.\\nTish Davidson\\nJUDITH ASTON ?–\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 145'),\n",

This perennial grows to a height of 2–4\\nft. (5–10 cm). It has white or yellow flowers and leaves\\nwith 10–18 pairs of leaflets. The large yellow taproots of\\nfour- to seven-year-old plants are used for medicinal pur-\\nposes. Although there are many varieties in the Astra-\\ngalus family, Astragalus membranaceus is the sole medi-\\ncinal type. The plant is found only in the grasslands and\\nmountains of central and western Asia, principally in\\nChina, Taiwan, and Korea. Astragalus is a good source of\\nselenium, an antioxidant and immune system stimulant.\\nGeneral use\\nAstragalus is called Huang Qi in traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine (TCM) and is considered to be an im-\\nportant tonic herb. It is used to strengthen what is\\ncalled the wei qi , or the defensive energy of the body\\nagainst disease. TCM identifies astragalus as being\\nhelpful in conditions involving the Spleen, the Lungs,\\nand the Triple Burner. It is a warming tonic, and it im-\\nproves the functioning of the qi (the flow of energy in\\nthe body), the Spleen, the Blood, and the fluids of the\\nbody. Astragalus is recommended for Spleen deficien-\\ncy symptoms, such as diarrhea , fatigue , sweating,\\nand lack of appetite. It is used as a tonic for the Lungs\\nand is good for shortness of breath,asthma , and\\nchronic lung problems. Astragalus is prescribed for\\narthritis, diarrhea, and nervous symptoms. It is often\\ngiven to people who are in a state of generally poor or\\nweakened health.\\nAstragalus is classified as an adaptogen, an herb that\\nincreases the body’s endurance and resistance to a wide\\narray of physical, chemical, and biological stressors.\\nAdaptogens help normalize the functioning of various\\nbody systems by affecting the action of hormones. Adap-\\ntogens are usually beneficial in treating chronic condi-\\ntions. They have been found to enhance the immune re-\\nsponse, reduce inflammation, stabilize blood sugar, and\\nsupport the hormone systems, particularly the adrenal\\nand pituitary glands. Adaptogens should be used for an\\nextended period of time—at least six weeks.\\nAstragalus helps the body function at its best\\nlevel. It helps the body deal with stress and enhances\\noverall immune function. It has been shown to stimu-\\nlate production and activation of the white blood cells,\\nwhich fight infection. It is highly recommended for\\npreventing and alleviating colds and flu. Astragalus\\ncan be used to cure chronic weaknesses of the lungs.\\nBecause it improves blood circulation and heart func-\\ntion, astragalus is useful in treating heart disease . It\\nhas also been found to prevent or reduce blood clot-\\nting. Astragalus can be taken as a tonic for the kidneys.\\nIt has a diuretic (urine-producing) effect and so it\\nflushes out the urinary system. It is thus very effective\\nin treating kidney infections , proteinuria (too much\\nprotein in the urine), chronic prostate problems, and\\nchronic urinary tract problems.\\nAstragalus is helpful to those taking chemotherapy\\nand radiation treatments. It reduces toxic side effects and\\nenhances therapeutic effects. Cancer patients who take\\nastragalus during or after cancer treatments tend to re-\\ncover more quickly from the ill effects of the treatment,\\nand they generally have better survival rates. This ap-\\npears to be connected with the strengthening of the im-\\nmune system. Astragalus also stimulates the adrenal\\nglands, whose functions are suppressed in cancer. The\\nherb improves poor appetite, diarrhea, weakness, wast-\\ning, and night sweats. This makes it helpful for cancer\\npatients as well as AIDS sufferers and those with other\\ndebilitating diseases.\\nAstragalus is recommended as a tonic for the el-\\nderly. It protects cells from the aging process and\\nmay diminish other negative effects of aging. For ex-\\nample, it strengthens digestion, stimulates the ap-\\npetite, and helps improve mental functioning. Astra-\\ngalus shows promise in the treatment of Alzheimer’s\\ndisease. By itself or in combinations, it may be useful\\nin treating viral infections , hypoglycemia , diabetes\\nmellitus , chronic ulcers, insomnia ,\\nhyperthyroidism , chronic fatigue syndrome , open\\nwounds , liver problems, sexual dysfunction , fertility\\nproblems, and autoimmune diseases.\\nPreparations\\nAstragalus is available as a capsule, a tablet, a tinc-\\nture, as a part of an herbal combination, as a prepared\\ntea, and as a sweet dried root that can be eaten or made\\ninto tea. Traditionally, several slices of the root are often\\nadded to soups and stews. A strong tea can be made by\\nboiling three ounces of astragalus root in three cups of\\nwaterand letting the mixture steep for at least five min-\\nutes. Two or three cups of the unheated tea can be taken\\nover the course of a day. In tincture form, 30–60 drops of\\nastragalus can be taken four times per day. Candied roots\\ncan be purchased ready-made or prepared in the home.\\nPreparation involves combining four parts of the dried\\nroot with one part honey in water, then simmering until\\nthe herb is dried and brownish.

A\\nperson who has all three of these risk factors is eight\\ntimes more likely to develop atherosclerosis than is a\\nperson who has none. Physical inactivity, damage by ox-\\nidants, diabetes, and obesity are also risk factors for ath-\\nerosclerosis. High levels of the amino acid homocysteine\\nand abnormal levels of fats called lipoproteins also raise\\nthe risk. Other risk factors include:\\n• High triglycerides. Most fat in food and in the body\\ntakes the form of triglycerides. Blood triglyceride levels\\nabove 400 mg/dL have been linked to atherosclerosis.\\n• Physical inactivity. Lack of exercise increases the risk\\nof atherosclerosis.\\n• Diabetes mellitus. The risk of developing atherosclero-\\nsis is seriously increased for diabetics and can be low-\\nered by keeping diabetes under control. Many diabetics\\ndie from heart attacks caused by atherosclerosis.\\n• Obesity. Excess weight increases the strain on the heart\\nand increases the risk of developing atherosclerosis,\\neven if no other risk factors are present.\\n• Heredity. People whose parents have coronary artery\\ndisease, atherosclerosis, or stroke at an early age are at\\nincreased risk.\\n• Sex. Before age 60, men are more likely to have heart\\nattacks than women.\\n• Age. Risk is higher in men who are 45 years of age and\\nolder and women who are 55 years of age and older.\\nThe symptoms of atherosclerosis differ depending\\nupon the location. They may involve:\\n• In the coronary (heart) arteries: chest pain, heart at-\\ntack, and sudden death.\\n• In the carotid arteries of the brain: sudden dizziness ,\\nweakness, loss of speech, and blindness.\\n• In the femoral arteries of the legs: cramping and fa-\\ntigue in the calves of the legs when walking.\\n• In the renal arteries of the kidneys: high blood pressure\\nresistant to treatment.\\nDiagnosis\\nPhysicians may be able to make a diagnosis of ath-\\nerosclerosis during a physical exam by means of a listen-\\ning to the activity of the arteries and the heart with a\\nstethoscope and probing them with the hands. More de-\\nfinitive tests are usually called for, however. These in-\\nclude an electrocardiogram, which shows the heart’s ac-\\ntivity; exercise electrocardiography, more familiarly\\nknown as a stress test, conducted while the patient exer-\\ncises on a treadmill or a stationary bike; echocardiogra-\\nphy, a type of ultrasound using sound waves to create an\\nimage of the heart’s chambers and valves; and ultra-\\nsonography to assess arteries of the neck and thighs.\\nRadionuclide angiography and thallium scanning\\nuse radioactive material injected into the bloodstream.\\nThese tests enable physicians to see the blood flow\\nthrough the coronary arteries and the heart chambers and\\nto record pictures of the heart. Coronary angiography is\\nthe most accurate diagnostic method for artheroscerosis,\\nand it is also the only invasive procedure. A cardiologist\\ninserts a catheter equipped with a viewing device into a\\nblood vessel in the leg or arm and guides it into the heart.\\nA contrast dye makes the heart visible to x rays. Motion\\npictures are taken of the dye flowing though the arteries,\\nand plaques and blockages are well defined.\\nTreatment\\nThe most common treatments focus on dietary and\\nlifestyle changes to reduce cholesterol and other prob-\\nlems that contribute to atherosclerosis. Dietary modifica-\\ntions usually incorporate eating foods that are low in sat-\\nurated fats, cholesterol, sugar, and animal proteins. Foods\\nhigh in fiber, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, and\\nwhole grains, are encouraged. By consuming fruits and\\nvegetables, the person also consumes helpful dietary an-\\ntioxidants, such as carotenoids found in vegetable pig-\\nments, and bioflavenoids in fruit pigments. Liberal use of\\nonions and garlic is recommended, as well as eating fish,\\nespecially cold-water fish, such as salmon. Smoking, al-\\ncohol, and coffee are to be avoided; and exercise is\\nstrongly recommended. There are several well-known\\nprograms, such as those created by Nathan and Robert\\nPritikin and Dean Ornish, which are very helpful in set-\\nting up and maintaining dietary and lifestyle programs.\\nHerbal remedies for atherosclerosis include garlic\\n(Allium sativum ), ginger (Zingiber officinale ), haw-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 149\\nAtherosclerosis\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 149'),\n",

It has shown some success, but it remains\\na controversial method.\\nSeveral disciplines can offer helpful long-term\\ntreatment strategies for those with atherosclerosis. A\\nknowledgeable practitioner should be consulted.\\nAyurvedic medicinepractitioners combine diet, herbal\\nremedies, relaxation , and exercises. A homeopath will\\nprescribe a treatment regimen based on a complete as-\\nsessment. A traditional Chinese medicine practitioner\\nmay prescribe a combination of herbs such as siler\\n(Ledebouriellla divaricata ), Platycodon grandiflorum ,\\nPolygonum multiflorum, and Bupleurum chinense.\\nAcupuncture and massage may be recommended, par-\\nticularly for the accompanying circulatory problems. A\\nhomeopath will prescribe remedies based on an in-depth\\ninterview and evaluation.\\nStress is known to worsen blood pressure and ather-\\nosclerosis, and hasten the progression of the disease.\\nTherapeutic relaxation techniques are, therefore, helpful\\nadjuncts to treatment. Recommended approaches include\\nyoga, meditation , guided imagery , biofeedback , and\\ncounseling. In fact, a 2002 study showed that transcen-\\ndental meditation, when combined with diet, exercise\\nand antioxidant food supplements, contributed to nearly\\na 33% reduced long-term risk for heart attack and stroke\\nin some patients.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAllopathic treatment includes medications, balloon\\nangioplasty, and coronary artery bypass surgery. Most of\\nthe drugs prescribed for atherosclerosis seek to improve\\nconditions that contribute to the disease, such as high\\ncholesterol,blood clots, or high blood pressure.\\nAngioplasty and bypass surgery are invasive proce-\\ndures that improve blood flow in the coronary arteries.\\nCoronary angioplasty is performed by a cardiologist. It\\nis a nonsurgical procedure in which a catheter tipped\\nwith a balloon is threaded from a blood vessel in the\\nthigh into the blocked artery. When the balloon is inflat-\\ned, it compresses the plaque and enlarges the blood ves-\\nsel to open the blocked artery. In one–third of patients,\\nthe artery narrows again within six months. The proce-\\ndure may have to be repeated and a wire mesh stent may\\nbe placed in the artery to help keep it open. In bypass\\nsurgery, a detour is created with grafted or synthetic\\nblood vessels. The blood can then go around the block-\\nage. Other procedures may be used, including catheteri-\\nzation and laser treatments.\\nExpected results\\nAtherosclerosis can be successfully treated, but not\\ncured. Studies have shown that atherosclerosis can be\\ndelayed, stopped, and even reversed by aggressively low-\\nering cholesterol and changing the diet.\\nPrevention\\nA healthy lifestyle—eating right, regular exercise,\\nmaintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, and control-\\nling hypertension—can reduce the risk of developing ath-\\nerosclerosis, help keep the disease from progressing, and\\nsometimes cause it to regress. A 2002 study presented\\npromising news about the impact of simple exercise on\\nmodifying the elasticity of one’s arteries.

Odle\\nAthlete’s foot\\nDefinition\\nAthlete’s foot is a common fungus infection in\\nwhich the skin of the feet, especially on the sole and\\ntoes, becomes itchy and sore, cracking and peeling away.\\nAthlete’s foot, also known as tinea pedis, can be difficult\\nto clear up completely.\\nAthlete’s foot received its common name because\\nthe infection is often found among athletes. This is be-\\ncause the fungi flourish best in the around swimming\\npools, showers, and locker rooms.\\nDescription\\nAthlete’s foot is very common, so common that\\nmost people will have at least one episode with this fun-\\ngal infection at least once in their lives. It is found more\\noften in adult males. In fact, symptoms that appears to be\\nathlete’s foot in young children are probably caused by\\nsome other skin condition.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAthlete’s foot is caused by a fungal infection that espe-\\ncially affects the skin between the toes. The fungi that cause\\nathlete’s foot include Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagro-\\nphytes, and Epidermophyton floccosum. These fungi live\\nexclusively on dead body tissue, such as hair, the outer layer\\nof skin, and the nails. The fungus grows best in moist,\\ndamp, dark places with poor ventilation. The problem is\\nrare in children and those who customarily go barefoot.\\nMost people carry fungus on their skin. However, it\\nwill only flourish to the point of causing athlete’s foot if\\nconditions are right. The fungi multiply on the skin when it\\nis irritated, weakened, or continuously moist. Sweaty feet,\\ntight shoes, synthetic socks that do not absorb moisture\\nwell, a warm climate, and not drying the feet well after\\nswimming or bathing, all contribute to the overgrowth of\\nthe fungus. Symptoms include itchy, sore skin on the toes,\\nwith scaling, inflammation, and blisters. Blisters that\\nbreak, exposing raw patches of tissue, can cause pain and\\nswelling. The infected feet also may have an unpleasant\\nsmell. As the infection spreads,itching and burning may\\nworsen. In severe cases, the skin cracks and seeps fluid.\\nSometimes a secondary bacterial infection is also present.\\nIf it is not treated, athlete’s foot can spread to the\\nsoles of the feet and toenails. Stubborn toenail infections,\\ncalled tinea unguium, may appear at the same time, with\\ncrumbling, scaling, and thickened nails, and nail loss. The\\ninfection can spread further if patients scratch and then\\ntouch themselves elsewhere (especially in the groin or\\nunder the arms). It is also possible to spread the infection\\nto other parts of the body via contaminated bed sheets,\\ntowels, or clothing. Athlete’s foot is more severe and more\\ncommon in people taking antibiotics, corticosteroids, birth\\ncontrol pills, drugs to suppress immune function, and in\\npeople with obesity, AIDS, and diabetes mellitus.\\nDiagnosis\\nA dermatologist can diagnose the condition by\\nphysical examination and by examining a preparation of\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 151'),\n",

Not all foot rashes\\nare athlete’s foot, which is why a physician should diag-\\nnose the condition before any remedies are used. In\\norder to properly diagnose the infection, the physician\\nmay do a fungal culture. Using nonprescription products\\non a rash that is not athlete’s foot could worsen the rash,\\ntherefore, proper diagnosis is important.\\nTreatment\\nThe infected foot should be kept well ventilated. A\\nfoot bath containing cinnamon has been shown to slow\\ndown the growth of certain molds and fungi, and is said\\nto be very effective in clearing up athlete’s foot. Eight to\\nten broken cinnamon sticks are boiled in four cups of\\nwater, simmered for five minutes, and then steeped for\\n45 minutes. The mixture can be then placed in a basin\\nand used daily to soak the feet.\\nHerbal remedies used externally to treat athlete’s\\nfoot include goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), tea tree\\noil (Melaleuca spp.), myrrh (Commiphora molmol), gar-\\nlic (Allium sativa), oregano oil (though its smell is quite\\npungent), and calendula . The affected area should be\\nswabbed with an herbal mixture twice daily or the feet\\nshould be soaked in a herbal footbath. Pau d’arco, also\\ncalled taheebo or lapacho, can be used for athlete’s foot\\nas well. The tea bags can be soaked in water for about 10\\nminutes and then placed on the affected areas, or by mak-\\ning a tincture and directly rubbing the tea onto the toes.\\nAromatherapy may be helpful. Several drops of the\\nessential oilsof tea tree,peppermint(Mentha piperita), or\\nchamomile(Matricaria recutita), can be added to the bath\\nwater. Chamomile may be applied directly to the toes.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nSimple cases of athlete’s foot usually respond to an-\\ntifungal creams or sprays, such as tolnaftate (Aftate or\\nTinactin), clotrimazole, miconazole nitrate (Micatin\\nproducts), or Whitfield’s tincture made of salicylic acid\\nand benzoic acid. Athlete’s foot may be resistant to topi-\\ncal medication and should not be ignored. If the infec-\\ntion is resistant, the doctor may prescribe an oral antifun-\\ngal drug such as ketoconozole or griseofulvin. Untreated\\nathlete’s foot may lead to a secondary bacterial infection\\nin the skin cracks.\\nExpected results\\nAthlete’s foot usually responds well to treatment, but\\nit is important to complete the recommmended treatment,\\neven if the skin appears to be free of fungus; otherwise,\\nthe infection could return. Tinea unguium may accompany\\nathlete’s foot. It is typically very hard to treat effectively.\\nPrevention\\nA healthy diet should be maintained. Foods with a\\nhigh sugar content should be avoided, including undilut-\\ned fruit juice, honey, and maple syrup.\\nGood personal hygiene and a few simple precau-\\ntions can help prevent athlete’s foot. These include:\\n• The feet should be washed daily; care should be taken\\nto avoid contact with other parts of the body.\\n• The feet should be kept dry, especially between toes.\\n• Tight shoes and shoes made of synthetic material\\nshould not be worn.\\n• The feet need to be kept well ventilated, especially in\\nthe summer; bare feet and sandals are recommended.\\n• Absorbent polypropylene or white cotton socks are rec-\\nommended; they should be and changed often.\\n• Bathing shoes should be worn in public bathing or\\nshowering areas.\\n• A good quality foot powder should be used to keep the\\nfeet dry.\\n• If anyone in the family has athlete’s foot, towels,\\nfloors, and shower stalls should be washed with hot\\nwater and disinfectant after use.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nDonahue, Peggy Jo.

It emphasizes meat, cheese, and\\neggs, while discouraging foods such as bread, pasta,\\nfruit, and sugar. It is a form of ketogenic diet.\\nOrigins\\nRobert C. Atkins, a cardiologist and internist, devel-\\noped the diet in the early 1970s. It first came to public at-\\ntention in 1972 with the publication of Dr. Atkins’ Diet\\nRevolution . It quickly became a bestseller but unlike\\nmost other fad diets, has remained popular. At last count,\\nit had sold more than 15 million copies worldwide. Since\\nthen, Atkins authored a number of other books on his\\ndiet theme before his accidental death in 2003.\\nBenefits\\nThe primary benefit of the diet is rapid and substan-\\ntial weight loss. By restricting carbohydrate intake, the\\nbody will burn more fat stored in the body. Since there\\nare no limits on the amount of calories or quantities of\\nfoods allowed on the diet, there is little hunger between\\nmeals. According to Atkins, the diet can alleviate symp-\\ntoms of conditions such as fatigue , irritability,\\nheadaches, depression , and some types of joint and\\nmuscle pain.\\nDescription\\nThe regimen is a low-carbohydrate, or ketogenic\\ndiet, characterized by initial rapid weight loss, usually\\ndue to water loss. Drastically reducing the amount of\\ncarbohydrate intake causes liver and muscle glycogen\\nloss, which has a strong but temporary diuretic effect.\\nLong-term weight loss is said to occur because with a\\nlow amount of carbohydrate intake, the body burns\\nstored fat for energy.\\nThe four-step diet starts with a two-week induction\\nprogram designed to rebalance an individual’s metabo-\\nlism. Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowed\\nbut carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams per\\nday. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry,\\nfish, eggs, cheese, and cream. The daily amount of car-\\nbohydrates allowed equals about three cups of salad veg-\\netables, such as lettuce, cucumbers, and celery.\\nThe second stage is for ongoing weight loss. It allows\\n15-40 grams of carbohydrates a day. When the individual\\nis about 10 pounds from their desired weight, they begin\\nthe pre-maintenance phase. This gradually adds one to\\nthree servings a week of high carbohydrate foods, such as\\na piece of fruit or slice of whole-wheat bread. When the\\ndesired weight is reached, the maintenance stage begins. It\\nallows 40-60 grams of carbohydrates per day.\\nPreparations\\nNo advance preparation is needed to go on the diet.\\nHowever, as with most diets, it is generally considered ap-\\npropriate to consult with a physician and to have a physi-\\ncal evaluation before starting such a nutritional regimen.\\nThe evaluation should include blood tests to determine\\nlevels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, and\\nuric acid. A glucose tolerance test also is recommended.\\nPrecautions\\nAdherence to the Atkins diet can result in vitamin\\nand mineral deficiencies. In his books, Atkins recom-\\nmends a wide range of nutritional supplements, includ-\\ning a multi-vitamin. Among his recommendations,\\nAtkins suggests the following daily dosages: 300-600\\nmicrograms (mcg) of chromium picolinate, 100-400\\nmilligrams (mg) of pantetheine, 200 mcg of selenium ,\\nand 450-675 mcg of biotin.\\nThe diet is not recommended for lacto-ovo vegetari-\\nans, since it cannot be done as successfully without pro-\\ntein derived from animal products. Also, vegans cannot\\nfollow this diet, since a vegan diet is too high in carbohy-\\ndrates, according to Atkins. Instead, he recommends\\nvegetarians with a serious weight problem give up vege-\\ntarianism, or at least include fish in their diet. In 2003, a\\nphysicians group warned that high-protein diets may\\ncause permanent kidney loss in anyone with reduced\\nkidney function. They also can increase people’s risk of\\ncolon cancer and osteoporosis.\\nSide effects\\nAccording to Atkins, the diet causes no adverse side\\neffects. Many health care professionals disagree. In a\\nfact sheet for the Healthcare Reality Check Web site\\n(http://www.hcrc.org), Ellen Coleman, a registered dieti-\\ncian and author, said the diet may have serious side ef-\\nfects for some people. She said complications associated\\nwith the diet include ketosis, dehydration, electrolyte\\nloss,calcium depletion, weakness, nausea, and kidney\\nproblems. “It is certainly riskier for overweight individu-\\nals with medical problems such as heart disease, hyper-\\ntension, kidney disease, and diabetes than it is for over-\\nweight people with no health problems,” she said.\\nPeople with diabetes taking insulin are at risk of be-\\ncoming hypoglycemic if they do not eat appropriate car-\\nbohydrates.

It\\ngrows in mountain valleys, especially in China’s Zhe-\\njiang province. It may also be cultivated. In autumn, it\\npresents magenta corolla blooms.\\nIn Mandarin, atractylodes is called Bai Zhu, Bai Shu,\\nYu Zhu, and Dong Zhu. The Cantonese term is Paak Sat,\\nand the Japanese call it Byakujutsu. Common names in-\\nclude large-headed atractylodes, white atractylodes, and\\nwhite shu. Its pharmaceutical name, used to distinguish it\\nas a medicine, is Rhizoma Atractylodis, and it is one of\\nmore than 500 plants recognized as official drugs in tradi-\\ntional Chinese medicine. Related species, A. lancea and\\nA. chinensis , both called black or gray atractylodes, are\\nalso used medicinally for similar but distinct purposes.\\nGeneral use\\nPractitioners of Chinese medicine believe that\\natractylodes affects the Spleen and Stomach meridians,\\nor energy pathways in the body. Its medicinal properties\\nare considered warm, mildly bitter, and sweet.\\nAtractylodes is thought to dry dampness, strengthen\\nthe Spleen or digestion, and promote diuresis, the forma-\\ntion and excretion of urine. It is used for diarrhea,g e n -\\neralized aching, mental fatigue , dizziness , lack of ap-\\npetite, vomiting , edema (accumulation of fluids), and\\nspontaneous sweating. It is also used to prevent miscar-\\nriage and to treat restless fetal movement. Other uses in-\\nclude restoring deficient digestion associated with poor\\nabsorption, malnutrition, anorexia, metabolic acidosis,\\nhypogylcemia, and rheumatism. It has also been used to\\ntreat tumors of the cervix, uterus, breast, and stomach.\\nAccording to traditional Chinese medicine, both white\\nand black atractylodes may be used for digestive and urinary\\nproblems.

It also affects about 4% of adults. The\\ndisorder affects boys more often than girls. Although dif-\\nficult to assess in infancy and toddlerhood, signs of\\nADHD may begin to appear as early as age two or three,\\nbut the symptom picture changes as adolescence ap-\\nproaches. Many symptoms, particularly hyperactivity,\\ndiminish in early adulthood. However, impulsivity and\\ninattention problems remain with up to 50% of ADHD\\nindividuals throughout their adult life.\\nChildren with ADHD have short attention spans and\\nare easily bored and/or frustrated with tasks. Although\\nthey may be quite intelligent, their lack of focus fre-\\nquently results in poor grades and difficulties in school.\\nADHD children act impulsively, taking action first and\\nthinking later. They are constantly moving, running,\\nclimbing, squirming, and fidgeting, but often have trou-\\nble with gross and fine motor skills. As a result, they\\nmay be physically clumsy and awkward. Their clumsi-\\nness may extend to the social arena, where they are\\nsometimes shunned due to their impulsive and intrusive\\nbehavior. Some critics argue that ADHD is a condition\\ncreated and diagnosed in the Western world, particular to\\nthe environment of highly developed countries, since it is\\nnot diagnosed in other cultures. These critics of the\\nADHD diagnosis feel that medicating a child does not\\naddress the true underlying problem. They also note that\\nthere may not be a problem at all because children are\\nnaturally active and impulsive.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe causes of ADHD are not known. However, it ap-\\npears that heredity plays a major role in the development\\nof ADHD. Children with an ADHD parent or sibling are\\nmore likely to develop the disorder. Before birth, ADHD\\nchildren may have been exposed to poor maternal nutri-\\ntion, viral infections , or maternal substance abuse. In\\nearly childhood, exposure to lead or other toxins can\\ncause ADHD-like symptoms. Traumatic brain injury or\\nneurological disorders also may trigger ADHD symp-\\ntoms. Although the exact cause of ADHD is not known,\\nan imbalance of certain neurotransmitters (the chemicals\\nin the brain that send messages between nerve cells) is\\nbelieved to be the mechanism behind ADHD symptoms.\\nA widely publicized study conducted by Ben Fein-\\ngold in the early 1970s suggested that allergies to certain\\nfoods and food additives caused the characteristic hyper-\\nactivity of ADHD children. Although some children may\\nhave adverse reactions to certain foods that can affect\\ntheir behavior (for example, a rash might temporarily\\ncause a child to be distracted from other tasks), carefully\\ncontrolled follow-up studies have uncovered no link be-\\ntween food allergies and ADHD. Another popularly held\\nmisconception about food and ADHD is that eating\\nsugar causes hyperactive behavior. Again, studies have\\nshown no link between sugar intake and ADHD. It is im-\\nportant to note, however, that a nutritionally balanced\\ndiet is important for normal development in all children.\\nPeople with ADHD suffer from a variety of symp-\\ntoms. These symptoms include such things as distrac-\\ntion, not paying attention, inconsistency, forgetfulness of\\neven simple tasks, fidgeting, verbal impulsivity, and so\\non. It is interesting to note that everyone suffers from\\nthese symptoms at times, but an individual with ADHD\\nwill have more of these symptoms more of the time.\\nSome doctors indicated immature symmetric tonic\\nneck reflex (STNR) as a possible cause of certain symp-\\ntoms. Other studies in 1993 and 1994 showed a link be-\\ntween the disorder and diet, dyes, and preservatives. In\\nanother study in 1996, ADHD was linked to maternal\\nsmokingduring pregnancy.\\nPsychologists and other mental health professionals\\ntypically use the criteria listed in the Diagnostic and Sta-\\ntistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition\\n(DSM-IV)as a guideline for determining the presence of\\nADHD. For a diagnosis of ADHD, DSM-IV requires the\\npresence of at least six of the following symptoms of\\ninattention, or six or more symptoms of hyperactivity\\nand impulsivity combined.\\nInattention\\n• fails to pay close attention to detail or makes careless\\nmistakes in schoolwork or other activities\\n• has difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or activities\\n• does not appear to listen when spoken to\\n• does not follow through on instructions and does not\\nfinish tasks\\n• has difficulty organizing tasks and activities\\n• avoids or dislikes tasks that require sustained mental\\neffort (like homework)\\n• is easily distracted\\n• is forgetful in daily activities\\nHyperactivity\\n• fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat\\n• does not remain seated when expected to\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 157\\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 157'),\n",

Children who meet the symptom crite-\\nria for inattention, but not for hyperactivity/impulsivity are\\ndiagnosed with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder,\\npredominantly inattentive type, commonly called ADD.\\n(Young girls with ADHD may not be diagnosed because\\nthey have mainly this subtype of the disorder.)\\nDiagnosis\\nThe first step in determining if a child has ADHD is\\nto consult with a pediatrician, a doctor who treats chil-\\ndren. The pediatrician can make an initial evaluation of\\nthe child’s developmental maturity compared to other\\nchildren in his or her age group. The doctor also should\\nperform a comprehensive physical examination to rule\\nout any organic causes of ADHD symptoms, such as an\\noveractive thyroid or vision or hearing problems.\\nIf no organic problem can be found, a psychologist, psy-\\nchiatrist, neurologist, neuropsychologist, or learning specialist\\ntypically is consulted to perform a comprehensive ADHD as-\\nsessment. A complete medical, family, social, psychiatric, and\\neducational history is compiled from existing medical and\\nschool records and from interviews with parents and teachers.\\nInterviews also may be conducted with the child, depending\\non his or her age. Along with these interviews, several clinical\\ninventories also may be used, such as the Conners Rating\\nScales (Teacher’s Questionnaire and Parent’s Questionnaire),\\nChild Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and the Achenbach Child\\nBehavior Rating Scales. These inventories provide valuable\\ninformation on the child’s behavior in different settings and\\nsituations. In addition, the Wender Utah Rating Scale has been\\nadapted for use in diagnosing ADHD in adults.\\nIt is important to note that mental disorders such as\\ndepression and anxiety disorder can cause symptoms\\nsimilar to ADHD. A complete and comprehensive psychi-\\natric assessment is critical to differentiate ADHD from\\nother possible mood and behavioral disorders. Bipolar\\ndisorder, for example, may be misdiagnosed as ADHD.\\nPublic schools are required by federal law to offer\\nfree ADHD testing upon request. A pediatrician also can\\nprovide a referral to a psychologist or pediatric specialist\\nfor ADHD assessment. Parents should check with their\\ninsurance plans to see if these services are covered.\\nTreatment\\nA 2003 survey showed that approximately 54% of\\nparents reported using complementary or alternative\\nmedicine treatments for their children in the previous\\nyear. Some parents reported turning to these therapies\\nbecause doctors don’t always agree on the ADHD diag-\\nnosis and cannot adequately explain how allopathic drug\\ntreatments calm people and improve mental focus. Be-\\nhavior modification therapy uses a reward system to re-\\ninforce good behavior as well as task completion and can\\nbe used both in the classroom and at home. A tangible\\nreward such as a sticker may be given to the child every\\ntime he completes a task or behaves in an acceptable\\nmanner. A chart system may be used to display the stick-\\ners and visually illustrate the child’s progress. When a\\ncertain number of stickers are collected, the child may\\ntrade them in for a bigger reward such as a trip to the zoo\\nor a day at the beach. The reward system stays in place\\nuntil the good behavior becomes ingrained.\\nA variation of this technique, cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy, works to decrease impulsive behavior by getting\\nthe child to recognize the connection between thoughts\\nand behavior, and to change behavior by changing nega-\\ntive thinking patterns.\\nIndividual psychotherapy can help ADHD children\\nbuild self-esteem, give them a place to discuss their worries\\nand anxieties, and help them gain insight into their behavior\\nand feelings. Family therapy also may be beneficial in help-\\ning family members develop coping skills and work\\nthrough feelings of guilt or anger they may be experiencing.\\nADHD children perform better within a familiar,\\nconsistent, and structured routine with positive reinforce-\\nments for good behavior and real consequences for bad.\\nFamily, friends, and caretakers should be educated on\\nthe special needs and behaviors of the ADHD child.\\nCommunication between parents and teachers is espe-\\ncially critical to ensuring an ADHD child has an appro-\\npriate learning environment.\\nA number of alternative treatments exist for ADHD.\\nAlthough there is a lack of controlled studies to prove\\ntheir efficacy, proponents report that they are successful\\nin controlling symptoms in some ADHD patients.

Based in part on the Feingold food al-\\nlergy diet, dietary therapy focuses on a nutritional plan\\nthat is high in protein and complex carbohydrates and\\nfree of white sugar and salicylate-containing foods\\nsuch as strawberries, tomatoes, and grapes.\\n• Herbal therapy. Herbal therapy uses a variety of natural\\nremedies to address the symptoms of ADHD. Ginkgo\\n(Gingko biloba) is used for memory and mental sharp-\\nness and chamomile (Matricaria recutita ) extract is\\nused for calming. The safety of herbal remedies has not\\nbeen demonstrated in controlled studies. For example,\\nit is known that gingko may affect blood coagulation,\\nbut controlled studies have not yet evaluated the risk of\\nthe effect.\\n• Vitamin and mineral supplements. Some vitamin and\\nmineral supplements that are thought to be effective by\\nsome alternative practitioners include calcium , zinc,\\nmagnesium, iron, inositol, trace minerals, blue-green\\nalgae. Also recommended are the combined amino\\nacids GABA, glycine, taurine, L-glutamine, L-pheny-\\nlalanine, and L-tyrosine. In 2003, a study reported that\\na combination of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids\\nsupplements may help with cognitive and behavioral\\nsymptoms of ADHD.\\n• Homeopathic medicine. This is probably the most effec-\\ntive alternative therapy for ADD and ADHD because it\\ntreats the whole person at a core level. Constitutional\\nhomeopathic care is most appropriate and requires con-\\nsulting with a well-trained homeopath who has experi-\\nence working with ADD and ADHD individuals.\\n• Auricular acupuncture. A small study in 1997 indicat-\\ned that this type of acupuncture therapy might be effec-\\ntive in some children.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nPsychosocial therapy, usually combined with medica-\\ntions, is the treatment approach of choice to alleviate\\nADHD symptoms. Psychostimulants, such as dextroam-\\nphetamine (Dexedrine), pemoline (Cylert), and\\nmethylphenidate (Ritalin) commonly are prescribed to\\ncontrol hyperactive and impulsive behavior and increase\\nattention span. They work by stimulating the production of\\ncertain neurotransmitters in the brain. Possible side effects\\nof stimulants include nervous tics, irregular heartbeat, loss\\nof appetite, and insomnia. However, the medications usu-\\nally are well-tolerated and safe in most cases. But accord-\\ning to Carolyn Chambers Clark, R.N., Ed.D., 25% of the\\nchildren with ADHD do not respond to stimulant drugs.\\nIn children who don’t respond well to stimulant\\ntherapy, tricyclic antidepressants such as desipramine\\n(Norpramin, Pertofane) and amitriptyline (Elavil) are\\nfrequently recommended. Reported side effects of these\\ndrugs include persistent dry mouth, sedation, disorien-\\ntation, and irregular heartbeat (particularly with de-\\nsipramine). Other medications prescribed for ADHD\\ntherapy include buproprion (Wellbutrin), an antidepres-\\nsant; fluoxetine (Prozac), an antidepressant; and carba-\\nmazepine (Tegretol, Atretol), an anticonvulsant drug.\\nClonidine (Catapres), a medication for high blood pres-\\nsure, also has been used to control aggression and hyper-\\nactivity in some ADHD children, although it should not\\nbe used with Ritalin. A child’s response to medication\\nwill change with age and maturation, so ADHD symp-\\ntoms should be monitored closely and prescriptions ad-\\njusted accordingly.\\nIn mid-2003, the first new drug for treating ADHD\\nwas about to become available. Called atomoxetine\\n(Strattera), it was planned to offer several advantages\\nover standard stimulants. First, atomoxetine is not a con-\\ntrolled substance, so physicians can write prescriptions\\nfor a larger number of pills and refills. Further, it doesn’t\\nhave the potential for abuse that the stimulant drugs pose.\\nExpected results\\nUntreated, ADHD negatively affects a child’s social\\nand educational performance and can seriously damage\\nhis or her sense of self-esteem. ADHD children have im-\\npaired relationships with their peers and may be looked\\nupon as social outcasts. They may be seen as slow learn-\\ners or troublemakers in the classroom. Siblings and even\\nparents may develop resentful feelings toward the\\nADHD child.\\nSome ADHD children also develop a conduct disor-\\nder problem. For those adolescents who have both ADHD\\nand a conduct disorder, up to 25% go on to develop anti-\\nsocial personality disorder and the criminal behavior,\\nsubstance abuse, and high rate of suicide attempts that are\\nsymptomatic of it. Children diagnosed with ADHD also\\nare more likely to have a learning disorder, a mood disor-\\nder such as depression, or an anxiety disorder.\\nApproximately 70-80% of ADHD patients treated\\nwith stimulant medication experience significant relief\\nfrom symptoms, at least in the short-term. Approximate-\\nly half of ADHD children seem to “outgrow” the disor-\\nder in adolescence or early adulthood. The other half\\nwill retain some or all symptoms of ADHD as adults.\\nWith early identification and intervention, careful com-\\npliance with a treatment program, and a supportive and\\nnurturing home and school environment, ADHD children\\ncan flourish socially and academically.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 159\\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 159'),\n",

Aucklandia has been\\nused for centuries in Chinese and Indian herbal healing.\\nMore recently it has been used in Western aromatherapy.\\nAucklandia comes from a perennial plant that grows\\nto about 6 ft (2 m) in height. It is native to northern India\\nand Pakistan. This plant is also cultivated in other parts\\nof India and in southwest China. The long, tapering root\\nis harvested and dried for healing.\\nIn some regions of Asia, several other species of\\nplant are used interchangeably with Saussurea costus .\\nThese include Saussurea lappa and Saussurea\\nvladimirus. Locally, aucklandia is also called kuth, kust,\\nkushta, qust-e-shereen, and patchak.\\nGeneral use\\nAucklandia is used in China and India to treat three\\nmain categories of complaints that center around the diges-\\ntive system, the lungs, and infections. Aucklandia is used to\\ntreat symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, colon\\nspasms, poor digestion, abdominal gas, and stomach pain.\\nIn laboratory studies, aucklandia has been shown to be an\\nantispasmodic, accounting for its effectiveness against such\\nsymptoms as nausea and diarrhea. It is also sometimes used\\nto treat gallstones and jaundice, although no scientific\\nstudies have confirmed its effectiveness for these uses.\\nAucklandia is used in many places in Asia to treat\\nasthma, bronchitis, and uncontrolled cough. The anti-\\nspasmodic component of the root extract causes the air-\\nways to relax and open more widely so that breathing\\nbecomes easier. This same property causes it to mildly\\nlower blood pressure by relaxing the artery walls. How-\\never, it does not lower blood pressure as effectively as\\nsome other herbs.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2160\\nAucklandia\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nConduct disorder —A behavioral and emotional\\ndisorder of childhood and adolescence.

Some research sug-\\ngests that aucklandia may be effective against infections\\nsuch as cholera and typhoid.\\nA 1991 study published in the Journal of the Pak-\\nistani Medical Association found that oral doses of an\\nextract of the root of Saussurea lappa significantly re-\\nduced nematode infestation in children. Nematodes are\\nparasitic roundworms. Another 1998 study done in\\nKorea found that an extract of Saussurea lappa killed\\ntiny brine shrimp. One compound isolated in the brine\\nshrimp investigation is known to be moderately effective\\nin killing some types of human tumor cell types in labo-\\nratory settings. It appears that the use of aucklandia as an\\nantiseptic has some basis in scientific fact.\\nOther uses of aucklandia that have not been investi-\\ngated in regulated scientific studies include using it as a\\ntreatment for water retention and lung tumors. In addi-\\ntion to its medicinal uses, aucklandia is a fragrance and\\nfixative in perfumes, shampoo, and hair dye. It is used in\\nthe Asian food industry to flavor alcoholic beverages,\\nsoft drinks, and sweets.\\nPreparations\\nAucklandia can be prepared as either a distilled ex-\\ntract or as an essential oil. The dried roots are chopped\\nfine and softened in warm water, then distilled with\\nsteam. The resulting water-based distillate is then sub-\\njected to a solvent extraction to remove the active ingre-\\ndients. The resulting yellow-brown fluid has a long-last-\\ning woody or musty odor.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 178}, page_content='Auditory integration training\\nDefinition\\nAuditory integration training (AIT), is one specific\\ntype of music/auditory therapy based upon the work of\\nFrench otolaryngologists Dr. Alfred Tomatis and Dr. Guy\\nBerard.\\nOrigins\\nThe premise upon which most auditory integration\\nprograms are based is that distortion in how things are\\nheard contributes to commonly seen behavioral or learn-\\ning disorders in children. Some of these disorders in-\\nclude attention deficit/hyperactive disorder (ADHD),\\nautism, dyslexia, and central auditory processing disor-\\nders (CAPD). Training the patient to listen can stimulate\\ncentral and cortical organization.\\nAuditory integration is one facet of what audiolo-\\ngists call central auditory processing. The simplest defin-\\nition of central auditory processing, or CAP, is Universi-\\nty of Buffalo Professor of Audiology Jack Katz’s, which\\nis: “What we do with what we hear.” Central auditory in-\\ntegration is actually the perception of sound, including\\nthe ability to attend to sound, to remember it, retaining it\\nin both the long- and short-term memory, to be able to\\nlisten to sound selectively, and to localize it.\\nGuy Berard developed one of the programs com-\\nmonly used. Berard’s auditory integration training con-\\nsists of twenty half-hour sessions spent listening to musi-\\ncal sounds via a stereophonic system. The music is ran-\\ndom, with filtered frequencies, and the person listens\\nthrough earphones. These sound waves vibrate and exer-\\ncise structures in the middle ear. This is normally done in\\nsessions twice a day for 10 days.\\nAlfred Tomatis is also the inventor of the Electronic\\nEar. This device operates through a series of filters, and\\nreestablishes the dominance of the right ear in hearing. The\\nbasis of Tomatis’ work is a series of principles that follow:\\n• The most important purpose of the ear is to adapt sound\\nwaves into signals that charge the brain.\\n• Sound is conducted via both air and bone. It can be\\nconsidered something that nourishes the nervous sys-\\ntem, either stimulating or destimulating it.\\n• Just as seeing is not the same as looking, hearing is not\\nthe same as listening. Hearing is passive. Listening is\\nactive.\\n• A person’s ability to listen affects all language develop-\\nment for that person. This process influences every as-\\npect of self-image and social development.\\n• The capacity to listen can be changed or improved\\nthrough auditory stimulation using musical and vocal\\nsounds at high frequencies.\\n• Communication begins in the womb. As early as the\\nbeginning of the second trimester, fetuses can hear\\nsounds. These sounds literally cause the brain and ner-\\nvous system of the baby to develop.\\nDescription\\nA quartet of CAP defects have been identified that\\ncan unfavorably alter how each person processes sound.\\nAmong these are:\\n• Phonetic decoding, a problem that occurs when the\\nbrain incorrectly decodes what is being heard. Sounds\\nare unrecognizable, often because the person speaking\\ntalks too fast.\\n• Tolerance-fading memory, a condition with little or\\npoor tolerance for background sounds.\\n• Auditory integration involves a person’s ability to put\\ntogether things heard with things seen. Characteristi-\\ncally there are long response delays and trouble with\\nphonics, or recognizing the symbols for sounds.\\n• The fourth problem area, often called auditory organi-\\nzation, overlaps the previous three. It is characterized\\nby disorganization in handling auditory and other infor-\\nmation.\\nCertain audiological tests are carried out to see if the\\nperson has a CAP problem, and if so, how severe it is.\\nOther tests give more specific information regarding the\\nnature of the CAP problem. They include:\\n• Puretone air-conduction threshold testing, which mea-\\nsures peripheral hearing loss . If loss is found, then\\nbone-conduction testing, or evaluation of the vibration\\nof small bones in the inner ear, is also carried out.\\n• Word discrimination scores (WDS) determines a per-\\nson’s clarity in hearing ideal speech. This is done by\\npresenting 25–50 words at 40 decibels above the per-\\nson’s average sound threshold in each ear. Test scores\\nequal the percentage of words heard correctly.\\n• Immittance testing is made up of two parts, assessing\\nthe status of, and the protective mechanisms of the\\nmiddle ear.\\n• Staggered sporadic word (SSW) testing delivers 40\\ncompound words in an overlapping way at 50 decibels\\nabove threshold to each ear of the person being tested.\\nThis test provides expanded information that makes it\\npossible to break down CAP problems into the four\\nbasic types.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2162\\nAuditory integration training\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 162'),\n",

The types of errors made in sounding out\\nwritten words or associating written letters with the\\nsounds they represent help in determining the type and\\nseverity of CAP problems.\\nBenefits\\nUpon completion of an auditory integration training\\nprogram, the person’s hearing should be capable of per-\\nceiving all frequencies at, or near, the same level. Total\\nimprovement from this therapy, in both hearing and be-\\nhavior, can take up to one year.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nAuditory integration training is based upon newly\\nlearned information about the brain. Though brain structures\\nand connections are predetermined, probably by heredity,\\nanother factor called plasticityalso comes into play. Learn-\\ning, we now know, continues from birth to death. Plasticity\\nis the ability of the brain to actually change its structuring\\nand connections through the process of learning.\\nProblems with auditory processing are now viewed\\nas having a wide-reaching ripple effect on our society. It\\nis estimated that 30–40% of children starting school\\nhave language-learning skills that can be described as\\npoor. CAP difficulties are a factor in several different\\nlearning disabilities. They affect not only academic suc-\\ncess, but also nearly every aspect of societal difficulties.\\nOne example to illustrate this is a 1989 University of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 163\\nAuditory integration training\\nInternationally renowned French otolaryngologist,\\npsychologist, educator and inventor Alfred Tomatis early-\\non perceived the importance of sound and hearing. He\\ntook his degree as a Doctor of Medicine from the Univer-\\nsity of Paris and specialized in ear, nose and throat medi-\\ncine. The son of two opera singers, Tomatis early in his\\ncareer treated some of his parents’ fellow opera singers.\\nFrom these experiences with the sound of music, he de-\\nveloped the principle that has come to be known as the\\nTomatis Effect, i.e. that the human voice can only sing\\nwhat it hears.\\nTomatis has been called the Einstein of the ear. It\\nwas his research that made the world aware that the ears\\nof an infant in utero are already functioning at four and\\nhalf months of age. Just as the umbilical cord provides\\nnourishment to the unborn infant’s body, Tomatis postu-\\nlated that the sound of the mother’s voice is also a nutri-\\nent heard by the fetus. This sound literally charges and\\nstimulates the growth of the brain.\\nDr. Tomatis took this further, into the realm of lan-\\nguage. Tomatis concluded that the need to communicate\\nand to be understood are among our most basic needs.\\nHe was a pioneer in perceiving that language problems\\nconvert into social problems for people. “Language is\\nwhat characterizes man and makes him different from\\nother creatures,” Tomatis is quoted as saying. The tech-\\nniques he developed to teach people how to listen effec-\\ntively are internationally respected tools used in the treat-\\nment of autism, attention-deficit disorder, and other\\nlearning disabilities.\\nHis listening program, the invention of the Electronic\\nEar, and his work with the therapeutic use of sound and\\nmusic for the past fifty years have made Tomatis arguably\\nthe best known and most successful ear specialist in the\\nworld. There are more than two hundred Tomatis Centers\\nworldwide, treating a vast variety of problems related to\\nthe ability to hear.\\nJoan Schonbeck\\nALFRED TOMATIS 1920–2001\\n(Photograph by V.

Aura\\ntherapy is generally considered a subtype of biofield\\ntherapy, which is a form of energy therapy that utilizes\\nenergies thought to reside in or emanate from the human\\nbody (as distinct from electromagnetic energy therapies).\\nThere are several variations of treatment, but in general\\naura therapy emphasizes manipulating the aura energy\\nback into a positive balance.\\nOrigins\\nThe exact origin of aura therapy is unknown, but\\nhistorical references to it date back about 5,000 years.\\nEast Indian, Chinese, Jewish, and Christian faiths all\\nhave references to auras as energies that vibrate through\\nphysical matter. The energies are seen as colors and rep-\\nresent such states of being emotional, mental, astral, and\\ncelestial. Halos have also been considered a kind of aura.\\nHistorically, it was believed that the special powers of a\\npsychic, mystic, or clairvoyant were needed to see auras.\\nToday, there are many New Age centers that teach the art\\nof aura reading and therapy.\\nIn the late 1890s, the scientist and inventor Nicola\\nTesla (1856–1943) became the first person to photograph\\nan aura. Auric photography took a big leap forward in\\nthe late 1930s when Semyon and Valentina Kirlian intro-\\nduced a high-voltage imaging process that became\\nknown as Kirlian photography . Although there have\\nbeen challenges to the use of Kirlian photography, the\\nprocess was designed to photograph aura energy emitted\\nby life forms, including plants, animals, and humans. A\\nnewer variation is aura imaging photography, which uses\\na special camera to take instant photos of a person’s\\naura. The size, shape, and color of the aura can then be\\nanalyzed to reveal specific physical, emotional, and\\nmental problems.\\nTypes of aura therapy\\nSince the early 1970s, several different forms of\\naura therapy have emerged within the alternative medi-\\ncine field. Some brief descriptions follow.\\nAura color therapy\\nAura color therapy is more closely related to light\\ntherapy than to such other forms of aura therapy as ther-\\napeutic touch . In aura color therapy, the proportions of\\nthe colors in a person’s aura as well as their clarity or in-\\ntensity are analyzed and treated. Aura color therapists\\nmaintain that the aura of a healthy person will have an\\nundistorted oval shape around the body, with clear lines\\nof light energy and a perfect balance of the seven colors\\nof the rainbow. Muddy colors, bulges or swirls in the en-\\nergy lines, or an absence of any of the major colors signal\\nenergy imbalances. For example, a depressed person will\\nhave large amounts of blue and green in the aura with no\\norange or yellow. A chronically angry person will have\\ntoo much red and little or no blue.\\nColor therapy treatment consists of adding extra col-\\nors to a dull or depleted aura or using complementary\\ncolors to correct a color imbalance in the aura. For exam-\\nple, orange, which is the complementary color of blue,\\nwould be used to treat the aura of a depressed person.\\nSeveral different techniques may be used to add or bal-\\nance the colors, the most common being the use of col-\\nored lights to irradiate the client’s body, or the placement\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2164\\nAura therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 164'),\n",

In another varia-\\ntion of aura color therapy, the client is advised to wear\\nclothing in colors intended to balance or correct the aura.\\nTherapeutic touch (TT)\\nTherapeutic touch, or TT, is a form of energy thera-\\npy that was developed in the United States in 1972 by\\nDora Kunz, a psychic healer, and Dolores Krieger, a pro-\\nfessor of nursing at New York University. In TT, the\\npractitioner alters the patient’s energy field through a\\ntransfer of energy from his or her hands to the patient.\\nWhen illness occurs, it creates a disturbance or blockage\\nin the aura or vital energy field. The TT practitioner uses\\nher/his hands to discern the blockage or disturbance. Al-\\nthough the technique is called “therapeutic touch,” there\\nis generally no touching of the client’s physical body,\\nonly his or her energetic body or biofield. TT is usually\\nperformed on fully clothed patients who are either lying\\ndown on a flat surface or sitting up in a chair.\\nA therapeutic touch session consists of five steps or\\nphases. The first step is a period of meditation on the\\npractitioner’s part, to become spiritually centered and en-\\nergized for the task of healing. The second step is assess-\\nment or discernment of the energy imbalances in the pa-\\ntient’s aura. In this step, the TT practitioner holds his or\\nher hands about 2–3 inches above the patient’s body and\\nmoves them in long, sweeping strokes from the patient’s\\nhead downward to the feet. The practitioner may feel a\\nsense of warmth, heaviness, tingling, or similar cues, as\\nthey are known in TT. The cues are thought to reveal the\\nlocation of the energy disturbances or imbalances. In the\\nthird step, known as the unruffling process, the practi-\\ntioner removes the energy disturbances with downward\\nsweeping movements. In the fourth step, the practitioner\\nserves as a channel for the transfer of universal energy to\\nthe patient. The fifth step consists of smoothing the pa-\\ntient’s energy field and restoring a symmetrical pattern\\nof energy flow. After the treatment, the patient rests for\\n10–15 minutes.\\nTellington touch (Ttouch)\\nTellington touch, which is also known as Ttouch, is an\\ninteresting instance of an alternative therapy that began in\\nveterinary practice and was later extended to humans.\\nTtouch was developed in England by Linda Tellington-\\nJones, a graduate of Feldenkraistraining. The Feldenkrais\\nmethod, which is usually considered a bodywork therapy,\\noriginated with Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais (1904–1984), a\\nscientist and engineer who was also a judo instructor. The\\nFeldenkrais method is based on redirecting the client’s ha-\\nbitual patterns of body movement, but it is unusual among\\nbodywork therapies in its emphasis on new patterns of\\nthinking and imagination as byproducts of the body’s reed-\\nucation. Tellington-Jones, who was employed as a horse\\ntrainer, began using Feldenkrais techniques on horses in\\n1975. In 1983 she developed the pattern of circular touch-\\ning motions known as Tellington touch.\\nIn the 1980s, Ttouch expanded from treating behav-\\nioral problems in horses to treating cats, dogs, and other\\nhousehold pets. In the 1990s, Ttouch was introduced into\\nnursing school curricula for the treatment of humans. It\\nhas been used to treat patients suffering from such\\nchronic conditions as pain syndromes, Alzheimer’s dis-\\nease, arthritis, and multiple sclerosis as well as patients\\nrecovering from traumatic injuries or stroke. Ttouch is\\ngrowing in popularity among hospice nurses as an alter-\\nnative treatment for patients facing death.\\nIn Ttouch, the practitioner touches the client’s skin\\nbut does not manipulate the underlying muscles or\\nbones. The practitioner imagines the face of a clock on\\nthe client’s body and places a lightly curved finger at the\\n6-o’clock position. He or she then pushes the skin clock-\\nwise around the face of the clock for one and one-quarter\\ncircles, maintaining a constant pressure. The client’s\\nbody is gently supported with the practitioner’s free\\nhand, which is placed opposite the hand making the cir-\\ncle. After each circular touch, the practitioner gently\\nslides the hand down the body and repeats the circle.\\nBenefits\\nAura therapy is generally designed to bring imbal-\\nances in the aura back into physical, mental, emotional,\\nand spiritual balance. The benefits can be subtle (like a\\ngeneral feeling of peace and well-being) or dramatic\\n(like experiencing a spiritual transformation or feelings\\nof ecstasy). Changes may be immediate or can occur\\nover several days. Repeated therapy sessions can main-\\ntain and deepen the aura energy balance.\\nPersons who have received therapeutic touch or\\nTellington touch from nurses frequently mention “com-\\nfort” or “humanizing of health care” as important benefits.\\nTherapeutic touch and Tellington touch appear to\\nbenefit patients in intensive care units (ICUs), who fre-\\nquently develop mild psychiatric disturbances from being\\nisolated and from the fact that ICU equipment interferes\\nwith normal human sensory perception. It is thought that\\nTT and Ttouch help to break down the patient’s feelings\\nof isolation and disconnection from other people.\\nDescription\\nTraditionally, an aura is a protective psychic and\\nspiritual energy field that surrounds the physical body.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 165\\nAura therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 165'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 182}, page_content='Energy from an aura is usually not static. It is constantly\\nflowing, flashing, vibrating, expanding, and decreasing.\\nThe colors detected usually indicate emotions, such as:\\n• lavender and purple for spirituality\\n• red/orange for sexual passion\\n• white for truth\\n• rose or pink for love\\n• red for anger\\n• yellow for intellect\\nSlow, deep breaths expand the aura while fast, shallow\\nbreaths decrease it. Spaces or gaps in the aura usually signi-\\nfy disease. These gaps often appear near the affected area,\\nsuch as around the heart to signify heart disease. In gener-\\nal, auras have seven levels. Physical and ethereal auras ex-\\ntend up to a foot from the body, imagination and emotional\\nauras extend about two feet, while the mental, archetypal\\n(destiny), and spiritual auras extend about three feet.\\nThere seems to be a general consensus among aura\\ntherapists that more than one session is required for opti-\\nmal balancing. Many suggest three sessions within two\\nor three weeks. The first session focuses on the physical\\naura, the next on the emotional, and the third on the spir-\\nitual. Once the aura levels are in balance, follow-up ses-\\nsions are encouraged every six months to a year. Aura\\ntherapy is not covered by medical insurance. The cost\\ncan range from $50 to $100 or more per session.\\nPreparations\\nNo advance preparation is required. However, many\\naura readers and therapists say the patient should have a\\ngenuine desire for better health and happiness. Also,\\nmany therapists suggest patients abstain from recreation-\\nal drugs, alcohol, and sex for several days before the\\ntherapy for a better sense of clarity and focus.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are no known precautions associated with\\naura therapy.\\nSide effects\\nNo negative side effects associated with aura thera-\\npy have been reported, although a small minority of pa-\\ntients treated with TT or Ttouch report feeling uncom-\\nfortable with being touched by strangers.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nAura color therapy is considered a New Age treat-\\nment and is not generally accepted as valid by the con-\\nventional medical community. Skeptics argue that there\\nare no scientific studies documenting the benefits of aura\\ntherapy or the existence of a human biofield. Most re-\\nports of the benefits of aura color therapy are anecdotal\\nand appear in New Age journals and magazines.\\nAlthough therapeutic touch has become a popular\\nalternative/complementary approach in some schools of\\nnursing in the United States and Canada, acceptance by\\nthe mainstream medical community varies. Many hospi-\\ntals permit nurses and staff to perform TT on patients at\\nno extra charge. On the other hand, however, therapeutic\\ntouch became national news in April 1998 when an ele-\\nmentary-school student carried out research for a science\\nproject that questioned its claims. Twenty-one TT practi-\\ntioners with experience ranging from one to 27 years\\nwere blindfolded and asked to identify whether the in-\\nvestigator’s hand was closer to their right hand or their\\nleft. Placement of the investigator’s hand was determined\\nby flipping a coin. The TT practitioners were able to\\nidentify the correct hand in only 123 (44%) of 280 trials,\\na figure that could result from random chance alone. De-\\nbate about the merits of TT filled the editorial pages of\\nthe Journal of the American Medical Association for\\nnearly a year after the news reports.\\nTellington touch training is offered by some schools\\nof veterinary medicine in the United States, and as of\\n2003 is also offered in continuing education programs in\\nschools of nursing. It appears to be gaining wider sup-\\nport from the mainstream medical community as a useful\\ntechnique in calming patients facing unpleasant or\\npainful procedures. One study found that patients await-\\ning venipuncture who received Ttouch were more re-\\nlaxed before the procedure and had significantly less dis-\\ncomfort afterward.\\nTraining & certification\\nNo formal training or certification is required to\\npractice aura reading, aura color therapy, TT, or Ttouch.\\nHowever, a number of alternative medicine and New\\nAge healing schools offer formal training and certifica-\\ntion.

The\\nancient Egyptians and Greeks believed that working with\\nthe ears could influence health. Hippocrates, the Greek fa-\\nther of medicine, mentioned a point on the ear that could\\nbe operated on as a birth control measure in men. In Eu-\\nrope in the Middle Ages, doctors prescribed surgery on a\\nparticular spot on the ear for a condition called sciatica,\\nwhich causes nerve pain in the hips and thighs.\\nIn modern times, auriculotherapy has been advanced\\nby Paul Nogier of France. Beginning his work and ex-\\nperiments in the 1950s, Nogier laid out an intricate map\\nof points on the ear that correspond to the organs and\\nprocesses in the body. Nogier believed that the ear is\\nshaped like an upside down human fetus, and the\\nacupuncture points on the ear correspond to the body\\nparts of the fetus shape, with the earlobe representing the\\nhead. Nogier theorized that by stimulating these points\\non the ear, the corresponding organs and bodily process-\\nes would be stimulated by nerve impulses. Nogier also\\ntheorized that by measuring electrical impulses on the\\nskin of the ear, problems could be detected in the internal\\norgans, and therefore auriculotherapy could be used to\\ndiagnose illnesses. Nogier and many followers, includ-\\ning ear acupuncturists in America and China, conducted\\nscientific experiments in auriculotherapy, and showed\\nsome significant and surprising results in both treatment\\nand diagnosis of conditions. In 2002, a center in Maine\\nreceived a unique grant to study auriculotherapy for sub-\\nstance abuse. Although recognizing that acupuncture had\\nbeen used before for helping those with abuse, this study\\nsought to show that auriculotherapy’s effects on relax-\\nation response helped those abusing drugs and alcohol\\nbetter deal with the anxiety and life circumstances\\nthought to lead them to substance abuse.\\nBenefits\\nAuriculotherapy is a quick, inexpensive, and non-in-\\nvasive method of pain control. Ear acupuncture is also\\nused as anesthesia during medical procedures. It is used\\nfrequently to help people overcome drug, tobacco, and\\nalcohol addictions, and is used to treat chronic health\\nconditions and diseases.\\nDescription\\nAfter an initial exam and interview, auriculothera-\\npists begin treatment by checking the patient’s ears\\nclosely. Practitioners may palpate (feel) the ears with\\ntheir hands, and check for any irregularities or painful\\nspots. They may check for spots that are insensitive or\\nnumb by using cold or hot needles on the ear. They may\\nalso rely on electrical devices that measure skin resis-\\ntance at points on the ear.\\nSeveral techniques may be used during auriculother-\\napy. Acupuncture needles are typically extremely thin.\\nMore than one needle may be used at one time, inserted\\ndeeply, or just pricked slightly along the contours of the\\near. On some points, needles may be twisted or slanted\\nto create more healing effects. Needles may be left in\\nfrom a few minutes to half an hour or more.\\nAuriculotherapists may use permanent press nee-\\ndles. These small, tack-shaped needles may be attached\\nto the ear with a narrow band of tape for several days or\\nweeks. They are used for conditions that may require\\nconstant stimulation to acupuncture points on the ear,\\nsuch as addictions, chronic (long-lasting) infections, and\\nother health problems.\\nAuriculotherapists also practice electroacupuncture,\\nwhich utilizes electrical devices to send small electrical\\ncurrents into the ear or through the body. Electroacupunc-\\nture is used for conditions such as paralysis or nerve dam-\\nage in the body, drug and alcohol addictions, and chronic\\npain. Auriculotherapists may also employ bleeding, which\\nremoves one or two drops of blood at certain points on the\\near. Bleeding is used for health problems such as high\\nblood pressure, high cholesterol, or heart disease.\\nAuriculotherapy is generally performed once per\\nweek on patients for a sequence of several months, al-\\nthough the frequency of treatment depends on the patient\\nand condition. Treatment may last for several months.\\nThe initial visit to an acupuncturist is typically the most\\nexpensive, costing from $80 to $200. Follow-up visits\\nare less expensive, from $50 to $100 on average. Auricu-\\nlotherapists may also prescribe herbal and nutritional\\nremedies. Insurance coverage of acupunture fees varies,\\ndepending on individual policies.\\nPreparations\\nBefore treatment, an auriculotherapist may perform\\na thorough examination and interview the patient to de-\\ntermine health conditions and any precautions or adjust-\\nments that must be made. Acupuncturists often rely on\\npulse diagnosisand other diagnostic techniques before\\nand during treatment.\\nFor treatment, the patient should lie in a horizontal\\nposition on a comfortable surface in a calm, stress-free\\nenvironment. After treatment, the patient should be per-\\nmitted to lie down until feeling capable of leaving the\\npractitioner’s office.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2168\\nAuriculotherapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 168'),\n",

Odle\\nAutism\\nDefinition\\nAutism is a chronic and often severe disorder of\\nbrain functioning that begins during childhood. It is\\nmarked by problems with social contact, intelligence,\\nand language, coupled with ritualistic or compulsive be-\\nhavior, sensory integration and processing problems, and\\nstrange environmental responses.\\nDescription\\nAutism is a lifelong disorder that interferes with the\\nability to understand what is seen, heard, and touched.\\nThis can cause profound problems in personal behavior\\nAcupuncture needles should be sterilized before use.\\nThe ears should be disinfected before acupuncture as\\nwell, which is usually done with a cotton ball dipped in\\nrubbing alcohol.\\nPrecautions\\nAuriculotherapy, like all acupuncture, should not be\\nperformed on weak or exhausted patients, nor on those\\nwho are very hungry or have just eaten a meal or drunk\\nalcohol. Auriculotherapy should not be performed on\\npregnant women during the first two trimesters (six\\nmonths) of pregnancy, and afterwards only on very par-\\nticular points on the ear for pain control. Auriculotherapy\\nis not recommended for children under seven years old,\\nand should be performed with care on the elderly. Ear\\nacupuncture is to be avoided by those with anemia (low\\nred blood cell quantity in the blood). Patients with ner-\\nvous conditions should be thoroughly relaxed and pre-\\npared before treatment. For people that find acupuncture\\ndisagreeable, ear massage and acupressure may be\\npreferable to treatment with needles.\\nSide effects\\nSome patients may experience uncomfortable side\\neffects during or after acupuncture. Side effects that\\nmay occur after treatment include fainting,dizziness ,\\nnausea, numbness, headaches, sweating, or sharp pains\\nthroughout the body. These reactions may be due to\\nanxiety or because acupuncture needles have been in-\\nserted too deeply or in the wrong area. Side effects can\\nbe alleviated by removing the needles and allowing the\\npatient to lie down under supervision. Some side effects\\nthat occur during treatment, such as hot flashes , in-\\ncreased pulse, and temporarily increased symptoms, are\\nconsidered normal and usually disappear quickly.\\nTraining & certification\\nThe American Academy of Medical Acupuncture\\n(AAMA) was chartered in 1987 to support the education\\nand correct practice of physician-trained acupuncturists.\\nIts members must be either MDs or DOs who have com-\\npleted proper study of acupuncture techniques.\\nThe National Commission for Certification of\\nAcupuncturists (NCCA) conducts certification exams,\\npromotes national standards, and registers members.\\nMost states that license acupuncturists use the NCCA\\nstandards as certification.\\nThe American Association of Acupuncture and Ori-\\nental Medicine (AAAOM) is the largest organization for\\npractitioners, with more than 1,600 members.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 169\\nAutism\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAnesthesia—Method of pain control during med-\\nical procedures.\\nChronic—Referring to illness or condition that is\\nlong lasting.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 169'),\n",

(A/P Wide World Photos. Reproduced by permission.)\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAlthough the exact causes of autism are unknown,\\nmany possibilities have been proposed. Most experts\\nbelieve that several independent factors contribute to\\ndevelopment of autism. The number and combinations\\nof these factors probably differ from person to person.\\nResearch points to such precipitating conditions as fetal\\nalcohol syndrome, genetic connections (as with identi-\\ncal twins), brain stem defects,lead poisoning ,a  n e r -\\nvous system defect, infections, food and inhalant aller-\\ngies, infant vaccination reactions, and digestive system\\ndeficiencies.\\nFurther studies point to major disturbances in the\\nbody chemistry of children with autism. Disruption is\\nmost often found in fatty acid metabolism, electrolyte\\nbalances, problems with digestive functioning, pro-\\nduction of red and white blood cells, and the body’s\\nbalance of minerals. Diseases that may trigger autistic\\nbehavior include rubella in the pregnant mother,\\ntuberous sclerosis, candiasis infection, fragile X syn-\\ndrome, encephalitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), a se-\\nvere form of a herpes simplex infection, and untreated\\nphenylketonuria.\\nand in the ability to relate to others. A person with\\nautism must learn how to communicate normally and\\nhow to relate to people, objects, and events. However,\\nnot all patients suffer the same degree of impairment.\\nThe severity of the condition varies between individuals,\\nranging from the person with extremely unusual and ag-\\ngressive behavior to one with something resembling a\\nmild personality disorder or a learning disability.\\nAutism occurs in as many as one in 1,000 children,\\nand incidence is rapidly increasing. It is found three to\\nfour times more often in boys than in girls. The condi-\\ntion occurs around the world in all races and all social\\nbackgrounds. Autism usually is evident in the first three\\nyears of life, although in some children it is difficult to\\npinpoint when the problem actually takes hold. Often,\\nthe condition may not be diagnosed until the child enters\\nschool. A person with autism can have symptoms rang-\\ning from mild to severe.\\nTwo subgroups of autism have recently been ex-\\nplained by clinicians. Those with essential autism, as de-\\nfined by diagnostic tests, appear to have higher IQ scores\\nand fewer seizures than those with complex autism,\\nwhich offers a poorer outcome.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 170'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 187}, page_content='There also appears to be a strong genetic basis for\\nautism. In October 2001, the National Institutes of\\nHealth (NIH) reported that two regions of chromosomes\\ncontain genes involved with autism, and that two other\\nchromosomes had a weaker relation to autism-related\\ngenes. Genetically identical twins are much more likely\\nthan fraternal twins to both have autism if one is affect-\\ned. In a family with one autistic child, the chance of hav-\\ning another child with autism is about one in 20, much\\nhigher than in the normal population. Sometimes, rela-\\ntives of an autistic child have mild behaviors that look\\nvery much like autism, such as repetitive behaviors and\\nsocial or communication problems. Research also has\\nfound that some emotional disorders, such as manic de-\\npression , occur more often in families of a child with\\nautism. At least one group of researchers has also found\\na link between an abnormal gene and autism. The gene\\nmay be just one of at least three to five genes that inter-\\nact in some way to cause the condition. Scientists sus-\\npect that a faulty gene or genes might make a person vul-\\nnerable to develop autism in the presence of other fac-\\ntors, such as chemical imbalance, infection, or a lack of\\noxygen at birth.\\nAutism affects the way in which the brain uses or\\ntransmits information. Studies have found abnormalities\\nin several parts of the brains of those with autism that al-\\nmost certainly occurred during fetal development. The\\nproblem may be centered in the parts of the brain re-\\nsponsible for processing language and information from\\nthe senses. Profound problems with social interactions\\nare the most common symptoms of autism. Infants with\\nthe disorder will not cuddle, avoid eye contact, and in\\ngeneral do not seem to like or require physical contact or\\naffection. Often, the child will not form attachments to\\nparents or the rest of the family. The child may not speak\\nat all, or speak very little and may show bizarre patterns\\nof speech, such as endlessly repeating words or phrases.\\nAbout 10% of those with autism have an exceptional\\nability in particular areas, such as mathematics, memory,\\nart, or music.\\nMost autistic children appear to be mentally retard-\\ned to at least some degree. Bizarre behavior patterns are\\nvery common and may include repeated mimicking of\\nthe actions of others, complex rituals, screaming fits,\\nrhythmic rocking, arm flapping, finger twiddling, and\\ncrying without tears. Many of these children may react\\nto sounds by banging their head or flapping fingers.\\nSome less affected autistic adults who have written\\nbooks about their childhood experiences report that\\nsounds were often excruciatingly painful to them, forc-\\ning them to withdraw from the environment or to try to\\ncope by withdrawing into their own invented world. A\\ncommon characteristic of individuals with autism is an\\ninsistence on sameness. There may be strong reactions to\\nchanges in food, clothing, and routines.\\nDiagnosis\\nAutism is diagnosed by obtaining a developmental\\nhistory of the child and observing and evaluating the\\nchild’s behavior, communication skills, and social inter-\\nactions. Because the symptoms of autism are so varied,\\nthe condition may go undiagnosed for some time. There\\nis no medical test for autism. The condition is often\\nmissed, especially in mild cases or when additional hand-\\nicaps are present. Special screening tools help physicians\\ndiagnose the condition. Medical tests are sometimes used\\nto rule out other possible causes of autistic symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nEarly intervention proves critical in managing\\nautism. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)\\nsays that many parents have chosen alternative therapies\\nwhen more traditional therapies do not produce desired\\nresults. Among therapies mentioned in the group’s report\\nare nutritional supplements, elimination diets, immune\\nglobulin therapy, and secretin (a hormone) therapy.\\nThere is often a strong nutritional dysfunction in-\\nvolved in autism. A major overhaul of the child’s diet\\nshould be done, but very gradually. A healthy diet of\\nwhole foods with no preservatives or additives, including\\nfood dyes, is recommended. Autistic children may have\\nparticular difficulty handling Nutrasweet and monosodi-\\num glutamate (MSG), as these chemicals may further in-\\nterfere with already disrupted nerve impulses. Processed\\nfoods such as white flour, white sugar, margarine, and\\nhydrogenated fats should be avoided because they inter-\\nfere with the stability of blood chemistry.\\nMany autistic children may be unable to effectively\\nbreak down the protein in grains such as wheat, barley,\\nand oats, called gluten, and the protein in milk called ca-\\nsein. Overgrowths of Candida albicans may be present\\nand should be tested for and treated. Testing should also\\nbe done for food, chemical, and inhalant allergies. Di-\\ngestive functioning should be tested and monitored. Ex-\\ntensive testing should be done for blood levels of chemi-\\ncals in the body, as well. Allergens should be subse-\\nquently removed from the diet and environment; further\\ndietary changes should be made to correct chemical im-\\nbalances. Possible gut and immune system dysfunction\\nshould also be addressed.\\nStudies have shown that supplementation with mega-\\ndoses of vitamin B6 together with magnesium improves\\neye contact, speech, and behavior problems.

A B-complex vitamin is probably\\nthe best way to give B6, due to the interdependent func-\\ntioning of the B vitamins. Zinc and vitamin C supple-\\nmentation is also recommended.

Autism is a complex condition. A practitioner\\nwho has already worked with cases of autism successfully\\nwill be able to offer a comprehensive treatment plan.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nMost experts recommend a complex treatment regi-\\nmen for autism that begins early in life and continues\\nthrough the teenage years. Behavioral therapies are used\\nin conjunction with medications and special diets. Be-\\ncause the symptoms vary so widely from one person to the\\nnext, there is not a single approach that works best for\\nevery person. Interventions include special training in\\nmusic, listening, vision, speech and language, and senses.\\nSensory integration training may be used to normalize\\nsensory functions. Training to change aberrant behaviors\\nshould be started as early in the autistic child’s life as pos-\\nsible, since early intervention appears to have the most in-\\nfluence on brain development and functioning. A child\\nwith autism is able to learn best in a specialized, struc-\\ntured program that emphasizes individualized instruction.\\nNo single medication has yet proved highly effec-\\ntive for the major features of autism. However, a variety\\nof drugs can control self-injurious, aggressive, and other\\nbehaviors. Drugs also can control epilepsy , which af-\\nflicts up to 20% of people with autism. Types of recom-\\nmended medication may include stimulants, such as\\nmethylphenidate (Ritalin); antidepressants, such as\\nfluroxamine (Luvox); opiate blockers, such as naltrexone\\n(ReVia); antipsychotics; and tranquilizers.\\nExpected results\\nStudies show that people with autism can improve\\nsignificantly with proper treatment. While there is no\\ncure, the negative behaviors of autism can be made to\\nimprove. Earlier generations placed autistic children in\\ninstitutions; now, even severely disabled children can be\\nhelped to eventually become more responsive to others.\\nChildren with autism usually can learn to better under-\\nstand and deal with the world around them. Some can\\neven lead nearly mainstream lives.\\nPrevention\\nThe mechanisms of autism are poorly understood.\\nThere is currently no known method of prevention for\\nthe condition. However, there is much debate as to what\\npart the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccina-\\ntion and the diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT)\\nvaccination may play in the onset of autism.

In Sanskrit, ayur means life or liv-\\ning, and veda means knowledge, so Ayurveda has been\\ndefined as the “knowledge of living” or the “science of\\nlongevity.” Ayurvedic medicine utilizes diet,detoxifica-\\ntion and purification techniques, herbal and mineral\\nremedies, yoga, breathing exercises, meditation , and\\nmassage therapy as holistic healing methods. Ayurvedic\\nmedicine is widely practiced in modern India and has\\nbeen steadily gaining followers in the West.\\nOrigins\\nAyurvedic medicine originated in the early civiliza-\\ntions of India some 3,000-5,000 years ago. It is men-\\ntioned in the Vedas, the ancient religious and philosophi-\\ncal texts that are the oldest surviving literature in the\\nworld, which makes Ayurvedic medicine the oldest sur-\\nviving healing system. According to the texts, Ayurveda\\nwas conceived by enlightened wise men as a system of\\nliving harmoniously and maintaining the body so that\\nmental and spiritual awareness could be possible. Med-\\nical historians believe that Ayurvedic ideas were trans-\\nported from ancient India to China and were instrumen-\\ntal in the development of Chinese medicine.\\nToday, Ayurvedic medicine is used by 80% of the\\npopulation in India. Aided by the efforts of Deepak\\nChopra and the Maharishi, it has become an increasing-\\nly accepted alternative medical treatment in America\\nduring the last two decades. Chopra is an M.D. who has\\nwritten several bestsellers based on Ayurvedic ideas. He\\nalso helped develop the Center for Mind/Body Medicine\\nin La Jolla, California, a major Ayurvedic center that\\ntrains physicians in Ayurvedic principles, produces\\nherbal remedies, and conducts research and documenta-\\ntion of its healing techniques.\\nBenefits\\nAccording to the original texts, the goal of Ayurveda\\nis prevention as well as promotion of the body’s own ca-\\npacity for maintenance and balance. Ayurvedic treatment\\nis non-invasive and non-toxic, so it can be used safely as\\nan alternative therapy or alongside conventional therapies.\\nAyurvedic physicians claim that their methods can also\\nhelp stress-related, metabolic, and chronic conditions.\\nAyurveda has been used to treat acne, allergies,asthma,\\nanxiety, arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, colds, coli-\\ntis, constipation, depression, diabetes, flu, heart disease,\\nhypertension, immune problems, inflammation, insom-\\nnia, nervous disorders, obesity, skin problems, and ulcers.\\nAyurvedic physicians seek to discover the roots of a\\ndisease before it gets so advanced that more radical treat-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 173\\nAyurvedic medicine\\nKapha\\nWater & Earth\\nPitta\\nFire & Water\\nVata\\nAir & Ether\\nThe three basic physiological principles or doshas.\\nIllustration by GGS Information Services, Inc.

Food, water, air, etc., are only the media through\\nwhich the prana is carried.”\\nIn Ayurveda, there are five basic elements that contain\\nprana: earth, water, fire, air, and ether. These elements in-\\nteract and are further organized in the human body as\\nthree main categories or basic physiological principles in\\nthe body that govern all bodily functions known as the\\ndoshas. The three doshas are vata, pitta, and kapha. Each\\nperson has a unique blend of the three doshas, known as\\nthe person’s prakriti, which is why Ayurvedic treatment is\\nalways individualized. In Ayurveda, disease is viewed as a\\nstate of imbalance in one or more of a person’s doshas,\\nand an Ayurvedic physician strives to adjust and balance\\nthem, using a variety of techniques.\\nThe vata dosha is associated with air and ether, and\\nin the body promotes movement and lightness. Vata peo-\\nple are generally thin and light physically, dry-skinned,\\nand very energetic and mentally restless. When vata is\\nout of balance, there are often nervous problems, hyper-\\nactivity, sleeplessness, lower back pains, and headaches.\\nPitta is associated with fire and water. In the body, it is\\nresponsible for metabolism and digestion. Pitta characteris-\\ntics are medium-built bodies, fair skin, strong digestion,\\nand good mental concentration. Pitta imbalances show up\\nas anger and aggression and stress-related conditions like\\ngastritis, ulcers, liver problems, and hypertension.\\nThe kapha dosha is associated with water and earth.\\nPeople characterized as kapha are generally large or\\nheavy with more oily complexions. They tend to be slow,\\ncalm, and peaceful. Kapha disorders manifest emotional-\\nly as greed and possessiveness, and physically as obesity,\\nfatigue, bronchitis, and sinus problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nIn Ayurvedic medicine, disease is always seen as an\\nimbalance in the dosha system, so the diagnostic process\\nstrives to determine which doshas are underactive or over-\\nactive in a body. Diagnosis is often taken over a course of\\ndays in order for the Ayurvedic physician to most accu-\\nrately determine what parts of the body are being affected.\\nTo diagnose problems, Ayurvedic physicians often use\\nlong questionnaires and interviews to determine a person’s\\ndosha patterns and physical and psychological histories.\\nAyurvedic physicians also intricately observe the pulse,\\ntongue, face, lips, eyes, and fingernails for abnormalities\\nor patterns that they believe can indicate deeper problems\\nin the internal systems. Some Ayurvedic physicians also\\nuse laboratory tests to assist in diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nAyurvedic treatment seeks to re-establish balance and\\nharmony in the body’s systems. Usually the first method of\\nments are necessary. Thus, Ayurveda seems to be limited\\nin treating severely advanced conditions, traumatic in-\\njuries, acute pain, and conditions and injuries requiring\\ninvasive surgery. Ayurvedic techniques have also been\\nused alongside chemotherapy and surgery to assist pa-\\ntients in recovery and healing.\\nDescription\\nKey ideas\\nTo understand Ayurvedic treatment, it is necessary\\nto have an idea how the Ayurvedic system views the\\nbody. The basic life force in the body is prana, which is\\nalso found in the elements and is similar to the Chinese\\nnotion of chi. As Swami Vishnudevananda, a yogi and\\nexpert, put it, “Prana is in the air, but is not the oxygen,\\nnor any of its chemical constituents.

Methods of detoxification include therapeutic\\nvomiting, laxatives, medicated enemas, fasting, and\\ncleansing of the sinuses. Many Ayurvedic clinics combine\\nall of these cleansing methods into intensive sessions\\nknown as panchakarma. Panchakarma can take several\\ndays or even weeks and they are more than elimination\\ntherapies. They also include herbalized oil massage and\\nherbalized heat treatments. After purification, Ayurvedic\\nphysicians use herbal and mineral remedies to balance the\\nbody as well. Ayurvedic medicine contains a vast knowl-\\nedge of the use of herbs for specific health problems.\\nAyurvedic medicine also emphasizes how people\\nlive their lives from day to day, believing that proper\\nlifestyles and routines accentuate balance, rest, diet, and\\nprevention. Ayurveda recommends yoga as a form of ex-\\nercise to build strength and health, and also advises mas-\\nsage therapy and self-massage as ways of increasing cir-\\nculation and reducing stress. Yogic breathing techniques\\nand meditation are also part of a healthy Ayurvedic regi-\\nmen, to reduce stress and improve mental energy.\\nOf all treatments, though, diet is one of the most basic\\nand widely used therapies in the Ayurvedic system. An\\nAyurvedic diet can be a very well planned and individual-\\nized regimen. According to Ayurveda, there are six basic\\ntastes: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and astringent.

Herbal treatments may cost from\\n$10 to $50 per month, and are often available from health\\nfood or bulk herb stores. Some clinics offer panchakarma, the\\nintensive Ayurvedic detoxification treatment, which can in-\\nclude overnight stays for up to several weeks.

Usually it is due to poor hygiene, but\\nit can be an indication of underlying health problems.\\nDescription\\nBad breath is likely to be experienced by most\\nadults and many children, at least occasionally. Some\\npeople are strongly convinced that bad breath is present\\nwhen it is not. Bad breath can have a significant impact\\non a person’s social and professional life.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAccumulation of plaque on the teeth is a major\\ncause of bad breath. Plaque is a mucus film that mixes\\nwith food particles, saliva, and bacterial residue in the\\nmouth. Bad breath can also be caused by any number\\nof other problems. These include sores in the mouth,\\ninfected tonsils, tooth or gum disease , fermentation of\\nfood particles in the mouth, sinus infections , and\\nbadly cleaned dentures. Conditions that may cause\\nbad breath are not only limited to the oral and nasal\\nareas. Other possible sources of the problem might be\\nindigestion, lung infection, kidney failure, tuberculo-\\nsis, syphilis , liver disease, stomach and intestinal\\nproblems, stress , dehydration, zinc deficiency, and\\ncancer.\\nCigarette smoking can also lead to bad breath, not\\nonly in the smoker, but also in someone constantly ex-\\nposed to secondhand smoke. A diet high in fats, spicy\\nfoods, or one that includes coffee may contribute to un-\\npleasant breath odors. Medications causing dry mouth\\nor dehydration may also be a source of problems, since\\nthe flow of saliva helps clean out the mouth. Antihista-\\nmines, decongestants, antidepressants, anti-anxiety med-\\nications, diuretics, and some heart medications may have\\na dehydrating effect, and could be a cause of bad breath.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe easiest way to determine if one has bad breath is\\nto ask a friend who is trustworthy and discrete, or to ask a\\ndoctor or dentist. A test that can be attempted on one’s\\nown, is to cup a hand over the mouth, exhale, and then in-\\nhale through the nose while smelling the breath. A physi-\\ncal examination by a doctor or dentist may be used to di-\\nagnose other problems that may be causing the bad breath.\\nTreatment\\nLeaves of parsley , Petroselinum crispum; winter-\\ngreen, Gaultheria procumbens; or peppermint, Mentha\\npiperita; can be chewed to freshen the breath by the in-\\ntroduction of their aromatic substances into the lungs. A\\nstrong tea made of Echinacea spp.; myrrh, Commiphora\\nmolmol; and bloodroot, Sanguinaria canadensis; can be\\nused as a daily mouthwash. Fresh apples, citrus fruits,\\nand celery are also good foods for helping to clean out\\nthe mouth. Possible homeopathic remedies that may be\\nuseful for bad breath include Nux vomica and Kali phos-\\nphoricum. Supplementing with zinc and vitamin C may\\nalso be of benefit.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe most effective treatment of bad breath is to treat\\nthe cause. If bad breath is a continuing problem or there\\nare other symptoms, such as bleeding gums, a doctor or\\ndentist should be consulted.

A physician should be consulted any time a\\nchange in medication is planned.\\nExpected results\\nMost bad breath can be treated successfully with\\ngood oral hygiene or medical care. Occasionally, a per-\\nson may develop delusional or obsessive behavior re-\\ngarding breath odor problems, and mental health coun-\\nseling may be appropriate.\\nPrevention\\nA healthy diet, high in fresh fruits and vegetables\\nand whole grains, should be eaten. Processed foods such\\nas sugar and white bread and grains contribute to plaque\\nformation and should be avoided. Spicy foods such as\\nonions, peppers,garlic, pastrami, salami, pepperoni, an-\\nchovies, and others should be avoided. Plenty of water\\nshould be consumed throughout the day to avoid dehy-\\ndration and dry mouth. Water should be consumed after\\ntaking any food or drink to wash away residues that may\\naccumulate with plaque.\\nThe teeth should be brushed and flossed daily after\\nmeals. Toothbrushes should be changed monthly, since\\nthere may be a tendency for bacteria to accumulate on\\nthem. Baking soda is a good choice to use for cleaning\\nthe teeth when bad breath is a problem. The baking soda\\nmakes the mouth pH less hospitable to odor-causing bac-\\nteria. Gentle brushing of the tongue should also be in-\\ncluded in the routine of daily oral hygiene, since the\\ntongue itself may harbor tiny particles of food. A device\\ncalled a tongue blade can be useful for cleaning the\\ntongue. It may be available from a store that sells Asian\\nor Middle Eastern products. An oral irrigation device,\\nsuch as a Water Pik, is recommended to more thoroughly\\nremove food and debris from the teeth. Mouthwashes are\\noften helpful, especially those containing zinc. A dentist\\nshould regularly check the health of the gums and teeth\\nfor disease. A dental hygienist should clean the teeth reg-\\nularly, especially if there is an increased tendency to\\nform plaque.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nRosenberg, M. “Clinical Assessment of Bad Breath: Current\\nConcepts.” Journal of the American Dental Association\\n127 (April 1996): 475-482.\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Dental Association.

The cultivated North Ameri-\\ncan variety can grow to heights of 100 ft (30 m).\\nThe herb’s name derives from the ancient region of\\nGilead in Palestine, known for the great healing powers\\nof its balm. Balm of Gilead is mentioned several times in\\nthe Bible (e.g., Jeremiah 8:22). The writings of Pliny the\\nElder indicate that the tree was brought to Rome in the\\nfirst century A.D. The historian Josephus recorded that\\nthe Queen of Sheba made a gift of balm of Gilead to\\nKing Solomon.\\nGeneral use\\nIn addition to being used in the composition of per-\\nfumes, balm of Gilead is used to soothe ailments of the\\nmucous membranes. It is taken internally to ease coughs\\nand respiratory infections . The balm is also said to re-\\nlieve laryngitis and sore throats. It can also be combined\\nwith coltsfoot to make a cough suppressant.\\nPreparations\\nThe resin of the balsam poplar tree is collected\\nwhen it seeps out of the tree during the summer months.\\nSeepage increases when humidity levels are high.

It is also commonly grown in North America. Its\\nclose relative,Berberis aquifolium , is a native of North\\nAmerica, and is also known as Oregon grape. Native\\nAmericans originally taught settlers its value as a medic-\\ninal herb. Two other species of the plant, Nepalese and\\nIndian barberry, are native to those areas and possess\\nsimilar qualities.\\nBarberry is a perennial herb that is usually around 8\\nft (2.4 m) tall, but can grow up to 10 ft (3 m) high. It\\nbears yellow flowers, red or black berries, and small\\nrounded fleshy leaves. It flourishes in dry sandy soil, and\\nprefers a sunny location. Research has established that\\nthe active alkaloids in barberry belong to the isoquinoline\\nfamily. They are berberine, berbamine, oxyacanthine,\\nbervulcine, columbamine, isotetrandrine, jatrorrhizine,\\nmagnoflorine, and vulvracine. Other components include\\nresin, tannin, and chelidonic acid, among others.\\nGeneral use\\nBarberry and other berberine-containing plants have\\nbeen used throughout history for their medicinal proper-\\nties. Chinese medicine has records of such use dating back\\nover 3,000 years. In addition to the fact that these plants\\nhave been tried and tested over time, recent research has\\nindeed confirmed what herbalists have been teaching for\\nmillennia—berberine has remarkable properties.\\nThe berries of the barberry plant are traditionally\\nused to make jams and jellies, and the plant is used to\\nmake a dye. However, its culinary use is only minor\\ncompared to its importance as a member of the herbal\\nMateria Medica.\\nThe medicinal actions of barberry are traditionally\\nclassified as being cholagogue, hepatic, antiemetic, bitter\\nand laxative. Its main active constituent, berberine, has\\nrecently been the subject of much research (it is the ac-\\ntive constituent of a number of valuable herbs, barberry\\nand goldenseal being two important examples), and has\\nbeen proven effective against a variety of ailments.\\nBarberry is chiefly valued as an efficient liver\\ncleanser, due to its ability to correct liver function and\\npromote the flow of bile. It is good for heartburn, stom-\\ntraces of salicylic acid, can be combined with willow and\\nrosemary and used as a analgesic to relieve fevers, mus-\\ncle aches and arthritic pain.\\nPrecautions\\nThe sale and use of herbs as medicines, including\\nbalm of Gilead, are not regulated by government\\nagencies. Therefore, consumers should exercise cau-\\ntion in purchasing and using herbs in this manner.\\nConsultation with a physician or pharmacist is always\\nrecommended.\\nSide effects\\nIn general, balm of Gilead is safe to use in small\\namounts for coughs and other minor health problems.\\nSome people, however, may have allergic reactions to\\nthe resin. In addition, patients with kidney and liver dis-\\nease, as well as pregnant and nursing women, should\\navoid the internal use of balm of Gilead.\\nInteractions\\nBalm of Gilead has no known interactions with stan-\\ndard pharmaceutical preparations.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nElias, Jason, and Shelagh Ryan Masline.

As a grass, it is also known as a distichon,\\nmeaning that it grows in two separate ranks, or rows. The\\nrows of barley grass are parallel to the central axis, form-\\ning a loose sheath over the stem, which is sometimes\\ncalled the culm. This stem is hollow and jointed, and the\\nseeds are ellipitical and furrowed. The barley plant, an\\nannual that requires reseeding each year, reaches a\\nheight of up to 3 ft (about 1 m). The plant has an exten-\\nsive history in human and animal nutrition. As a nutri-\\ntional supplement, it is preferable to use young barley\\nplants that have not yet developed seeds.\\nGeneral use\\nThe barley plant appears to have been used by the\\nancient Egyptians, Romans, and Vikings. It is believed\\nthat Columbus brought it to the Americas in 1493. Bar-\\nley seeds have been used in both human nutrition and\\nmedicine. When the seeds are boiled, they release a thick\\nsubstance that soothes sore throats. Barley seeds are used\\nfor the preparation of malt extract, which has a high\\nsugar content that makes it suitable as a flavoring agent\\nin pharmaceutical preparations.\\nMarketers make a number of claims regarding bar-\\nley grass, including:\\n• It is the only vegetation on earth that can supply sole\\nnutritional support from birth to old age.\\n• Barley grass juice contains nutrients such as vitamins C\\nand E, which are much more potent together than when\\ntaken separately.\\n• Barley grass is high in calcium , iron, all essential\\namino acids , vitamin C, the flavonoids, vitamin B12,\\nand a number of enzymes and minerals.\\n• Barley grass can be used to treat disorders of the stom-\\nach and duodenum; pancreatitis ; and as an anti-in-\\nflammatory agent.\\n• Barley grass contains superoxide dismutase (SOD), a\\npowerful antioxidant enzyme that protects the cells\\nagainst toxic free radicals.\\nAlthough not substantiated, one source has claimed\\nthat barley grass is good for the following conditions:\\n• skin diseases\\n• hepatitis\\n• asthma\\n• anemia\\n• diabetes\\n• arthritis\\n• obesity\\nBarley grass contains vitamins, particularly B vita-\\nmins, as well minerals such as potassium, calcium, iron,\\nphosphorus , and magnesium . Enzymes contained in\\nthe plant include SOD and nitrogen reductase. The latter\\nreduces nitrogen—an element commonly found in pro-\\ntein—in a biological process. Although barley grass con-\\ntains enzymes, the health benefits of these substances re-\\nmain unclear. Enzymes are proteins, which are normally\\nbroken down into their component chemicals during di-\\ngestion. However, the enzymes found in raw foods re-\\nmain technologically unprotected from normal digestive\\nprocesses. The medical literature is not consistent on\\nwhether any SOD is actually absorbed intact through the\\ndigestive tract. In fact, the percentage absorbed may be\\nvery small. Techniques are being developed to encapsu-\\nlate enzymes into other molecules. This will allow the\\nenzymes to be absorbed intact, so that they will remain\\nactive following digestion.\\nBarley grass and other cereal grasses may or may\\nnot be useful sources of natural vitamins and minerals.\\nEvidence may be insufficient to justify claims that these\\nproducts improve physical health or cure disease. Barley\\ngrass has not been reviewed by the United States Food\\nand Drug Administration (FDA) or the German Commis-\\nsion E. Nutrient concentration in barley grass products\\nvaries with the conditions under which the plant is\\ngrown. Like other natural supplements, commercial bar-\\nley grass is not standardized; therefore, different crops\\ncontain varying amounts of nutrients. Young barley grass\\nplants appear to contain higher concentrations of nutri-\\nents than older plants.\\nOne well-publicized Chinese study reported that\\nbarley grass was beneficial in lowering cholesterol lev-\\nels in patients with type 2 diabetes. This may be due to\\nthe plant’s antioxidant abilities. Similar results were\\nachieved by other researchers who studied the antioxi-\\ndant effects of red wine and tomato juice.\\nOther health claims made for barley grass remain\\nunconfirmed. For example, chlorophyll, the pigment\\nfound in barley grass and all green plants, may have\\nsome antibacterial effects. Chlorophyll reportedly in-\\nhibits the growth of cancer cells under laboratory condi-\\ntions, but its value in human health is unknown.\\nSimilarly, the claim that barley grass can provide\\nfull nutrition is subject to dispute. One researcher found\\nthat people on a vegan diet that included barley grass\\nwere likely to show reduced levels of vitamin B12, and to\\nrequire supplementation with this essential nutrient.\\nPreparations\\nBarley grass is available in capsule, powder, and\\ntablet formulations. Capsules are sold in strengths of 470\\nmg, 475 mg, and 500 mg. Tablets are available in 350\\nmg and 500 mg strengths.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2184\\nBarley grass\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 184'),\n",

Thus, traditional ophthalmologists\\nblamed problems like nearsightedness on a failure of the\\nlens to properly focus, while Bates believed it was due to\\na dysfunction of the muscles surrounding the eyeball.\\nBates had come to this conclusion after performing eye\\nsurgery on cataract patients and finding that some of\\nthem could still see distance without glasses even though\\nhe had removed the lens from their eyes; therefore, he\\ndetermined that the lens did not play a role in refractive\\nerrors such as myopia.\\nAt this point, Bates broke from his counterparts and\\nbegan focusing his attention on the muscles surrounding\\nthe eye. He came to view eye problems as a result of\\npoor evolution, believing that the eye had not kept up\\nwith human progress and had not evolved to allow read-\\ning. He also blamed problems on artificial light, which\\nkept the eyes working longer hours each day than they\\nwere intended to. Bates developed a series of eye exer-\\ncises to retrain the optic muscles to solve this evolution-\\nary glitch.\\nBates believed that eye strain caused vision to dete-\\nriorate, and his treatment was simple: like any other\\nmuscles, the eye muscles need periods of rest and exer-\\ncise in order to achieve optimal performance. He focused\\non the functioning of the six small muscles that control\\nthe eye’s shape. When they become tense, they gradually\\ngrow weak and result in nearsightedness, farsightedness,\\nastigmatism, or “lazy eye.”\\nThe Bates method received acclaim several years\\nafter Bates’s death (1931), when author Aldous Huxley\\nboasted that after two months on the Bates program, he\\nwent from being almost blind to being able to read with-\\nout wearing glasses.\\nBenefits\\nAn advantage of the Bates method is that the treat-\\nment is relaxing. Also, if patients stick to the routine and\\neye improvement is gained, they may benefit by being able\\nto discard their corrective lenses, escaping a lifetime of\\ncosts for glasses, lenses, and contact solutions. The treat-\\nment is also much less invasive than refractive surgery,\\nwhich is costly and has risks, just like any other operation.\\nDescription\\nThe Bates method maintains that vision problems\\nare caused by physiological and psychological strains\\nand therefore cannot be corrected by wearing glasses. He\\nbelieved that a combination of rest and exercise would\\nmend the eyes and devised several exercises aimed at\\nstrengthening and retraining the eye muscles.\\nThe exercises themselves are simple, but Bates\\nstressed that it takes discipline and attention to detail in\\norder to achieve improvement. Some of the principal ex-\\nercises of the Bates method are described below.\\nPalming\\nPalming is aimed at calming the visual system. In\\nthis exercise, patients close their eyes and cover them\\nwith the palms of their hands, allowing the fingers to\\ncross on the forehead. The hands should be cupped so\\nthat no pressure is put on the eyeballs. Next, the patient\\nshould open his or her eyes and see if any light is getting\\nin. If so, the hands should be moved so that no light en-\\nters and then close the eyes again. The warmth of a per-\\nson’s hands, combined with blocking out all light, will\\nrelax a pair of tense eyeballs.\\nSitting at a table is a good palming position. A per-\\nson can place a cushion on the table on which to rest\\ntheir arms, and should check the height to be sure their\\nhands are not too high or too low. Lying on the back,\\nwith knees raised and feet flat on the floor, is also a good\\nposition. While palming, patients should imagine a re-\\nlaxing scene, such as a sunrise or ocean.\\nA description of the exercise posted on the Bates As-\\nsociation for Vision Education website suggests palming\\nin 5–10-minute sessions, at least once a day. If this is\\nfound unpleasant, a person can try mini-sessions, palm-\\ning for a period of 15 breaths, up to 20 times a day. Palm-\\ning may also help when the eyes become tired and bleary.\\nSwinging\\nSwinging is meant to train the eyes not to stare.\\nBates maintained that the rigidity of staring was bad for\\nthe eyes. To do this exercise, the patient should focus on\\na fixed object, then swing the head or the entire body\\nfrom side to side while keeping the object in view by\\nmoving the head instead of the eyes.\\nTest-card practice\\nBased on the idea that practice makes perfect, this\\nexercise involves practicing eye charts. Patients are\\nasked to focus on a letter, then close their eyes and visu-\\nalize the black letter for several seconds. After several\\nsessions, Bates maintains, the letters will appear blacker\\nand clearer.\\nSunning\\nSunning is aimed at reducing light sensitivity. Bates be-\\nlieved the sun has a therapeutic effect, so patients are asked\\nto close their eyes and face the sun. It is advised to sun only\\nin the morning or evening and only for short periods of time.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2186\\nBates method\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 186'),\n",

Traditional ophthalmol-\\nogists hold that the lens—not the eye muscles—is re-\\nsponsible for focus and therefore cannot be fixed\\nthrough a series of exercises. Traditional ophthalmolo-\\ngists believe that problems like nearsightedness are\\nanatomic conditions that cannot be fixed by strengthen-\\ning the eye muscles.\\nAs Philip Pollack noted in his book The Truth About\\nEye Exercises, Bates used testimonials and case histories\\ndepicting successful treatment as scientific proof his the-\\nory was sound. Pollack also lambasted Bates for describ-\\ning rare cases as the norm, using them as justification for\\nhis methods.\\nThe Bates method has not found widespread use\\nand is generally not accepted by the medical establish-\\nment. In his book Health Education Authority Guide to\\nComplementary Medicine and Therapies , A. Woodham\\ncautions that the medical consensus is that “eye exer-\\ncises can improve the sight in some cases, but these\\nneed a lot of dedication and perseverance. Do not ex-\\npect miracles.”\\nTraining & certification\\nNatural vision improvement techniques, such as the\\nBates method, are generally taught by behavioral op-\\ntometrists or vision therapists. Vision therapists may not\\nnecessarily be trained in optometry. It is possible, how-\\never, to find practicing optometrists trained by the Bates\\nAssociation for Vision Education, which offers courses\\non the method.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBates, W.

This exercise involves training the eyes\\nto focus on a single point, rather than an entire pic-\\nture. The eye has a point in the middle of the vision\\nfield where vision is sharpest. This exercise is aimed\\nat training people to look only at that point. Patients\\nare asked to look at an object piece by piece instead of\\ntrying to look at it in its entirety, which Bates main-\\ntains is beyond the physical capabilities of the eye.\\nBates believed that looking at an entire picture created\\nstrain, causing bad eyesight. This is not an exercise\\nper se, but rather something patients are asked to do\\nall day long.\\nColor days\\nThis involves spending the day focused on looking\\nfor a specific color. When looking at a color, patients are\\nasked to focus on the color, not the form. Colors change\\nevery day.\\nPeople interested in the Bates method can pay a pro-\\nfessional trained in the method to teach them the exercis-\\nes or they can simply read about them in books or on the\\ninternet for no cost. Bates believed that improvement\\nwould vary, depending on the degree of problem and a\\nperson’s devotion to doing the exercises.\\nPreparations\\nThere are no pre-therapy procedures.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople should be aware that the theory remains un-\\nproven. This method should not be a substitute for ap-\\npropriate medical treatment in the case of cataracts ,\\nglaucoma, and other eye diseases.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no side effects, but patients should be cau-\\ntious when using the sunning exercise, which may cause\\nsolar retinitis, or inflammation of the retina, causing per-\\nmanent damage.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThough the Bates method was devised a century\\nago, it has never been tested in a clinical setting.

All members of\\nthe bayberry family are classified botanically as Myri-\\ncaceae, and many varieties are found all over the world,\\nincluding Japan, South America, the West Indies, the\\nUnited Kingdom, and in the United States.\\nAmerican bayberry (Myrica cerifera) is a shrub that\\ngrows 3–8 ft (1–2.4 m) high. It is found in eastern North\\nAmerica, in marshes and bogs near sandy Atlantic\\ncoastal areas, as well as in similar areas along the shores\\nof the Great Lakes. American bayberry is the variety\\nmost often mentioned by herbalists.\\nAmerican bayberry and its British Isles cousin, Eng-\\nlish bog myrtle, are very alike in appearance, and grows\\nto a similar height. Foliage is evergreen and consists of\\nknife-blade shaped shiny leaves that have small spots on\\nthem. When crumpled in one’s hand, bayberry leaves\\nand its bark produce a pleasant, balsamic aroma. Howev-\\ner, they have a very bitter, astringent taste. The small\\nberries are in globular clusters at stem junctions, crusted\\nwith a greenish-white waxy substance sprinkled with\\nsmall black flecks. The exterior of bayberry root bark is\\nmottled, with smooth reddish-brown cork underneath.\\nGeneral use\\nBoth American bayberry and English bog myrtle,\\nbesides sharing a similar appearance, have similar medi-\\ncinal qualities. Like all bayberry varieties, they are clas-\\nsified as astringent herbs. Some evidence suggests that\\nthese herbs have antimicrobial capabilities, in that they\\nare able to prevent the development of pathogenic activi-\\nty from microbes, and are useful in regulating mucus in\\nthe body.\\nBoth varieties’ bark and roots contain starch, lignin,\\ngum, albumen, tannic and gallic acids, astringent resin, a\\nred coloring substance, a vaporous oil, and an acid simi-\\nlar to saponin. Powdered bayberry root is useful as a\\nbowel astringent in the treatment of diarrhea and colitis,\\na soothing and helpful gargle for the common cold or a\\nsore throat, and as a douche in the treatment of leukor-\\nrhea, an abnormal white or yellow mucoid discharge\\nfrom the vagina or cervix. In the Herbal Materia\\nMedica, bayberry root bark is classified as an astringent,\\na circulatory stimulant, as well as a diaphoretic, a reme-\\ndy which dilates superficial capillaries and induces per-\\nspiration, sometimes used to reduce fevers.\\nThe berries of both American bayberry and English\\nbog myrtle, when boiled in water, produce myrtle wax,\\nwhich is composed of stearic, palmitic, myristic, and\\noleaic acids. This is used in making bayberry-scented\\nsoaps and bayberry candles, which are fragrant, more\\nbrittle than bees’ wax candles, and are virtually smoke-\\nless. Four pounds of berries produce approximately one\\npound of wax. A briskly stimulating shaving cream was\\nalso made from this bayberry wax.\\nThe wax’s modern medicinal uses were first discov-\\nered and came into use in 1722, and included the mak-\\ning of surgeon’s soap plasters. The water that the berries\\nwere boiled in during wax extraction, when boiled down\\nto an extract, has been used in the North Country of\\nEngland and Scotland for centuries as a treatment for\\ndysentery. Narcotic properties are also attributed to bay-\\nberry wax.\\nIn A Modern Herbal , that the leaves of English bog\\nmyrtle were commonly used in France to induce both\\nmenstruationand abortion.\\nIn China, bayberry leaves are infused to make a tea\\nwhich is used both to relieve stomach problems, and as a\\ncordial, which is a stimulating medicine or drink.\\nA mouthwash particularly useful in inhibiting halli-\\ntosis can be made from either the powdered root or\\nleaves.\\nBayberry bark has traditionally been used to tan\\nleather and dye wool.\\nBayberry branches have been used in lieu of hops in\\nthe fermentation of gale beer, popular in northern Eng-\\nland, and reported to have more than the usual “thirst-\\nquenching” ability.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2188\\nBayberry\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 188'),\n",

Bedsores can range from mild inflammation to\\ndeep wounds that involve muscle and bone. Infections\\ncan be a serious complication to the condition.\\nDescription\\nBedsores are also called decubitus ulcers, pressure\\nulcers, or pressure sores. They often start out with shiny\\nred skin that becomes itchy or painful, then quickly blis-\\nters and deteriorates into open sores. Once there is a\\nbreak in the skin, there is a strong possibility of the sore\\nbecoming infected, causing further medical problems.\\nBedsores are most apt to develop over the bony promi-\\nnences of the ankles, the hip bones, the lower back, the\\nshoulders, the spinal column, the buttocks, and the heels\\nof the feet. Bedsores are most likely to occur in people\\nwho must use wheelchairs or who are confined to bed.\\nBedsores are medically categorized by stages:\\n• Stage I: The skin reddens, but it remains unbroken.\\n• Stage II: Redness, swelling, and blisters develop. There\\nis possibly peeling of the outer layer of the skin.\\n• Stage III: A shallow open wound develops on the skin.\\n• Stage IV: The sore deepens, spreading through layers\\nof skin and fat down to muscle tissue.\\n• Stage V: Muscle tissue is broken down.\\n• Stage VI: The underlying bone is exposed, and there is\\ndanger of severe damage and infection.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBedsores most often happen when the most superfi-\\ncial blood vessels are pressed against the skin and\\nsqueezed shut, closing off the flow of blood. If the sup-\\nply of blood to an area of skin is cut off for more than an\\nhour, the tissue will began to die due to lack of oxygen\\nand nutrients. Ordinarily, the layer of fat under the bony\\nareas of the skin helps keep the blood vessels from being\\ncompressed in this way. Also, people have a normal im-\\npulse to change positions frequently when they are sit-\\nting or lying down, so the blood supply is usually not\\nkept from any area of the skin for very long. Bedsores\\nare most likely to occur in people who have lost the pro-\\ntective fat layer or whose movement impulse is hindered.\\nFriction or rubbing from poorly fitted shoes or\\nclothing and wrinkled bedding often cause a sore to de-\\nvelop. Constant exposure to the moisture of urine, feces,\\nand perspiration may also cause the skin to deteriorate.\\nIn such cases there is an increased the risk of skin infec-\\ntion as well as sores.\\nRisk factors for bedsores:\\n• older than 60 years of age\\n• heart disease\\n• diabetes\\n• diminished tactile sensation\\n• incontinence\\n• malnutrition\\n• obesity\\n• paralysis or immobility\\n• poor circulation\\n• prolonged bed rest\\n• spinal cord injury\\n• anemia\\n• disuse atrophy\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2190\\nBedsores\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 190'),\n",

Any sign of reddening of the skin will be\\nclosely monitored.\\nTreatment\\nContrasting hot and cold local applications can increase\\ncirculation to problem areas and help flush out waste prod-\\nucts, speeding the healing process. Hot compresses should\\nbe applied for three minutes, followed by 30 seconds of cold\\ncompress application, repeating the cycle three times. The\\ncycle should always end with the cold compress. In addition,\\nzincand vitamins A, C, E, and B-complex should be taken\\nto help maintain healthy skin and repair injuries.\\nHerbal remedies\\nA poultice can be made of equal parts of powdered\\nslippery elm, Ulmus fulva; marsh mallow root, Althaea\\nofficinalis ; and Echinacea spp. The herbs should be\\nblended together with a small amount of hot water and\\napplied to the skin three or four times per day to relieve\\ninflammation. Poultices used on broken skin or infected\\nareas should never be reused.\\nAn infection-fighting rinse can be made by diluting\\ntwo drops of essential tea tree oil , Melaleuca spp., in\\neight ounces of water. This should be used to bathe the\\nwound when bandages are changed.\\nAn herbal tea made from Calendula officinalis can\\nbe used as an antiseptic wash and a wound healing agent.\\nCalendulacream can also be applied to the affected area.\\nA poultice made from goldenseal , Hydrastis\\ncanadensis, and water or goldenseal ointment can be ap-\\nplied to areas of inflammation several times per day to\\nheal the skin and prevent infection.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA healthcare provider should be consulted whenever\\na person develops bedsores. An emergency situation may\\nbe indicated if sores become tender, swollen, or warm to\\nthe touch, if the patient develops a fever, or if the sore\\nhas pus or a foul-smelling discharge.\\nFor mild bedsores, treatment basically involves re-\\nlieving pressure on the area and keeping the skin clean\\nand dry. When the skin is broken, a non-stick covering\\nmay be used. A saline solution is often used to clean the\\nwound site whenever a fresh bandage is applied. Disin-\\nfectants are applied if the site is infected. The doctor may\\nalso prescribe antibiotics, special dressings or drying\\nagents, and ointments to be applied to the wound. Heat\\nlamps are used quite successfully to dry out and heal the\\nsores. Warm whirlpool treatments are sometimes also rec-\\nommended for sores on the arm, hand, foot, or leg.\\nIn a procedure called debridement, a scalpel may be\\nused to remove dead tissue or other debris from the wound.\\nDeep sores that don’t respond to other therapy may require\\nskin grafts or plastic surgery. If there is a major infection,\\noral antibiotics may be given. If a bone infection, called os-\\nteomyelitis, develops or infection spreads through the\\nbloodstream, aggressive treatment with antibiotics over the\\ncourse of several weeks may be required.\\nExpected results\\nWith proper treatment, bedsores should begin to\\nheal two to four weeks after treatment begins. Left un-\\ntreated, however,gangrene, osteomyelitis, or a systemic\\ninfection may develop. In the United States, about\\n60,000 deaths a year are attributable to complications\\ncaused by bedsores.\\nPrevention\\nPrompt medical attention can prevent pressure sores\\nfrom deepening into more serious infections. People\\nwhose movement or sense of touch is limited by disabili-\\nty and disease should be monitored to insure that the skin\\nremains clean, dry, healthy. A bedridden patient should be\\nrepositioned at least once every two hours while awake. A\\nperson who uses a wheelchair should remember to shift\\nthe body’s position often or they should be helped to\\nreposition the body at least once an hour. To avoid injury,\\nit is important to lift, rather than drag, a person being\\nrepositioned. Wheelchair users should sit up as straight as\\npossible, with pillows behind the head and between the\\nlegs if needed. Donut-shaped seat cushions should not be\\nused because they may restrict blood flow.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 191'),\n",

It is a chronic condi-\\ntion that often resolves by itself before the teenage years.\\nDescription\\nOne of the major tasks of toddlerhood is to learn\\nhow to achieve conscious control over the timing of uri-\\nnation. Most children do not become fully toilet trained\\nuntil they are about two to four years old. Before then,\\nthe parts of the nervous system in charge of bladder con-\\ntrol are not fully developed and functional. In general,\\nboys take longer to learn to control their bladders than\\ngirls, and daytime bladder control is easier for a child\\nthan overnight bladder control. There is a genetic aspect\\nto bedwetting, so that parents who once had the condi-\\ntion often have children who wet the bed at night.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBedwetting is often due to the normal immaturity of\\nthe nervous system and the urinary system. For instance,\\nup to age six, bedwetting is often due to nothing more\\nthan the bladder having a small capacity. In addition, the\\nmuscles that control the opening and closing of the ure-\\nthra may not be sufficiently developed. Often it takes a\\nwhile for a child learn recognition of bladder fullness,\\nwaking up, and going to the toilet. In most cases, urinary\\ncapacity and control increase over time, and the bedwet-\\nting problem will eventually be outgrown.\\nSurprisingly, a big cause of bedwetting is lack of sleep.\\nIf a child is not sleeping enough hours, then there will be less\\nof the light, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and more pe-\\nriods of heavy, deep sleep. During the periods of deep sleep\\nsome children will have difficulty becoming aware of the\\nurge to urinate and awakening to go to the toilet.\\nBedwetting may be a sign of allergic reactions,\\nwhich end up irritating sphincter muscles around the ure-\\nthra. This contributes to a loss of bladder control during\\nsleep. Heavy snoring, mouth breathing, and night sweats\\nmay all be indications of the presence of allergies.\\nBedwetting can sometimes be due to emotional and\\npsychological stress, including major life changes such as\\nmoving or a divorce. This usually leads to the type of bed-\\nwetting called secondary enuresis, in which a previous\\nlevel of accomplishment with bladder control is lost. In\\nother words, a child who has been dry at night will sud-\\ndenly start wetting the bed again. This may indicate an un-\\nderlying problem such as constipation, diabetes, physical\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2192\\nBedwetting\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDisuse atrophy —Condition of muscles that have\\nlost size, strength, and function due to lack of mo-\\nbility.\\nGangrene —A serious condition where there is\\ndecay or death of an organ, tissue, or bone caused\\nby a lack of oxygen and nutrients and by bacterial\\ninfections.\\nIncontinence —Inability to control bladder or\\nbowel movements.\\nInflammation —An immune reaction to tissue in-\\njury or damage, usually characterized by pain,\\nswelling and redness.\\nPoultice—Moistened herbs applied directly to a\\nsite of injury or infection.\\nTactile sense —Receiving information about the\\nbody and the environment via contact with the\\nskin.

Secondary enuresis also frequently occurs in\\nchildren who are being physically or sexually abused. A\\npediatrician should be consulted if the condition persists.\\nOnly about 1% of bedwetting is caused by a serious\\nunderlying problem. If the following symptoms are pre-\\nsent, a pediatrician or a pediatric urologist should be\\nconsulted:\\n• straining during urination\\n• a burning feeling or other discomfort during urination\\n• constant or recurrent dribbling of urine\\n• cloudy or pink urine\\n• bloodstains or other discharge on underpants or night-\\nclothes\\n• an unpleasant urine odor\\n• onset of abdominal pain, backache, or fever\\n• constant thirst, especially at night\\n• sudden loss of bladder control previously mastered\\n• a child over the age of two who still shows no signs of\\nbeing ready to learn bladder control\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen bedwetting is resistant to home treatments or\\nwhen more serious symptoms are present, a visit should\\nbe made to a healthcare provider. This is especially war-\\nranted if the child is older than six. A thorough history and\\nphysical exam should be taken along with a urine sample.\\nAnalysis and culture tests can be done on the urine to de-\\ntermine if an infection is present. Further evaluations may\\nbe made using ultrasound, an x ray of the kidney, or a con-\\nsultation with a urologist. If the bedwetting appears to be\\nconnected with issues of stress or family problems, a men-\\ntal health consultation may be recommended.\\nTreatment\\nSitting in a cool sitz bath (pelvic area only im-\\nmersed) for about five minutes daily can tone up the ure-\\nthral sphincter. This can be done using a bathtub filled\\nwith about two or three inches of water, having the child\\nsit in a large basin of water or using a sitz basin (avail-\\nable from larger drugstores and medical supply stores).\\n“Hands-on” treatments such as acupressure, reflex-\\nology, and shiatsu can be used to relax the child, coun-\\nteract stress, and improve the actions of the nervous sys-\\ntem. Hypnotherapy can also be helpful in improving\\nbedwetting. Among other things, the child will be given\\npositive goal affirmations to say before going to bed.\\nThis should help make the urge to urinate during the\\nnight more conscious, and therefore encourage the child\\nto awaken and go to the toilet.\\nThe best way to use homeopathy is o see a home-\\nopath for individual prescribing. Equisetum 6c, may be\\nuseful, especially if there are dreams or nightmares con-\\nnected with the bedwetting. For bedwetting in very ex-\\ncitable, outgoing children, which occurs soon after\\nfalling asleep,Causticum 6c may be recommended. The\\nremedies should be given once per day at bedtime for up\\nto two weeks. A practitioner should be consulted for\\nmore specific remedies.\\nHerbal medicine\\nA strong tea can also be made using equal parts of\\nhorsetail, Equisetum arvense; St. John’s wort; cornsilk,\\nZea mays; and lemon balm , Melissa offinalis. Two to\\nthree handfuls of the mixture should be placed in a quart\\nor liter jar and then covered with boiling water. The tea\\nshould be allowed to steep overnight. The child should be\\ngiven half a cup of the tea three times per day, with the\\nlast dose being given at least two hours before bedtime.\\nNettles, Urtica dioica, can be made into a pleasant\\ntea and consumed throughout the day as a tonic for the\\nkidneys. The tea can be mixed with equal parts of fruit\\njuice as a pleasant drink for the child.\\nAromatherapy uses the essential oil of cypress, Cu-\\npressus sempervirens to treat chronic bedwetting. Sever-\\nal drops of cypress oil should be put in olive oil for mas-\\nsage. The oil should be rubbed onto the child’s stomach\\nright before bedtime.\\nBehavior modification programs may be suggested.\\nIn one type, alarms that are triggered by body moisture\\nare worn overnight, waking the child at the first sign of\\nbedwetting. The child can then go use the toilet to finish\\nemptying the bladder. This will eventually train the child\\nto awaken and use the toilet upon experiencing the sen-\\nsation of a full bladder. Nighttime toilet training using\\nthe alarm may take up to four or five months to be effec-\\ntive, however. Another program uses the child’s help\\nwith urinating before going to bed, recording wet and\\ndry nights, changing wet clothing and bedding, and dis-\\ncussing progress. Positive reinforcements, such as gold\\nstars on a chart and other rewards, are given for nights\\nthat the child does not urinate in bed.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nIf other treatments fail to work, treatment with medica-\\ntion may be suggested.

None of these\\nclaims have been substantiated by scientific studies.\\nBee pollen is said to strengthen the immune system\\nthrough its antioxidant properties. Antioxidants are used\\nto deactivate free radicals in the body. Free radicals are\\nbyproducts of oxygen that can damage cells and are\\nlinked to many degenerative diseases, especially those\\nassociated with aging. They are also associated with the\\naging process itself. Antioxidants may block further\\ndamage and even reverse much of the cell oxidation al-\\nready done. Bee pollen is suggested to help counteract\\nthe effects of radiation and environmental pollutants that\\nweaken the immune system, supporters say.\\nIn the January 2000 issue of Bee Online, an Internet\\npublication of the American Apitherapy Society, Steve\\nSchecter, naturopathic doctor, said bee pollen is benefi-\\ncial in reducing the effects of radiation treatment in\\nwomen with cancer. A group of 25 women undergoing\\ntreatment for uterine cancer also took 20 g (about two\\nteaspoons) of bee pollen three times a day. The women\\nreported improvements in their appetites and sense of\\nwell being, and less severe nausea associated with radia-\\ntion therapy. Their serum protein levels increased and\\nred and white blood cell counts also improved.\\nAlthough many plant pollens can cause or exacer-\\nbate allergies and hay fever , bee pollen can actually\\nhelp reduce the symptoms of these conditions. Local bee\\npollen therapy is recommended to start before the allergy\\nseason begins and it may take a few weeks for the pollen\\nto work. According to an article in the February 1998\\nissue of Better Nutrition, an Oklahoma allergist success-\\nfully used bee pollen to treat 22,000 patients with aller-\\ngies. However, those allergic to bee stings may experi-\\nence severe (anaphylactic) reactions to the pollen.\\nBee pollen is often used by athletes to improve\\nstrength, endurance, energy, and speed. It is said to help\\nmuscles recover more quickly from exercise and to in-\\ncrease mental stamina. “Bee pollen is used by almost\\nevery Olympic athlete in the world,” said James Higgins,\\ntreasurer of the American Apitherapy Society, in an inter-\\nview in the August 1999 issue of Better Nutrition . “It\\ngives them more energy and better performance for events\\nlike marathons, and they aren’t as exhausted the next day.”\\nPreparations\\nIt takes about two hours for bee pollen to be absorbed\\ninto the bloodstream. It is available in health food stores in\\ngelatin capsules, tablets, and granules. Capsules and tablets\\ngenerally contain 500-1000 mg of bee pollen. A 100-count\\nbottle costs $5-8 on average. Granules are sold by the\\nounce or pound. A one-pound bag costs about $20. The\\nrecommended dosages for preventative purposes are an\\neighth to a quarter teaspoon of granules once a day to start,\\ngradually increasing over a month to one to two teaspoons,\\none to three times a day. The dosage for short-term thera-\\npeutic use is 3/8-3/4 teaspoon to start, increasing to three to\\nsix teaspoons, one to three times a day. The recommended\\npreventative dosage for capsules is two 450-580 mg cap-\\nsules, three to four times a day, and three times that dosage\\nfor therapeutic purposes. Bee pollen is also available in liq-\\nuid, cream, salve, and tincture form, mainly for use on skin\\nconditions, sores, pounds, and bruises. Bee pollen should\\nnot be heated, since it will lose its potency.\\nPrecautions\\nPersons who are allergic to bee stings or products\\nshould not use bee pollen since it may cause a serious aller-\\ngic reaction, including death. Anyone uncertain if they are\\nallergic to bee pollen should sample only a few granules\\nfirst to see if there is any type of reaction, or have an allergy\\ntest. Those using bee pollen to reduce hay fever should be\\nsure to consume local bee pollen to obtain the best results.\\nSide effects\\nThere are rare cases of minor side effects, such as\\ngastrointestinal irritation and diarrhea, associated with\\ningesting bee pollen.\\nInteractions\\nBee pollen has no known negative interactions with\\nother drugs, vitamins, or supplements.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBalch, James F.

Rather than simply pre-\\nscribe lenses to compensate for eyesight weaknesses, be-\\nhavioral optometrists attempt to train the patient to see\\nbetter across a range of different circumstances.\\nOrigins\\nBehavioral optometry traces its roots to the writings\\nof Dr. William H. Bates, a New York City ophthalmolo-\\ngist. Bates began writing in the 1920s about alternatives\\nto the use of corrective lenses. He believed that many\\nphysical and emotional stresses caused vision problems,\\nand that alleviating these stresses could improve vision.\\nHe noted that modern humans spend an inordinate\\namount of time doing close work such as reading, while\\nthe human eye may have been originally adapted for dis-\\ntance vision. Bates devised a program of eye training\\nthat allowed patients to gradually improve their vision\\nwithout glasses. The English novelist Aldous Huxley re-\\ncovered from near-blindness using Bates’s system, and\\nwrote a book about his experience. Other optometrists\\nbuilt on Bates’s insights, supplementing his research and\\nideas. Some researchers focused on the fact that the need\\nfor corrective lenses rises in proportion to a person’s\\nlevel of education. They concluded that the stress of\\nreading was probably responsible for poor eyesight. Oth-\\ners noted that vision problems increase as cultures be-\\ncome increasingly industrialized and developed. Practi-\\ntioners of behavioral optometry who built on and extend-\\ned Bates’s ideas include Dr. Raymond L. Gottlieb and\\nDr. Jacob Liberman, both influential authors and teach-\\ners. Behavioral optometrists are distinctly a minority in\\nthe field of optometry, but they can be found across the\\nUnited States and worldwide.\\nBenefits\\nBehavioral optometrists promise many benefits\\nfrom this way of treating vision problems.

In addition, behavioral optometry\\nhas been used to develop the special visual acuity that is\\nneeded for sports; and some practitioners are trained to\\ntreat patients who have suffered vision trauma such as\\nstroke, or to work with autistic or disabled children.\\nDescription\\nBehavioral optometry aims to treat the whole patient,\\nnot just correct his or her vision. The first step in an ex-\\namination may be a wide-ranging series of tests and ques-\\ntions, geared to determine the patient’s overall visual\\nabilities. This term means not just how well the eyes read\\nletters on a chart, but such broader areas of visual percep-\\ntion as hand-eye coordination and color perception. Be-\\nhavioral optometrists will prescribe corrective lenses, but\\nthese are usually somewhat different from traditional\\nglasses. The lenses are designed to relieve the stress\\ncaused by such close-focus work as reading or working at\\na computer. But for distance seeing, the lenses may not\\nbe as accurate as traditional lenses, since the behavioral\\noptometrist seeks to teach the eyes to relearn distance vi-\\nsion skills that have atrophied. Many behavioral op-\\ntometrists prescribe lenses that include a series of small\\nprisms, which are supposed to help the eyes develop bet-\\nter vision patterns. Behavioral optometrists also practice\\nvision therapy, in which the optometrist works closely\\nwith the patient in step-by-step exercises to help the eyes\\nrelax and relearn lost skills. These are not merely eye ex-\\nercises, because exercising the muscles around the eye\\ncan fatigue them instead of strengthen them. The therapy\\nmight involve learning new skills such as juggling, draw-\\ning, dancing, or ball games, as well as relaxation tech-\\nniques. The optometrist may also work with the patient to\\nalter diet, sleep patterns, and lifestyle stress.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThough behavioral optometrists are definitely a mi-\\nnority within the field of optometry, a body of research\\nsupports their methods. This can be found in profession-\\nal journals such as Journal of Behavioral Optometry and\\nJournal of Optometric Vision Development . Bates’s\\nmethod has been in use since the 1920s, and much anec-\\ndotal evidence attests to its efficacy, including the dra-\\nmatic case of writer Aldous Huxley. Other patients and\\npractitioners have written of their ability to function\\nwithout glasses and overcome learning disabilities\\nthrough behavioral optometry. And one of the major con-\\ntentions of behavioral optometry is that conventional op-\\ntometry does not cure the eye conditions it treats. My-\\nopic patients are given glasses, and then a stronger pair\\nof glasses, and then a stronger, as vision gradually wors-\\nens. Behavioral optometrists use this development as ev-\\nidence that conventional optometry fails its patients.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 197\\nBehavioral therapy\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nOphthalmologist—A physician who specializes in\\ntreating diseases and disorders of the eye.\\nOptometrist —A professional who examines the\\neyes for vision defects in order to fit the patient\\nwith corrective lenses or prescribe other appropri-\\nate treatment.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 197'),\n",

Modern behavioral therapy began in the 1950s with\\nthe work of B.F. Skinner and Joseph Wolpe. Wolpe treat-\\ned his patients who suffered from phobias with a tech-\\nnique he developed called systematic desensitization.\\nSystematic desensitization involved gradually exposing a\\npatient to an anxiety-provoking stimuli until the anxiety\\nresponse was extinguished, or eliminated.\\nSkinner introduced a behavioral technique he called\\noperant conditioning. Operant conditioning is based on\\nthe idea that an individual will choose his behavior based\\non past experiences of consequences of that behavior. If\\na behavior was associated with positive reinforcements\\nor rewards in the past, the individual will choose it over\\nbehavior associated with punishments.\\nBy the 1970s, behavior therapy enjoyed widespread\\npopularity as a treatment approach. Over the past two\\ndecades, the attention of behavioral therapists has fo-\\ncused increasingly on their clients’ cognitive processes,\\nand many therapists have begun to use cognitive behav-\\nior therapy to change clients’ unhealthy behavior by re-\\nplacing negative or self-defeating thought patterns with\\nmore positive ones.\\nBenefits\\nBehavioral therapy can be a useful treatment tool in\\nan array of mental illnesses and symptoms of mental ill-\\nness that involve maladaptive behavior, such as sub-\\nstance abuse, aggressive behavior, anger management,\\neating disorders, phobias, and anxiety disorders. It is\\nalso used to treat organic disorders such as incontinence\\nand insomnia by changing the behaviors that might be\\ncontributing to these disorders.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy, an offshoot of behav-\\nioral therapy that focuses on changing maladaptive be-\\nhaviors by changing the faulty thinking patterns behind\\nthem, is a recommended treatment option for a number\\nof mental disorders, including affective (mood) disor-\\nders, personality disorders, social phobia,\\nschizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),\\nagoraphobia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\\nAlzheimer’s disease, and attention-deficit hyperactivi-\\nty disorder (ADHD). It is also frequently used as a tool\\nto deal with chronic pain for patients with illnesses such\\nas rheumatoid arthritis, back problems, and cancer.\\nBehavioral therapy techniques are sometimes com-\\nbined with other psychological interventions such as med-\\nication. Treatment depends on the individual patient and the\\nseverity of symptoms surrounding the behavioral problem.\\nDescription\\nBehavioral therapy, or behavior modification, is\\nbased on the assumption that emotional problems, like\\nany behavior, are learned responses to the environment\\nand can be unlearned. Unlike psychodynamic therapies,\\nit does not focus on uncovering or understanding the un-\\nconscious motivations that may be behind the maladap-\\ntive behavior. In other words, behavioral therapists don’t\\ntry to find out why their patients behave the way they do,\\nthey just teach them to change the behavior.\\nInitial treatment sessions are typically spent explain-\\ning the basic tenets of behavioral therapy to the patient\\nand establishing a positive working relationship between\\ntherapist and patient. Behavioral therapy is a collabora-\\ntive, action-oriented therapy, and as such, it empowers\\npatients by giving them an active role in the treatment\\nprocess. It also discourages overdependence on the ther-\\napist, a situation that may occur in other therapeutic rela-\\ntionships. Treatment is typically administered in an out-\\npatient setting in either a group or individual session.\\nTreatment is relatively short compared to other forms of\\npsychotherapy, usually lasting no longer than 16 weeks\\nor sessions.\\nThere are a number of different techniques used in\\nbehavioral therapy to help patients change their behav-\\niors. These include:\\n• Behavioral homework assignments. The therapist often\\nrequests that the patient complete homework assign-\\nments between therapy sessions. These may consist of\\nreal-life behavioral experiments where patients are en-\\ncouraged to try new responses to situations discussed in\\ntherapy sessions.\\n• Contingency contracting. In conjunction with the pa-\\ntient, the therapist outlines a written or verbal contract of\\ndesired behaviors for the patient. The contract may have\\ncertain positive reinforcements (rewards) associated with\\nappropriate behaviors and negative reinforcements (pun-\\nishments) associated with maladaptive behavior.\\n• Modeling. This is where the patient learns a new be-\\nhavior through observation.\\n• Rehearsed behavior. The therapist and patient engage\\nin role-playing exercises in which the therapist acts out\\nappropriate behaviors or responses to situations.\\n• Skills training techniques. The patient undergoes an ed-\\nucation program to learn social, parenting, or other rel-\\nevant life skills.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2198\\nBehavioral therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 198'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 215}, page_content='• Conditioning. The therapist uses reinforcement to en-\\ncourage a particular behavior. For example, a child\\nwith ADHD may get a gold star every time he stays fo-\\ncused on tasks and accomplishes certain daily chores.\\nThe gold star reinforces and increases the desired be-\\nhavior by identifying it with something positive. Rein-\\nforcement can also be used to extinguish unwanted be-\\nhaviors by imposing negative consequences (this is also\\ncalled punishment and response).\\n• Systematic desensitization. Patients are gradually ex-\\nposed to a situation they fear, either in a role-playing\\nsituation or in reality. The therapist will employ relax-\\nation techniques to help them cope with their fear reac-\\ntion and eventually eliminate the anxiety altogether.\\nFor example, a patient in treatment for agoraphobia, a\\nfear of open or public places, will relax and then pic-\\nture herself on the sidewalk outside of her house. In her\\nnext session, she may relax herself and then imagine a\\nvisit to a crowded shopping mall. The imagery gets\\nprogressively more intense until eventually, the thera-\\npist and patient approach the anxiety-producing situa-\\ntion in real life by visiting a mall. By repeatedly pairing\\na desired response (relaxation) with a fear-producing\\nsituation (open, public spaces), the patient gradually\\nbecomes desensitized to the old response of fear and\\nlearns to react with feelings of relaxation.\\n• Flooding. Flooding is an accelerated version of system-\\natic desensitization, in which the patient is exposed di-\\nrectly to the anxiety-provoking situation that he fears\\nmost (either through mental visualization or real life\\ncontact) in an effort to extinguish the fear response.\\n• Progressive relaxation. As the name implies, progres-\\nsive relaxation involves complete relaxation of the\\nmuscle groups of the body and calm and even breathing\\nuntil the body is completely tension free. It is used by\\nbehavioral therapists both as a relaxation exercise to re-\\nlieve anxiety and stress, and as a method of preparing\\nthe patient for systematic desensitization. Progressive\\nrelaxation is performed by first tensing and then relax-\\ning the muscles of the body, one group at a time. The\\ntherapist may suggest that the patient use one of many\\navailable instructional relaxation tapes for practicing\\nthis technique at home.\\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) integrates fea-\\ntures of behavioral modification into the traditional cog-\\nnitive restructuring approach. In cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapy, the therapist works with the patient to identify\\nthe thoughts that are causing distress, and employs be-\\nhavioral therapy techniques to alter the resulting behav-\\nior. Patients may have certain fundamental core beliefs,\\nknown as schemas, which are flawed and are having a\\nnegative impact on the patient’s behavior and function-\\ning. For example, a patient suffering from depression\\nmay develop a social phobia because he is convinced he\\nis uninteresting and unlikable. A cognitive-behavioral\\ntherapist would test this assumption, or schema, by ask-\\ning the patient to name family and friends that care for\\nhim and enjoy his company. By showing the patient that\\nothers value him, the therapist exposes the irrationality\\nof the patient’s assumption. He also provides a new\\nmodel of thought for the patient to change his previous\\nbehavior pattern (i.e., I am an interesting and likeable\\nperson, therefore I should not have any problem making\\nnew social acquaintances). Additional behavioral tech-\\nniques such as conditioning (the use of positive and/or\\nnegative reinforcements to encourage desired behavior)\\nand systematic desensitization (gradual exposure to anxi-\\nety-producing situations in order to extinguish the fear\\nresponse) may then be used to gradually reintroduce the\\npatient to social situations.\\nAdditional treatment techniques that may be em-\\nployed with cognitive-behavioral therapy include:\\n• Cognitive rehearsal. The patient imagines a difficult sit-\\nuation, and the therapist guides him through the step-\\nby-step process of facing and successfully dealing with\\nit. The patient then works on practicing, or rehearsing,\\nthese steps mentally. Ideally, when the situation arises\\nin real life, the patient will draw on the rehearsed be-\\nhavior to address it.\\n• Journal therapy. Patients are asked to keep a detailed\\ndiary recounting their thoughts, feelings, and actions\\nwhen specific situations arise. The journal helps to\\nmake the patient aware of his or her maladaptive\\nthoughts and to show their consequences on behavior.\\nIn later stages of therapy, it may serve to demonstrate\\nand reinforce positive behavior.\\n• Validity testing. Patients are asked to test the validity of\\nthe automatic thoughts and schemas they encounter.\\nThe therapist may ask the patient to defend or produce\\nevidence that a schema is true. If the patient is unable\\nto meet the challenge, the faulty nature of that schema\\nis exposed.\\nBiofeedback is a patient-guided treatment that is\\nalso associated with behavioral therapy. Biofeedback\\nteaches an individual to control muscle tension, pain,\\nbody temperature, brain waves, and other bodily func-\\ntions and processes through relaxation, visualization,\\nand other techniques. In some cases, positive reinforce-\\nments are used to reward patients who generate the cor-\\nrect biofeedback response during treatment. The name\\nbiofeedback refers to the biological signals that are fed\\nback to the patient in order for the patient to develop\\ntechniques of controlling them.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 199\\nBehavioral therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 199'),\n",

Reproduced by\\npermission.)\\nBelladonna\\nDescription\\nBelladonna, more commonly known as deadly night-\\nshade, Atropa belladonna , devil’s cherries, devil’s herb,\\ndivale, dwale, dwayberry, great morel, naughty man’s\\ncherries, and poison black cherry, is a perennial herb that\\nhas been valued for its medicinal properties for over five\\ncenturies. Belladonna is a member of the Solanaceae\\n(nightshade) family, and can be identified by its bell-\\nshaped, purple flowers and cherry-sized green berries that\\nmature to a dark purple or black color. The tall, branching\\nplant can grow to a height of at least 5 ft (1.5 m), and is\\nnative to Europe, North Africa, and Asia and cultivated in\\nNorth America and the United Kingdom. Belladonna has\\nalso been introduced to a number of places, including the\\nUnited States and Ireland and now grows wild.\\nBelladonna leaves are large (up to 10 in [25.4 cm] in\\nlength) and grow in pairs on either side of the plant stem.\\nNear the flowers or blossoms, one of each leaf pair is no-\\nticeably smaller in size. Both the leaves and root have a\\nsharp, unpleasant odor and bitter taste. As the name\\ndeadly nightshade suggests, the herb is highly toxic if\\ntaken even when taken in extremely low concentrations.\\nOne of the first widespread uses of the herb was\\npurely a cosmetic one. Sixteenth century Italian women\\nreportedly applied belladonna solutions to their eyes to\\ndilate the pupils and achieve a dreamy and supposedly\\nmore desirable appearance (hence the name belladonna,\\nwhich is Italian for ‘beautiful lady’). Atropine, an alka-\\nloid of belladonna that blocks certain nerve impulses, is\\nstill used by some opthamologists today to dilate the\\npupils for eye exams.\\nGeneral use\\nBelladonna has a long history of medicinal applica-\\ntions in healthcare. Belladonna alkaloids are anticholin-\\nergic, which means that it works by blocking the certain\\nnerve impulses involved in the parasympathetic nervous\\nsystem, which regulates certain involuntary bodily func-\\ntions or reflexes, including pupil dilation, heart rate, se-\\ncretion of glands and organs, and the constriction of the\\nbronchioles in the lungs and the alimentary canal (diges-\\ntive tract). Belladonna relaxes the smooth muscles of the\\ninternal organs and inhibits or dries up secretions (e.g.,\\nperspiration, mucous, breast milk, and saliva).\\nBelladonna alkaloids, the active ingredients of the\\nplant, include atropine and scopolamine. These alkaloids\\nare extracted from the leaves and root of the plant and\\nadministered either alone or in combination with other\\nherbal remedies or prescription medications. However\\neven tiny doses are toxic and should only be taken by\\nprescription.\\nBelladonna alkaloids are used to treat a variety of\\nsymptoms and conditions, including:\\n• Gastrointestinal disorders. Because the alkaloids relax\\nthe smooth muscles of the gastrointestinal tract and re-\\nduces stomach acid secretions, it is useful in treating\\ncolitis,diverticulitis, irritable bowel syndrome, colic,\\ndiarrhea, and peptic ulcer.\\n• Asthma. By relaxing the bronchioles, belladonna alle-\\nviates the wheezing symptoms of an asthma attack.\\n• Excessive sweating. Belladonna slows gland and organ\\nsecretion, which makes it useful in controlling condi-\\ntions that cause excessive sweating.\\n• Nighttime incontinence. Belladonna acts as a diuretic,\\nand can be helpful in treating excessive nighttime uri-\\nnation and incontinence.\\n• Headaches and migraines. The pain-relieving proper-\\nties of atropine, a belladonna alkaloid, are useful in\\ntreating headaches.\\n• Muscle pains and spasms. Belladonna is frequently\\nprescribed to ease severe menstrual cramps.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 201'),\n",

Scopolamine, an alkaloid of bel-\\nladonna, is helpful in treating motion sickness and ver-\\ntigo.\\n• Parkinson’s disease. Belladonna can alleviate the exces-\\nsive sweating and salivation associated with the disease,\\nas well as controlling tremors and muscle rigidity.\\n• Biliary colic. Muscle spasm, or colic, of the gallbladder\\nand liver can be relieved through the muscle relaxing\\nproperties of belladonna.\\nHomeopathic use\\nBelladonna is frequently prescribed homeopathic\\nremedy used to treat illnesses that manifest symptoms\\nsimilar to those that belladonna poisoning triggers (i.e.,\\nhigh fever, nausea, delirium, muscle spasms, flushed\\nskin, dilated pupils). These include the common cold ,\\notitis media (earache), fever, arthritis, menstrual cramps,\\ndiverticulitis, muscle pain, sunstroke, toothache and\\nteething, conjunctivitis , headaches, sore throat , and\\nboils and abscesses. As with all homeopathic remedies,\\nthe prescription of belladonna depends on the individ-\\nual’s overall symptom picture, mood, and temperament.\\nWhen used as a homeopathic remedy, belladonna is ad-\\nministered in a highly diluted form to trigger the body’s\\nnatural healing response without risk of belladonna poi-\\nsoning or death.\\nResults of a clinical trial performed at the National\\nCancer Institute of Milan, Italy, have also indicated that\\nhomeopathic remedies of belladonna can be useful in re-\\nlieving the discomfort, warmth, and swelling of the skin\\nassociated with radiotherapy for breast cancer (i.e., ra-\\ndiodermatitis).\\nPreparations\\nBelladonna leaf is harvested between May and July\\nand dried at temperatures no warmer than 140°F (60° C).\\nThe roots of Atropa belladonna plants that have reached\\ntwo to four year old maturity are also harvested for\\nherbal preparations in early fall between mid-October\\nand mid-November. The roots are then cleaned and dried\\nat temperatures no warmer than 122°F (50°C). After dry-\\ning, the leaves and roots are crushed for use in a number\\nof forms, including decoctions, tinctures, infusions, plas-\\nters, pills, suppositories, liquid solutions or suspensions,\\nand powders. They can be used both alone and in combi-\\nnation with other herbs and medications.\\nIt is extremely dangerous to self-prescribe bel-\\nladonna, and it should always be taken under the di-\\nrection of a doctor or other qualified healthcare pro-\\nfessional. The frequency and quantity of dosage will\\ndepend on both the patient and the illness the herb is\\nprescribed for, but the doses are always extremely\\nsmall. For example the Physicians Desk Reference\\n(PDR) for Herbal Medicines recommends an average\\nsingle dose of 0.05-0.10 g. Each patient’s illness is\\ndifferent and some patients experience toxicity at un-\\nusually low doses.\\nFor homeopathic remedies, the plant is broken apart\\nand juice is extracted through a pressing process. The ex-\\ntract is then mixed with a water/alcohol solution by a\\nratio of either 1:10 or 1:100, and this process is repeated\\nup to 30 times to form an extremely diluted dose of the\\nextract. Homeopathic belladonna remedy is generally\\nadded to pellets of sugar for easier administration. The\\ndilution and dosage frequency depend on the symptoms\\nbeing treated, but homeopathic remedies are typically\\nadministered only until the patient starts to show signs of\\nimprovement so that the body’s natural healing response\\ncan take over.\\nBelladonna is available by prescription both alone\\n(in high concentration strength) and in combination\\nwith other drugs. Currently available prescription\\ncombinations include belladonna with opium (for\\nuterine pain), kaolin and pectin (for diarrhea), pheno-\\nbarbital (for menopausal symptoms and migraine pro-\\nphylactic), other barbiturates (for insomnia and for\\ncramping and muscle spasms in the digestive tract), or\\nbelladonna and opium suppositories (for severe in-\\ntestinal cramping).\\nBelladonna preparations should be stored in air-tight\\ncontainers away from direct light. Under these condi-\\ntions, most preparations will remain potent for up to\\nthree years.\\nPrecautions\\nIngestion of high concentrations of atropine, a po-\\ntent alkaloid found in belladonna, can cause severe ill-\\nness and death. Atropine is fatal in doses as small as 100\\nmg, which equals 5-50 g of belladonna herb, depending\\non the potency of the particular plant. For children, a\\nfatal dose is even significantly less. For this reason, bel-\\nladonna should never be used unless prescribed by a\\ntrained practitioner.\\nIndividuals suffering from kidney disease, intestinal\\nblockage, glaucoma , enlarged prostate, urinary block-\\nage, severe ulcerative colitis, or myasthenia gravis are\\nadvised not to take belladonna, as are those patients with\\na known allergy to belladonna. Patients with any chronic\\nhealth conditions should never take belladonna without a\\ndoctor’s prescription.\\nPregnant or breastfeeding women should avoid all but\\nhomeopathic belladonna, unless prescribed by a doctor.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2202\\nBelladonna\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 202'),\n",

It is a fat-soluble pigment found\\nin plants (notably carrots and many colorful vegetables\\nand fruits) and in the sea alga Dunaleilla salina and D.\\nbardawil. Naturalbeta carotene supplements are derived\\nprimarily from D. salina . Beta carotene is one of the\\nmajor dietary carotenoids and one of the most biological-\\nly active of approximately 800 carotenes and more than\\n1,000 carotenoids present in food. It is responsible for the\\norange or yellow colors of many fruits and vegetables. In\\nthe human body, beta carotene is found in lipids and in fat\\ntissues. Sometimes beta carotene is called provitamin A\\nbecause it is more easily converted to vitamin A (retinol)\\nin the liver than other carotenoids. Beta carotene is consid-\\nered to be a conditionally essential nutrient because it be-\\ncomes essential when vitamin A intake is low.\\nBeta carotene consists of a chain of 40 carbon\\natoms, with conjugated double bonds and a ring struc-\\nture at each end of the chain. Depending on the positions\\nof the molecular groups attached to the carbon chain,\\nnaturally occurring beta carotene may be:\\n• All-trans beta-carotene\\n• 9-cis beta-carotene\\n• 13-cis beta-carotene, in smaller amounts\\nSynthetic beta carotene is primarily all-trans.\\nIn plants and alga, beta carotene and other caroten-\\noids attract light for photosynthesis and provide protec-\\ntion from toxic forms of oxygen. Beta carotene is a pow-\\nerful antioxidant because it destroys toxic free radicals,\\nincluding singlet oxygen—an oxygen atom that is miss-\\ning an electron and is very damaging to human tissue if\\nnot taken up quickly and “deactivated.”\\nGeneral use\\nVitamin A precursor\\nVitamin A is obtained in the diet from animal prod-\\nucts or is made in the liver from beta carotene and other\\ncarotenoids. Vitamin A is essential for:\\n• vision and eye health\\n• normal cell division\\n• growth\\n• reproduction and fertility\\n• immune system function\\n• skin and mucous membrane health\\nIn sub-Saharan Africa about three million children\\nunder the age of five suffer from an eye disorder, caused\\nby vitamin-A deficiency, that can lead to blindness and\\ndeath. Although red palm oil, a traditional African food,\\ncontains high provitamin A, its substitution by imported\\ncooking oils has reduced this dietary source in many\\nhomes. Many vegetables and fruits also contain provita-\\nmin A, but are not always consumed in adequate\\namounts. Vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of\\nblindness worldwide.\\nIn the 1920s vitamin-A deficiency was linked to\\nstomach cancer and to precancerous conditions in the\\nepithelial (lining) cells of the throat and lungs. In 1977\\nvitamin A supplementation was shown to inhibit certain\\ncancers and to reduce the growth of certain tumors in at-\\nrisk animals.\\nDietary beta carotene\\nCarotenoids, including beta carotene, that are ob-\\ntained from food may have:\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2204\\nBeta carotene\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 204'),\n",

In 1971 a large human study linked\\ncancer death rates to low levels of beta carotene in the\\nblood. Subsequent studies linked high blood levels of di-\\netary beta carotene to lower cancer risks. However more\\nrecent evidence links these results to a combination of\\nantioxidants found in fruits and vegetables, rather then to\\nbeta carotene alone. High beta carotene levels in the\\nblood may be associated with a reduced risk of asthma.\\nSupplemental beta carotene\\nSupplemental beta carotene has been claimed to:\\n• inhibit precancerous lesions in those at risk of oral cancer\\n• protect against gastric and esophageal cancers\\n• reduce the risk of prostate cancer\\n• lower the overall cancer risk\\n• protect against sunburn\\nHowever, there is very little evidence that supple-\\nmental beta carotene is an effective cancer-preventing\\nsubstance, except perhaps in those with poor nutrition\\nor low baseline levels of beta carotene in the blood.

There are two incompat-\\nible systems for quantifying beta carotene. IUs are used\\nmost often for nutritional labeling:\\n• 1 IU equals 0.6 µg of all-trans beta carotene\\n• 3.33 IU of all-trans beta carotene, 2 µg, is equal to 1 µg\\nof all-trans retinol (vitamin A)\\n• 5,000 IU equals 3 mg of beta carotene, the RDA for vi-\\ntamin A\\n• 1 IU equals 1.2 µg of other provitamin A carotenoids\\nThe second system uses retinol equivalents (RE):\\n• 1 RE equals 1 µg of all-trans retinol\\n• 1 RE equals 6 µg of all-trans beta carotene\\n• 1 RE equals 12 µg of other provitamin A carotenoids\\nDietary beta carotene\\nDaily values (DVs) are determined from the RDA.\\nThey are based on a 2,000-calorie diet and usually are\\nexpressed as a percentage of an RDA. The IUs and DVs\\nfor beta carotene, per serving, in common foods are list-\\ned in table 1.\\nCarrots and sweet potatoes that are more orange\\ncontain more beta carotene. New carrot cultivars that\\ncontain more beta carotene have been developed and\\nhigh-beta-carotene sweet potatoes are being introduced\\ninto sub-Saharan Africa to treat vitamin-A deficiency.\\nOther foods that contain beta carotene include:\\n• avocados\\n• broccoli\\n• chard\\n• coffee\\n• collard greens\\n• palm oil and other food colorants\\n• squash\\n• string beans\\n• watermelon\\n• yams\\nAccording to the Institute of Medicine, a daily in-\\ntake of 3–6 mg of beta carotene will keep the blood level\\nwithin the range associated with a lower risk for chronic\\ndiseases. The recommended daily diet of five or more\\nservings of fruits and vegetables provides 3–6 mg of beta\\ncarotene (if carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, apricots or\\nother very high carotenoid food is used, the RDA can be\\nmet in a single serving). In contrast, the average Ameri-\\ncan diet contains 1.3–2.9 mg daily. Vegetarians may have\\ntwice as much beta carotene in their blood as compared\\nto non-vegetarians, because they generally consume a lot\\nmore greens and fruits.\\nBeta carotene in food is found within an oil or a ma-\\ntrix of sugars and proteins; and, therefore, the absorption of\\nbeta carotene by the body varies greatly. The elderly, and\\nthose with bad digestion and liver trouble may be at risk\\nfor poor absorption from an adequate beta carotene diet.\\nAnimal sources of vitamin A are more easily ab-\\nsorbed than plant sources of beta carotene, particularly if\\nthe vegetables and fruits are eaten raw or whole. Al-\\nthough beta carotene can be converted to vitamin A in\\nthe body, it has its own unique physiological functions\\nand beta carotene and vitamin A are not totally identical\\nin the health benefits they deliver. So it is good to eat\\nsources of both. While supplementation is helpful to\\nthose who have trouble absorbing adequate beta\\ncarotene, getting all or some beta carotene through food\\nsources rather than supplements alone is by far the best.\\nThis is substantiated by research showing there are many\\nbeneficial carotenoids in foods, and that they may also\\nwork together synergistically to optimize health.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2206\\nBeta carotene\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 206'),\n",

Exfoliation\\nleaves behind fresh skin that is also smoother and softer\\nthan before. Beta hydroxys work by speeding up the\\nturnover of skin cells. They dissolve the glue that holds\\ndead skin cells in the top layers, allowing the fresh cells\\nbeneath to emerge. Chemical exfoliation with beta hy-\\ndroxys peels away a variety of such age-related skin\\nproblems as wrinkles, acne, age spots, blemishes, and\\nskin unevenness.

They\\nare also found naturally in fresh fruit (berries, pineapple,\\npapaya, etc.), milk and yogurt,wintergreen leaves,\\nsweet birch, and some other plants.\\nStructurally, BHAs appear to be very similar to an-\\nother group of chemicals used in skin care products, the\\nalpha hydroxy acids or AHAs. These two groups of\\nchemicals have similar activities as well; both are skin\\nexfoliants. BHAs, however, are believed to be less irritat-\\ning to the skin than AHAs. They are also more effective\\nin preventing acne eruptions and smoothing the skin.\\nGeneral use\\nSkin cleansing\\nMany skin cleansers today contain BHAs. BHAs are\\neffective because they help remove excess oil from the\\nface. They can, however, remove oil only on the surface\\nand cannot affect oil production under the skin. To help\\nmaintain healthy skin, these cleansers should be used once\\nor twice a week to improve skin tone and texture. BHA-\\ncontaining preparations should be left on the face for a\\nshort time only and rinsed off with generous amounts of\\nwater. Because the skin is more sensitive to sunlight after\\nthe use of products containing BHAs, users should apply\\nsunscreens and avoid prolonged sun exposure.\\nWrinkles and age spots\\nWrinkles are signs of the normal aging process.\\nOver the years, the skin becomes thinner, drier and less\\nelastic as its collagen and elastin fibers gradually lose\\ntheir elasticity. To improve the appearance of the skin\\nand to correct minor blemishes and uneveness, some\\npeople have chemical peels with hydroxy acids. Chemi-\\ncal peels have become one of the most popular methods\\nfor removing wrinkles. This process uses concentrated\\npreparations of BHAs, AHAs, or combinations of both to\\nremove the top layer of skin. The chemical peel allows a\\nnewer layer of skin to replace the older layer. Some fine\\nlines and wrinkles may also be removed.\\nBecause of potential scarring and other severe ad-\\nverse reactions, chemical peels are done by a profession-\\nal, usually a board-certified dermatologist or a licensed\\nestheticist (skin care specialist).\\nFor best results, chemical peels are often used in combi-\\nnation with such other anti-wrinkle treatments as collagen or\\nfat implants or laser surgery. For relatively young people, a\\nchemical peel with BHA often provides satisfactory results.\\nThose over 40 sometimes choose to have collagen or fat im-\\nplants together with the peel. Some older patients may have\\nboth a chemical peel and a special kind of laser surgery\\ncalled laser resurfacing. While chemical peels can remove\\nsome fine wrinkle lines, laser resurfacing is a more powerful\\ntool. It can remove deeper wrinkles and skin imperfections.\\nAcne therapy\\nAcne is a skin disorder caused by excessive produc-\\ntion of oil under the uppermost layers of skin. When the\\noil cannot pass through the hair follicles, the pores under\\nthe skin are plugged up, trapping the oil and dead skin\\ncells underneath the skin. These plugged pores become\\nfertile breeding grounds for a type of bacterium called\\nPropionibacterium acnes, sometimes called the acne\\nbacillus, to grow inside the pore, causing irritation, in-\\nflammation, and in due time, pimples.\\nBecause it is an effective cleanser, a 1% solution of\\nsalicylic acid, which is a BHA, can enter the pores and\\nhelp to remove excess oil, dirt, and dead skin cells. It re-\\nduces skin breakouts by preventing the buildup of dead\\nskin cells associated with acne formation. Beta hydroxy\\nacids, including salicylic acid, are good treatments for\\nacne because they are relatively mild. Because they are\\napplied topically, they do not cause systemic side effects\\nas oral antibiotics sometimes do. In addition, they are es-\\npecially appropriate for the treatment of acne because\\nthey have anti-inflammatory properties. BHAs, however,\\ndo not have the antimicrobial properties of such topical\\nmedications as benzyl peroxide.\\nPsoriasis\\nPsoriasis is a chronic skin condition requiring life-\\nlong treatment with topical lotions and creams, pho-\\ntotherapy (using radiation or ultraviolet light), or med-\\nications taken by mouth. Salicylic acid can be used to\\ntreat psoriasis. Salicylic acid facilitates the removal of\\nscaly skin. In so doing, it helps moisturizers and other\\ntopical medications for psoriasis work more effectively.\\nWarts\\nSalicylic acid is also an effective and mild treatment\\nfor warts and plantar warts. Patients should wash and dry\\nthe area around the wart thoroughly before applying the\\nproduct. Then they should apply a thin film of salicylic acid\\nover each wart and allow it to dry. The product should be\\napplied once or twice a day. Salicylic acid acts slowly and\\nmay take as long as 12 weeks before one can see results.\\nOther uses\\nThe anti-inflammatory properties of BHAs are use-\\nful in treating such other skin conditions as dandruff or\\nseborrheic dermatitis.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 209\\nBeta hydroxy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 209'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 226}, page_content='Preparations\\nSalicylic acid is often found in many over-the-\\ncounter skin care products such as soaps, cleansers, acne\\nmedications, and anti-wrinkle creams. These products,\\nhowever, contain only 2% of salicylic acid. This concen-\\ntration is strong enough for exfoliation but not for chem-\\nical peel treatment.\\nChemical peel preparations contain very high con-\\ncentrations (up to 30%) of beta hydroxy acids in combi-\\nnation with alpha hydroxy acids. Because of the poten-\\ntial for scarring and other severe adverse reactions, these\\nprescription-strength products are not sold to the general\\npublic. They are available only to licensed dermatolo-\\ngists or estheticians.\\nBHAs can also be found in certain fruits and vegeta-\\nbles. For example, thin layers of papaya can be applied\\non the face and allowed to remain for a while. Papaya\\npulp helps soften the skin and decrease its unevenness. It\\nis most beneficial to dry, sun-damaged skin, although it\\nmay also cause allergic reactions in some sensitive peo-\\nple. Pineapple is another natural product that contains\\nbeta hydroxy acid. Pineapple can be put into a blender or\\njuicer to obtain fresh juice. The juice can be applied to\\nthe skin; again, however, it may cause allergic reactions.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople who use skin care products containing BHAs\\nshould be aware of the following considerations and side\\neffects:\\n• Increased sensitivity to sunlight. Exfoliated skin is very\\ntender and sensitive to sunlight. Studies have shown\\nthat skin treated with these exfoliants has twice the sun\\ndamage compared to untreated skin. Therefore, it is im-\\nportant to use suncreen and avoid direct exposure to the\\nsun when using products containing BHAs.\\n• Sensitization to other products. The use of salicylic\\nacid sometimes sensitizes the skin to other cosmetics\\nand causes redness and irritation. In other to avoid skin\\nsensitization, it is best to use only mild cleansers and\\nwait at least 10–30 minutes before using another cos-\\nmetic or skin care product. Another way to avoid skin\\nsensitization is to use the BHA product every other day\\ninstead of daily.\\n• Stinging. Salicylic acid can produce a stinging sensa-\\ntion when first applied. That is because it is a mild skin\\nirritant. Products containing salicylic acid should not\\nbe applied on raw or abraded skin, as they may cause\\nredness and intense itching.\\n• Allergic reactions. Some salicylic acid products can\\nprovoke hypersensitivity reactions. Any products that\\ncause skin to burn, sting, redden, or break out should be\\ndiscontinued immediately.\\n• Blotchy skin. Sometimes BHA chemical peels cause\\nscarring and discoloration of some parts of the skin.\\nThis occurs most often with the more concentrated\\nBHA products. Scarring and blotchy skin also tend to\\noccur more frequently in people with darker skin.\\n• Dry skin. A person with dry skin should not use BHA\\ncleansers too frequently (more than once a week) be-\\ncause they tend to dry the skin even further.\\n• Eye irritation. Skin care products containing salicylic\\nacid tend to cause the eyes to redden and water. Avoid\\napplying these cleansers, cream or lotion too close to\\nthe eyes.\\nSide effects\\nPatients should stop using the product and contact\\ntheir doctors or pharmacists for advice if the following\\nadverse effects occur:\\n• dry skin\\n• eye irritation\\n• allergic reactions\\n• skin irritation\\nInteractions\\nBecause salicylic acid tends to sensitize the skin,\\nallow at least 10–30 minutes to elapse between the use of\\nproducts containing salicylic acid and applying cosmet-\\nics or other skin care products.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nSarnoff, Deborah S., and Joan Swirsky.

Betaine\\nhydrochloride (C5H12NO2Cl) is a source of hydrochloric\\nacid, a naturally occurring stomach acid that helps break up\\nfats and proteins for further digestion in the small intestine.\\nGastric (stomach) acid also aids in the absorption of nutri-\\nents through the walls of the intestines into the blood.\\nGastric acid also helps protect the gastrointestinal\\ntract from harmful bacteria. A normal level of gastric\\nacid in the stomach—100,000-1,000,000 times more\\nacidic than water—is sufficient to destroy bacteria, but a\\nlow level increases the likelihood and severity of certain\\nbacterial and parasitic intestinal infections . One study\\nshowed that fasting people with normal gastric acid lev-\\nels in the stomach had almost no bacteria in the small in-\\ntestine, while individuals with low levels of hydrochloric\\nacid had some bacterial colonization in the stomach.\\nBetaine hydrochloride is a synthesized chemical,\\nand is not obtained from any plant or animal source.\\nGastric acid is produced by stomach cells, and is not\\navailable from any food source. Occasionally, betaine\\n(C5H11NO2)is recommended to reduce blood levels of\\nhomocysteine, which is associated with heart disease .\\nThis form of betaine is different from betaine hydrochlo-\\nride, and is available only with a doctor’s prescription.\\nGeneral use\\nSome research suggests that individuals with a wide\\nvariety of chronic disorders, such as allergies, asthma,\\nand gallstones , do not produce adequate amounts of\\nstomach acid. Many people with rheumatoid arthritis\\nare deficient in stomach acid and other digestive factors.\\nTaking betaine hydrochloride with meals can aid in pro-\\ntein digestion and possibly reduce food sensitivities\\nthrough improved digestion.\\nNaturopaths have long held that low stomach acid is\\na widespread problem that interferes with the digestion\\nand absorption of nutrients. Betaine hydrochloride is one\\nof the most common recommendations for this condi-\\ntion. It helps make some minerals and other nutrients\\nmore absorbable, and may be especially helpful with nu-\\ntritional supplements, which are often taken in tablets or\\ncapsules that may not be easily digested.\\nBased on naturopathic theories about the importance\\nof stomach acid, betaine hydrochloride has been recom-\\nmended for a wide variety of problems, including ane-\\nmia, asthma, atherosclerosis, diarrhea, excess candida\\nyeast, food allergies, gallstones, hay fever and allergies,\\ninner ear infections, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid\\nconditions. Many naturopathic physicians also believe\\nthat betaine hydrochloride can help conditions such as\\nulcers,indigestion, and esophageal reflux ( heartburn).\\nConventional treatment for those conditions involves re-\\nducing stomach acid; according to one theory, however,\\nlack of stomach acid leads to incomplete digestion of\\nproteins, which causes allergic reactions and other re-\\nsponses that lead to increased ulcer pain. In keeping\\nwith this theory, some doctors might recommend animal-\\nderived pancreatic enzymes for patients experiencing al-\\nlergic reactions to food. Vegetarians may wish to take be-\\ntaine hydrochloride as an alternative to pancreatic en-\\nzymes, since it is not an animal product. Individuals suf-\\nfering from allergies, ulcers, or heartburn should talk to\\ntheir doctors before using betaine hydrochloride.\\nBetaine hydrochloride may be used as a lipotropic.\\nLipotropics aid in preventing the accumulation of fat in\\nthe liver, and usually help in the detoxification of meta-\\nbolic wastes and toxins. They may be used to help with\\nweight loss.\\nBenefits of lipotropics\\n• Detoxification of the waste byproducts of protein syn-\\nthesis.\\n• Increasing resistance to disease by stimulating the thy-\\nmus gland.\\n• Stepping up production of lecithin in the liver, which\\ncan lower cholesterol levels.\\n• Preventing plaque deposits in arteries.\\n• Preventing gallstone formation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 211\\nBetaine hydrochloride\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 211'),\n",

Tests have suggested that\\ndosages from 1.5-3 g a day are required to achieve de-\\nsired results.\\nPrecautions\\nAs a food supplement found in every cell of the\\nhuman body, it has no toxic effects, according to the re-\\nsearch conducted. Because no long-term studies had\\nbeen conducted on children, or pregnant or lactating\\nwomen, the supplement could not be recommended for\\nthese groups. Thus, these groups of people should con-\\nsult a physician, and use HMB with caution.\\nSide effects\\nAccording to Abumrad, the only side effects discov-\\nered have been positive ones. Yet the benefits of lower\\ncholesteroland blood pressure levels found to occur with\\nthe use of the supplement, were also associated with the\\nintense exercise that seems to trigger HMB’s tissue-build-\\ning effects. As Hearn reported, “That stands in stark con-\\ntrast to the side effects of unprescribed steroid use by ath-\\nletes and bodybuilders, which has been linked to cancer,\\nheart disease, kidney and liver damage, and erratic mood\\nswings.” Studies were ongoing to determine what other\\npossible benefits or disadvantages HMB would prove to\\nbe for the long-term period of usage. Physicians were\\nurged to add caution to their patients regarding this sup-\\nplement to be alert to any unforeseen complications. In\\n2000, various websites offer testimony for or against\\nusage. Those who recommend against it do so only in of-\\nfering that it did not appear to be of any use, and did not\\nprovide them with the touted benefits.\\nInteractions\\nNo known adverse reactions have yet been docu-\\nmented when HMB is taken with other drugs or food\\nsupplements.

Everyone ob-\\nserved an identical weight-training regimen three times a\\nweek. Upon the trial’s completion, the group who took\\nthe HMB demonstrated an average 3.1% increase in lean\\nmuscle mass, as compared with 1.9% for those who took\\nthe placebos. Also, the HMB group lost an average of\\n7.3% initial body fat, against 2.2% for the placebo\\ngroup. The men who took HMB were able to average 22\\npounds more with the bench press than they did at the\\nbeginning of the study. The men who did not, averaged a\\n14 pound increase. Thus, when taken as a supplement,\\nup to 3 g a day, HMB has been shown to increase lean\\nmuscle mass and strength in athletes who use it during\\nweight training. Theories suggest that HMB possibly\\nsuppresses protein breakdown that follows exercise that\\nis rigorous and of long-term duration.\\nThe patent for HMB is held jointly by Iowa State\\nUniversity and Vanderbilt University, which conducted\\nthe first studies on the compound. Experimental and Ap-\\nplied Sciences, Inc. (EAS)of Golden, Colorado, was\\noriginally licensed to market it. As of 2000, dozens of\\ncompanies have it available for sale through retail stores,\\nand commercial websites.\\nGeneral use\\nBy the Summer Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, the\\npublicity of the possible benefits of HMB had spread\\namong athletes. Because it was not a banned substance,\\ndemand was heavy; it continues to remain popular\\namong athletes as a nutritional supplement. This is true\\nparticularly for weight trainers, but has been reported as\\nuseful for any athlete undergoing resistance training. It is\\nconsidered a “state-of-the-art” bodybuilding supplement,\\nand tends to show an increase of lean mass and strength\\namong those who use it. Studies have also shown that\\nHMB might also accelerate fat loss that occurs sec-\\nondary to strenuous exercise. According to Wayne Hearn\\nin American Medical News in August of 1996, Dr. Naji\\nN. Abumrad, MD, originally with the Vanderbilt team,\\nbegan to conduct studies in 1996 that explored HMB’s\\n“potential use as an antiwasting agent that could benefit\\nAIDSand cancer patients and help maintain muscle\\nmass in the elderly.” This research remains as ongoing.\\nPreparations\\nHMB is available in both powder and capsule form,\\nwith capsule form being the primary method of usage.

A practitioner of bhakti yoga\\nregards God as present in every person or sentient being.\\nAlthough bhakti yoga developed within a Hindu culture, it\\ncan be practiced by members of Western religions, as it fo-\\ncuses the believer’s mind and heart on God as a supreme\\nPerson rather than an impersonal Absolute. Unlike hatha\\nyoga, which is the form of yoga most familiar to Ameri-\\ncans, bhakti yoga does not place great emphasis on breath-\\ning patterns or asanas (physical postures), but rather on\\nacts of worship, devotion, and service.\\nOrigins\\nBhakti yoga is thought by some to be the oldest\\nform of yoga, with its roots in the Vedas, or ancient\\nscriptures of India. Some of the hymns in the Vedas are\\nthought to be four thousand years old. Bhakti yoga did\\nnot emerge as a distinctive form of yoga, however, until\\nabout 500 B.C., the time of the composition of the Bha-\\ngavad-Gita, a Sanskrit work containing the teachings of\\nKrishna, one of the most beloved of Hindu deities.\\nBhakti yoga eventually became the focus of a popu-\\nlar devotional movement in India known as the bhakti-\\nmarga or “road of devotion.” This movement flourished\\nbetween 800 and 1100 A.D.. Around 900, devotees of Kr-\\nishna who belonged to the bhakti-marga produced a\\nscripture known as the Bhagavad-Purana , which con-\\ntains Krishna’s instructions to his worshipers. In one\\npassage from the Bhagavad-Purana , Krishna praises\\nbhakti above all other paths to bliss. He is represented as\\nsaying, “The wise person should abandon bad company\\nand associate with the virtuous, for the virtuous ones\\nsever the mind’s attachments [to worldly concerns] by\\ntheir utterances.. O greatly blessed devotee, these\\nblessed ones constantly tell my story, by listening to\\nwhich people are released from sin. Those who respect-\\nfully listen to, esteem, and recite my story become dedi-\\ncated to me and attain faith and devotion to me.”\\nBenefits\\nThe chief benefit of bhakti yoga, from the perspec-\\ntive of its practitioners, is greater love for and closeness\\nto God, and to other people (and all beings) as reflections\\nof God. Although bhakti yoga is also beneficial to mental\\nand physical well-being, improved health is not the pri-\\nmary reason most adherents choose this form of yoga.\\nDescription\\nThe Hindu sacred texts list nine forms of bhakti\\nyoga:\\n• Sravana. Sravana is the Sanskrit term for listening to\\npoems or stories about God’s virtues and mighty deeds.\\nSravana bhakti cannot be practiced in isolation, howev-\\ner; the devotee must hear the stories from a wise\\nteacher, and seek the companionship of holy people.\\n• Kirtana. Kirtana refers to singing or chanting God’s\\npraises. Ram Dass has said of this form of bhakti\\n“When you are in love with God, the very sound of the\\nName brings great joy.”\\n• Smarana. Smarana is remembrance of God at all times,\\nor keeping God in the forefront of one’s consciousness.\\nIn Christian terms, smarana is what the French monk\\nBrother Lawrence (1605–1691) meant by “the practice\\nof the presence of God.”\\n• Padasevana. This form of bhakti yoga expresses love to-\\nward God through service to others, especially the sick.\\n• Archana. Archana refers to worship of God through\\nsuch external images as icons or religious pictures, or\\nthrough internal visualizations. The purpose of archana\\nis to purify the heart through love of God.\\n• Vandana. Vandana refers to prayer and prostration\\n(lying face downward on the ground with arms out-\\nstretched). This form of bhakti yoga is intended to curb\\nself-absorption and self-centeredness.\\n• Dasya. In dasya bhakti, the devotee regards him- or\\nherself as God’s slave or servant, carrying out God’s\\ncommandments, meditating on the words of God, car-\\ning for the sick and the poor, and helping to clean or re-\\npair sacred buildings or places.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2214\\nBhakti yoga\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 214'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 231}, page_content='• Sakha-bhava. This form of bhakti yoga is a cultivation\\nof friendship-love toward God—to love God as a mem-\\nber of one’s family or dearest friend, and delight in\\ncompanionship with God.\\n• Atma-nivedana. Atma-nivedana is complete self-offer-\\ning or self-surrender to God. Unlike some other forms\\nof yoga, however, bhakti yoga does not teach that the\\ndevotee completely loses his or her personal identity\\nthrough absorption into the divine. God is regarded as\\ninfinitely greater than the human worshiper, even one at\\nthe highest levels of spiritual attainment.\\nThe nine types of bhakti yoga are not considered a\\nhierarchy in the sense that some are regarded as superior\\nto others in guiding people toward God. An Indian\\nteacher of bhakti yoga has said, “A devotee can take up\\nany of these paths and reach the highest state. The path\\nof bhakti is the easiest of all [types of yoga] and is not\\nvery much against the nature of human inclinations. It\\nslowly and gradually takes the individual to the Supreme\\nwithout frustrating his [sic] human instincts.”\\nPreparations\\nThe practice of bhakti yoga does not require any\\nspecial physical or emotional preparation. It is a good\\nidea, however, for Western readers to gather more in-\\nformation about a specific form of bhakti yoga that\\nmay interest or attract them. This preparation is partic-\\nularly important because the tendency of Western cul-\\nture to separate intellect from feeling leads many peo-\\nple to think of bhakti as sheer emotional fervor that\\ndoes not engage the mind, whereas many of the great\\nteachers of bhakti yoga were known for their wisdom\\nand mindfulness as well as intensity of devotion. Use-\\nful resources for learning more about bhakti yoga in-\\nclude such periodicals as Yoga Journal and the various\\norganizations listed below.\\nPrecautions\\nBhakti yoga tends to attract persons of a strongly\\nemotional nature. There is some risk, however, of such\\nindividuals remaining spiritually immature or joining\\ncult-like groups. The Hare Krishna movement, for exam-\\nple, is an offshoot of one school of bhakti yoga, the\\nGaudiya vaishnava tradition. Although some members of\\nthe movement consider their participation meaningful,\\nothers have left because they experienced it as repressive\\nand intolerant of other faiths.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects associated with the\\npractice of bhakti yoga.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nA number of research studies have shown that such\\nspiritual and devotional practices as those associated\\nwith bhakti yoga have positive effects on physical as\\nwell as emotional health. The positive physical effects\\ninclude strengthening of the immune system, lowered\\nblood pressure, and improved ability to cope with chron-\\nic pain. Chanting or hymn singing (kirtana) has been\\nshown to be particularly effective in pain management.\\nSeveral research studies published in early 2004 re-\\nport that all forms of yoga are becoming increasingly\\npopular among Americans over 40—particularly women\\nand people living in urban areas—for general wellness as\\nwell as back pain or other specific health problems. At\\nleast 15 million adults in the United States have partici-\\npated in yoga programs, according to a study conducted\\nat Harvard Medical School. Ninety percent of those con-\\ntacted by telephone in a research sample said that they\\nfound yoga very or somewhat helpful. A survey of can-\\ncer patients in a supportive care program at Stanford Uni-\\nversity found that yoga and massage therapy were the\\nactivities that drew the largest number of participants.\\nTraining & certification\\nThere are no international or nationwide licensing or\\ncredentialing procedures for spiritual guides or teachers\\nof bhakti yoga.

Bilberry\\nis a small, wild, perennial shrub that grows throughout\\nEurope and is now cultivated from the Far East to the\\nUnited States. The shrub yields large amounts of small,\\ndarkish blue berries. Besides their medicinal use, they\\nare often eaten fresh or made into jams and preserves.\\nThe leaves of the plant are used medicinally as well, but\\nto a lesser extent than the berries. The qualities of the\\nherb are sour, astringent, cold, and drying.\\nBilberry has been used by European herbalists for\\ncenturies. In Elizabethan times, bilberries were mixed\\nwith honey and made into a syrup called rob that was\\nprescribed for diarrhea and stomach problems. The\\nberries were also used for infections, scurvy, and kidney\\nstones. The leaves of the plant were used as a folk reme-\\ndy for diabetes. Bilberry is most famous, though, for its\\nlong use as a medicine for eye and vision problems. Leg-\\nend has it that during World War II, British and Ameri-\\ncan pilots discovered that eating bilberry jam before\\nnight missions greatly improved their night vision. Bil-\\nberries then became a staple for Air Force pilots. Since\\nthen, extensive research in Europe has shown that bilber-\\nries contain specific compounds that have beneficial ef-\\nfects on the eyes and circulatory system. In France, bil-\\nberries have been prescribed since 1945 for diabetic\\nretinopathy, a major cause of blindness in diabetics.\\nBilberries are high in substances called flavonoids ,\\nwhich are found in many fruits, vegetables, grains, beans,\\npeas, and are particularly abundant in citrus fruits and\\nberries. Flavonoids are chemicals technically known as\\npolyphenols. Flavonoids have antioxidant and disease-\\nfighting properties. Antioxidants are substances that help\\ncells in the body resist and repair damage. The flavonoids\\nfound in bilberry provide the blue color of the berry. The\\nbilberry flavonoids are called anthocyanosides , which\\nwere found to be the main active ingredients.\\nBilberry flavonoids can increase certain enzymes\\nand substances in the eyes that are crucial to good vision\\nand eye function. Furthermore, anthocyanosides can in-\\ncrease circulation in the blood vessels in the eyes, and\\nhelp these blood vessels repair and protect themselves.\\nSpecifically, research has shown that anthocyanosides\\nhelp stabilize and protect a protein called collagen,\\nwhich is a basic building block of veins, arteries, capil-\\nlaries, and connective tissue. Particularly, anthocyano-\\nsides seem to work favorably in the tissues found in the\\nretina, the back of the eye where major functions of vi-\\nsion take place. The retina is composed of millions of\\ntiny nerve cells and blood vessels, which anthocyano-\\nsides can help support. Bilberry is a common treatment\\nfor many varieties of retinopathy, a disorder in which the\\nintricate blood and nerve vessels in the retina are dam-\\naged. Retinopathy particularly affects people with dia-\\nbetes, high blood pressure, and sickle cell anemia.\\nMany studies have documented bilberry’s useful-\\nness as a medicinal herb. One study demonstrated that\\nbilberry extract used with Vitamin E prevented the pro-\\ngression of cataracts in 48 of 50 patients with cataract\\nformations. In animal studies, bilberry reduced and sta-\\nbilized blood sugar levels. In an Italian study, bilberry’s\\nflavonoids lowered cholesterol levels in the blood and\\nimproved circulation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2216\\nBilberry\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAsanas—Physical postures associated with the\\npractice of hatha yoga.\\nSanskrit—The classical literary language of India.\\nIt is considered the oldest living language of the\\nIndo-Aryan family.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 216'),\n",

The binge eater\\nconsumes unnaturally large amounts of food in a short\\ntime period, but unlike a bulimic, doesn’t regularly en-\\ngage in any inappropriate weight-reducing behaviors\\n(like excessive exercise , vomiting , taking laxatives)\\nafter the binge episodes.\\nGeneral use\\nBilberry is most commonly used as a component of\\ntreatment for various vision and eye disorders, including\\nglaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration. However,\\npeople with glaucoma should be monitored by an eye doctor\\nregularly, and those with acute glaucoma should not depend\\non bilberry alone to protect their vision. They can use bilber-\\nry along with other emergency medical treatments. Bilberry\\nis included in the treatments for many types of retinopathy\\nand is also used for eye fatigue, poor night vision, and near-\\nsightedness. It can be used as a preventative measure for\\nglaucoma and cataracts, and to help those who require pre-\\ncise night vision like cab drivers and pilots. Bilberry’s circu-\\nlation improving and cholesterol lowering qualities make it\\nuseful in the treatment of varicose veinsand atherosclero-\\nsis. It is also occasionally prescribed for arthritis.\\nPreparations\\nFresh bilberries can be eaten like blueberries, al-\\nthough they are difficult to find outside of Europe. Two\\nto four ounce servings of the fresh fruit can be eaten\\nthree times a day. One to two cups each day is a good\\ndose. Dried bilberries are sometimes available in herb or\\norganic health food stores, and two or three small hand-\\nfuls can be eaten per day. However, dried berries are\\nlikely to contain only a small amount of the flavonoids.\\nBilberry supplements are widely available in health\\nfood stores. They can be purchased as capsules and liq-\\nuid extracts. A high-quality supplement may contain a\\nstandardized formula of up to 25% anthocyanocides. The\\ndosage recommended with this percentage of active in-\\ngredients is 80-160 mg taken three times daily. Bilberry\\nsupplements may be taken with food or on an empty\\nstomach. Bilberry jam and syrup may also be used.\\nFor eye and circulatory problems, bilberry can be\\ntaken with ginkgo to increase its beneficial effects. Vita-\\nmins A, C and E may also enhance bilberry’s healing ef-\\nfects in the eye. Some suggestions have been made that\\nother flavonoid-containing supplements, such as pine\\nbark extract and grape seed extract , can possibly en-\\nhance bilberry’s healing properties.\\nPrecautions\\nBilberry may be used as prevention and herbal sup-\\nport for eye conditions, but should not replace medical\\ncare. Consumers with vision problems should be thor-\\noughly and immediately examined by an ophthalmologist\\n(eye specialist) before any treatment or remedy is used.\\nSide effects\\nBilberries can be taken in large doses without any\\nside effects. However, bilberry leaves shouldn’t be taken\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 217\\nBinge eating disorder\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAtherosclerosis —Disease in which the arteries\\nand circulation are impaired from hardening and\\nclogging, often from high cholesterol levels.\\nCataracts —Eye condition in which the lenses\\nharden and lose their clarity.\\nGlaucoma—Eye disease that can cause blindness;\\ncharacterized by excess fluid between the iris and\\ncornea of the eye.\\nMacular degeneration —Disease in which the\\nmacula, the part of the retina responsible for pre-\\ncise vision, deteriorates.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 217'),\n",

BED typically\\nstrikes individuals between their adolescent years and\\ntheir early 20s. Because of the nature of the disorder,\\nmost BED patients are overweight or obese. Studies of\\nweight loss programs have shown that an average of\\n30% of individuals enrolling in these programs report\\nbinge eating behavior. Binge eating in milder forms is\\neven more common, as are attempts to compensate for\\nthe binges.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBinge eating episodes may act as a psychological\\nrelease for excessive emotional stress. Other circum-\\nstances that may predispose an individual to BED in-\\nclude heredity and mood disorders, such as major de-\\npression . BED patients are also more likely to have an\\nadditional diagnosis of impulsive behaviors (for exam-\\nple, compulsive shopping),post-traumatic stress disor-\\nder (PTSD), panic disorder , or personality disorders.\\nMore than half also have a history of major depression.\\nIn 2002, the American Psychiatric Association was con-\\nsidering including BED as a psychiatric diagnosis.\\nIndividuals who develop BED often come from fam-\\nilies who put an unnatural emphasis on the importance of\\nfood. For example, these families may use food as a\\nsource of comfort in times of emotional distress. As chil-\\ndren, BED patients may have been taught to clean their\\nplates regardless of their appetite, or to be a good girl or\\nboy and finish all of the meal. Cultural attitudes towards\\nbeauty and thinness may also be a factor in BED.\\nDuring binge episodes, BED patients experience a\\ndefinite sense of lost control over their eating. They eat\\nquickly and to the point of discomfort, even if they aren’t\\nhungry. They typically binge alone two or more times a\\nweek, and often feel depressed and guilty when the\\nepisode is over.\\nDiagnosis\\nBED is usually diagnosed and treated by a psychia-\\ntrist and/or a psychologist. In addition to an interview\\nwith the patient, personality and behavioral inventories,\\nsuch as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory\\n(MMPI), may be administered as part of the assessment\\nprocess. One of several clinical inventories, or scales,\\nmay also be used to assess depressive symptoms, includ-\\ning the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) or Beck\\nDepression Inventory (BDI). These tests may be admin-\\nistered in an outpatient or hospital setting.\\nTreatment\\nMany BED individuals binge after long periods of\\nexcessive dieting; therapy helps normalize this pattern.\\nThe initial goal of BED treatment is to teach the patient\\nto gain control over his or her eating behavior by focus-\\ning on eating regular meals and avoiding snacking. Cog-\\nnitive behavioral therapy , group therapy, or interper-\\nsonal psychotherapy may be used to uncover the emo-\\ntional motives, distorted thinking, and behavioral pat-\\nterns behind the binge eating. The overweight BED\\npatient may be placed on a moderate exercise program\\nand a nutritionist may be consulted to educate the patient\\non healthy food choices and strategies for weight loss.\\nInitial treatment may focus on curbing the depression\\nthat is a characteristic feature of BED. Recommended\\nherbal remedies to ease the symptoms of depression may\\ninclude damiana (Turnera diffusa), ginseng (Panax gin-\\nseng), kola (Cola nitida), lady’s slipper (Cypripedium cal-\\nceolus), lavender (Lavandula angustifolia), lime blossom\\n(Tilia x vulgaris), oats (Avena sativa), rosemary (Rosmar-\\ninus officinalis ), skullcap (Scutellaria laterifolia ), St.\\nJohn’s wort (Hypericum perforatum ), valerian (Valeri-\\nana officinalis), and vervain (Verbena officinalis).\\nBinge-eating episodes that appear to be triggered by\\nstress may be curbed by educating the patient in relaxation\\nexercises and techniques, including aromatherapy, breath-\\ning exercises,biofeedback, music therapy, yoga, and mas-\\nsage. Herbs known as adaptogens may also be prescribed by\\nan herbalist or holistic healthcare professional. These herbs\\nare thought to promote adaptability to stress, and include\\nSiberian ginseng(Eleutherococcus senticosus), ginseng\\n(Panax ginseng), wild yam (Dioscorea villosa), borage (Bor-\\nago officinalis), licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), chamomile\\n(Chamaemelum nobile), and nettles (Urtica dioica). Tonics\\nof skullcap (Scutellaria lateriafolia), and oats (Avena sativa),\\nmay also be recommended to ease anxiety.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment with antidepressants may be prescribed\\nfor BED patients. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(such as Prozac) are usually preferred because they offer\\nfewer side effects. However, clinical studies don’t show\\nmuch effectiveness for use of antidepressants in treating\\nBED. Psychotherapy shows better results. Once the\\nbinge eating behavior is curbed and depressive symp-\\ntoms are controlled, the physical symptoms of the disor-\\nder can be addressed.\\nExpected results\\nThe poor dietary habits and obesity that are sympto-\\nmatic of BED can lead to serious health problems, such as\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2218\\nBinge eating disorder\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 218'),\n",

The name biofeedback refers to the biological sig-\\nnals that are fed back, or returned, to the patient in order for\\nthe patient to develop techniques of manipulating them.\\nOrigins\\nIn 1961, Neal Miller, an experimental psychologist,\\nsuggested that autonomic nervous system responses (for in-\\nstance, heart rate, blood pressure, gastrointestinal activity,\\nregional blood flow) could be under voluntary control. As a\\nresult of his experiments, he showed that such autonomic\\nprocesses were controllable. This work led to the creation\\nof biofeedback therapy. Willer’s work was expanded by\\nother researchers. Thereafter, research performed in the\\n1970s by UCLA researcher Dr. Barry Sterman established\\nthat both cats and monkeys could be trained to control their\\nbrain wave patterns. Sterman then used his research tech-\\nniques on human patients with epilepsy, where he was able\\nto reduce seizures by 60% with the use of biofeedback tech-\\nniques. Throughout the 1970s, other researchers published\\nreports of their use of biofeedback in the treatment of car-\\ndiac arrhythmias, headaches,Raynaud’s syndrome, and\\nexcess stomach acid, and as a tool for teaching deep relax-\\nation. Since the early work of Miller and Sterman, biofeed-\\nback has developed into a front-line behavioral treatment\\nfor an even wider range of disorders and symptoms.\\nBenefits\\nBiofeedback has been used to successfully treat a\\nnumber of disorders and their symptoms, including tem-\\npromandibular joint disorder (TMJ), chronic pain,irrita-\\nble bowel syndrome (IBS), Raynaud’s syndrome,\\nepilepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\nhigh blood pressure, heart attacks, and diabetes, if left\\nunchecked. BED is a chronic condition that requires ongo-\\ning medical and psychological management. To bring\\nlong-term relief to the BED patient, it is critical to address\\nthe underlying psychological causes behind binge eating\\nbehaviors. It appears that up to 50% of BED patients will\\nstop bingeing with cognitive behavioral therapy.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAbraham, Suzanne and Derek Llewellyn-Jones.

By monitoring this relationship\\nbetween mind and body, the patient can then use these\\nsame thoughts and mental images as subtle cues, as these\\nact as reminders to become deeply relaxed, instead of anx-\\nious. These reminders also work to manipulate heart beat,\\nbrain wave patterns, body temperature, and other bodily\\nfunctions. This is achieved through relaxation exercises,\\nmental imagery, and other cognitive therapy techniques.\\nAs the biofeedback response takes place, patients\\ncan actually see or hear the results of their efforts in-\\nstantly through the sensor readout on the biofeedback\\nequipment. Once these techniques are learned and the\\npatient is able to recognize the state of relaxation or vi-\\nsualization necessary to alleviate symptoms, the biofeed-\\nback equipment itself is no longer needed. The patient\\nthen has a powerful, portable, and self-administered\\ntreatment tool to deal with problem symptoms.\\nBiofeedback that specializes in reading and altering\\nbrain waves is sometimes called neurofeedback . The\\nbrain produces four distinct types of brain waves—delta,\\ntheta, alpha, and beta—that all operate at a different fre-\\nquency. Delta, the slowest frequency wave, is the brain\\nwave pattern associated with sleep. Beta waves, which\\noccur in a normal, waking state, can range from 12-35\\nHz. Problems begin to develop when beta wave averages\\nfall in the low end (underarousal) or the high end (over-\\narousal) of that spectrum. Underarousal might be present\\nin conditions such as depression or attention-deficit dis-\\norder, and overarousal may be indicative of an anxiety\\ndisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or excessive\\nstress. Beta wave neurofeedback focuses on normalizing\\nthat beta wave pattern to an optimum value of around 14\\nHz. A second type of neurofeedback, alpha-theta, focus-\\nes on developing the more relaxing alpha (8-13 Hz) and\\ntheta waves (4-9 Hz) that are usually associated with\\ndeep, meditative states, and has been used with some\\nsuccess in substance abuse treatment.\\nThrough brain wave manipulation, neurofeedback\\ncan be useful in treating a variety of disorders that are\\nsuspected or proven to impact brain wave patterns, such\\nas epilepsy, attention-deficit disorder, migraine\\nheadaches, anxiety, depression, traumatic brain injury,\\n(ADHD), migraine headaches, anxiety , depression ,\\ntraumatic brain injury, and sleep disorders.\\nIllnesses that may be triggered at least in part by\\nstress are also targeted by biofeedback therapy. Certain\\ntypes of headaches, high blood pressure, bruxism (teeth\\ngrinding), post-traumatic stress disorder, eating disor-\\nders, substance abuse, and some anxiety disorders may\\nbe treated successfully by teaching patients the ability to\\nrelax and release both muscle and mental tension.\\nBiofeedback is often just one part of a comprehensive\\ntreatment program for some of these disorders.\\nNASA has used biofeedback techniques to treat astro-\\nnauts who suffer from severe space sickness, during which\\nthe autonomic nervous system is disrupted. Scientists at the\\nUniversity of Tennessee have adapted these techniques to\\ntreat individuals suffering from severe nauseaand vomiting\\nthat is also rooted in autonomic nervous system dysfunction.\\nRecent research also indicates that biofeedback may\\nbe a useful tool in helping patients with urinary inconti-\\nnence regain bladder control. Individuals learning pelvic-\\nfloor muscle strengthening exercises can gain better con-\\ntrol over these muscles by using biofeedback. Sensors are\\nplaced on the muscles to train the patient where they are\\nand when proper contractions are taking place.\\nDescription\\nDuring biofeedback, special sensors are placed on\\nthe body.

The\\nmonitor displays specific patterns that the patient at-\\ntempts to change by producing the appropriate type of\\nbrain wave. Or, the monitor may reward the patient for\\nproducing the appropriate brain wave by producing a\\npositive reinforcer, or reward. For example, children may\\nbe rewarded with a series of successful moves in a dis-\\nplayed video game.\\nDepending on the type of biofeedback, individuals\\nmay need up to 30 sessions with a trained professional to\\nlearn the techniques required to control their symptoms\\non a long-term basis. Therapists usually recommend that\\ntheir patients practice both biofeedback and relaxation\\ntechniques on their own at home.\\nPreparations\\nBefore initiating biofeedback treatment, the thera-\\npist and patient will have an initial consultation to record\\nthe patients medical history and treatment background\\nand discuss goals for therapy.\\nBefore a neurofeedback session, an EEG is taken\\nfrom the patient to determine his or her baseline brain-\\nwave pattern.\\nBiofeedback typically is performed in a quiet and\\nrelaxed atmosphere with comfortable seating for the pa-\\ntient.

Both led to his most noted work, the influ-\\nence on the birth of the biofeedback movement. While\\nthe mechanics of moving parts and machinery lured the\\ninvestigator from LaGrand, Oregon, to his work as a civil-\\nian scientist with the Navy in the late 1940s, it was his\\nwife Alyce who caused him to ponder biophysiology and\\nhuman development. In 1953 she read a book titled The\\nHuman Senses by Frank Geldard. It was their interests as a\\ncouple that led to their continued education at the Uni-\\nversity of Chicago. In 1957 Green began work for his\\nPh.D. studies in biopsychology, while Alyce studied for\\nher Master’s degree in psychology.\\nNumerous opportunities, including assisting with\\nthe development of a machine for the automated detec-\\ntion of brain damage, led to his position at the Men-\\nninger Institute in Topeka, Kansas, in 1964. While there\\nhe established the psychophysiology laboratory and the\\nVoluntary Controls Program. It was his treatment of a\\ncolleague’s wife’s headaches that Green became con-\\nvinced that skin temperature was an autonomic nervous\\nsystem variable that was responsive to psychophysiolog-\\nic self-regulation aided by thermal biofeedback. By\\nlearning to control temperature he found that headache\\ncontrol could be enhanced. Green’s success attracted\\nsupport by several of the Menninger staff who also began\\nresearch and use of biofeedback therapy for headaches\\nand hypertension.\\nThe 1960s proved exciting for Green as he, Alyce,\\nand colleague Dale Walters became involved with EEG\\nBiofeedback, and studied the process of meditation—a\\ntherapy the Greens had long practiced. In April 1969,\\nGreen and his wife organized the Council Grove Con-\\nference for the study of the voluntary control of inter-\\nnal states. The conference served as a step toward\\nforming the Biofeedback Research Society, which later\\nbecame the Biofeedback Society of America, and cur-\\nrently the Association for Applied Psychophysiology\\nand Biofeedback.\\nTogether, Elmer and Alyce Green authored numer-\\nous papers, book chapters, and wrote the book, Beyond\\nBiofeedback (1977). They lectured throughout the United\\nStates and around the world for more than 20 years on\\nmultiple topics including EEG biofeedback training and\\npsychophysiologic control.\\nGreen co-founded the International Society For the\\nStudy of Subtle Energies and Energy Medicine (ISSSEEM)\\nin 1990 and served as its director.

They are compounds abundant in the pulp\\nand rinds of citrus fruits and other foods containing vita-\\nmin C , such as soybeans and root vegetables. Other\\nmajor sources of bioflavonoids include tea, vegetables\\nsuch as broccoli and eggplant,flaxseed , and whole\\ngrains. Bioflavonoids are active ingredients in many\\nherbal remedies. These include feverfew , Tanacetum\\nparthenium; Ginkgo biloba; licorice root, Glycyrrhiza\\nglabra; St. John’s wort , Hypericum perforatum; and\\nEchinacea spp.\\nBioflavonoids help maximize the benefits of vitamin\\nC by inhibiting its breakdown in the body. In 1935, Albert\\nSzent-Györgyi demonstrated that an extract he called cit-\\nrin, made from lemon peels, was more effective than pure\\nvitamin C in preventing scurvy. In 1936, Szent-Györgyi\\nfound that citrin was a mixture of bioflavonoids, includ-\\ning the flavone hesperidin and a flavonol glucoside.\\nSzent-Györgyi believed that bioflavonoids should be con-\\nsidered vitamins, but was not able to substantiate that\\nthey were essential nutrients. Still, many researchers and\\nphysicians believe that dietary intake of bioflavonoids is\\nbeneficial for blood vessel health and possibly for protec-\\ntion against heart disease.\\nBioflavonoids are categorized in a variety of ways,\\nsometimes with overlapping categories. Types of\\nbioflavonoids include flavones, isoflavonoids, flavanones\\n(such as catechins and naringin), and flavanols.\\nGeneral use\\nIn their natural state, bioflavonoids are usually\\nfound in close association with vitamin C. In treating\\nconditions, vitamin C and bioflavonoids each enhance\\nthe action of the other compound. Therefore, when taken\\nas supplements, they often should be used in combina-\\ntion to increase effectiveness. In general, all\\nbioflavonoids are potentially useful as antioxidants, an-\\ntivirals, and anti-inflammatories. Other health benefits of\\nthe various bioflavonoids include:\\n• preventing nosebleeds , miscarriages, postpartum\\nbleeding, and other types of hemorrhages\\n• the treatment and prevention of menstrual disorders\\n• protection against cancer and heart disease\\n• anticoagulant activity (preventing blood clotting)\\n• reducing the occurrence of easy bruising\\n• decreasing the cholesterol level\\n• improving symptoms related to aging\\n• protection against infections\\n• counteracting the effects of pollution, pesticides, rancid\\nfats, and alcohol\\n• ability to reduce pain\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 223\\nBioflavonoids\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 223'),\n",

It is help-\\nful in reducing weakness in the blood vessels and the re-\\nsultant hemorrhages. Rutin can relieve the pain from\\nbumps and bruises . Rutin may be taken to help reduce\\nserum cholesterol. It is also useful in treating rheumatic\\ndiseases such as gout, arthritis, systemic lupus erythe-\\nmatosus (a chronic disease marked by a rash on the face\\nwith a variety of symptoms), and ankylosing spondyli-\\ntis (condition affecting ligaments in the spine, involving\\nthe hips and shoulders). Rutin is most abundant in apri-\\ncots, buckwheat, cherries, prunes, rose hips, the whitish\\nrind of citrus fruits, and the core of green peppers.\\nAnthocyanins and proanthocyanidins can be used to\\ntreat a number of eye conditions such as cataracts, night\\nblindness, diabetic retinopathy (progressive retina dis-\\nease that is a complication of diabetes), and macular de-\\ngeneration (a hereditary condition causing loss of vi-\\nsion). They are also useful for strengthening the walls of\\nthe blood vessels, and therefore may help prevent bruis-\\ning, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and spider veins. These\\nbioflavonoids can help to prevent osteoporosis by stabi-\\nlizing collagen, the major protein in bone. They can re-\\nduce cholesterol deposits in arteries, and prevent damage\\nto the artery walls. These actions reduce the possibilities\\nof heart disease and strokes. Anthocyanins and proantho-\\ncyanidins can dilate the blood vessels and prevent blood\\nclots. Proanthocyanidins are able to cross the blood-\\nbrain barrier to protect the brain from damage by free\\nradicals and infection. Good sources of anthocyanins and\\nproanthocyanidins include blackberries, cranberries,\\nblack and green tea , raspberries, grapes, eggplant, red\\ncabbage, elderberries, and red wine.\\nHesperidin is useful in treating the complaints of\\nmenopause and in dealing with the viruses that cause\\nherpes, the flu, and certain respiratory ailments. Hes-\\nperidin fights allergic reactions by blocking the release\\nof histamine. It may also help reduce edema (accumula-\\ntion of fluid) in the legs. Hesperidin deficiency has been\\nlinked to weaknesses in the walls of the blood vessels,\\npain and weakness in the hands and feet, and leg cramps\\nat night. Hesperidin is mostly found in the pulps and\\nrinds of citrus fruits.\\nEllagic acid helps to inhibit cancer by neutralizing\\nthe effect of certain carcinogens. It is particularly helpful\\nin reducing the effects of nitrosamines, which are found\\nin tobacco and processed meat products such as bacon\\nand hot dogs. Ellagic acid reduces the effects of the toxic\\nand carcinogenic factors (aflatoxins) produced by As-\\npergillus flavus molds on food. Aflatoxins may cause\\nliver damage and cancer. Ellagic acid diminishes the ef-\\nfects of polycyclic hydrocarbons produced by tobacco\\nsmoke and air pollution, as well. Sources of ellagic acid\\ninclude strawberries, grapes, apples, cranberries, black-\\nberries, and walnuts.\\nQuercetin is a good antihistamine. It can help reduce\\nthe inflammation that results from hay fever, allergies,\\nbursitis, gout, arthritis, and asthma. It may lessen other\\nasthma symptoms. Quercetin stimulates detoxification\\nin the liver. It strengthens the blood vessels, and is useful\\nin treating atherosclerosis (plaque build-up in the arter-\\nies) and high cholesterol levels. It may help inhibit tumor\\nformation. Quercetin can be used to treat many of the\\ncomplications of diabetes. For example, it blocks the ac-\\ncumulation of sorbitol, which has been linked with\\nnerve, eye and kidney damage in diabetics; and it regu-\\nlates blood sugar levels. Quercetin inhibits the growth of\\nHelicobacter pylori,which has been implicated in the\\ndevelopment of peptic ulcers. It can also help diminish\\nthe effects of the herpes virus, the Epstein-Barr virus (a\\ncommon virus; a common cause of mononucleosis), and\\nthe polio virus. Quercetin is found in green tea, onion-\\nskins, kale, red cabbage, green beans, tomatoes, pota-\\ntoes, lettuce, strawberries, cherries, and grapes. It is also\\nfound in smaller amounts in many other foods.\\nCatechins and tannins can be used to stimulate\\ndetoxification by the liver and to strengthen the blood\\nvessels. They also help reduce the inflammatory re-\\nsponse. Catechins and tannins may help inhibit the for-\\nmation of tumors. In addition, catechins can be used to\\ninhibit the breakdown of collagen and to treat hepatitis\\nand arthritis. Catechins and tannins are both found in\\ngreen and black teas.\\nKaempferols stimulate liver detoxification and\\nstrengthen the blood vessels. They may also inhibit\\ntumor formation.

It is\\nused in Chinese healing and called bai zi ren. In English\\nbiota is sometimes called oriental arborvitae.\\nBiota is a slow-growing tree native to China. It\\ngrows to a height of about 45 ft (15 m) in moist, well-\\ndrained soils throughout East Asia. It tolerates air pollu-\\ntion well and will grow in cities. When cultivated, biota\\nproduces an abundant seed crop. The leaves and seeds\\nare used in healing. A yellow dye can be made from the\\nyoung branches. Many varieties of biota are used for or-\\nnamental landscaping.\\nBiota is an herb that is sometimes confused with\\nThuja occidentalis. Thuja is a North American tree in the\\ncedar family that is called American arborvitae. The\\nleaves of thuja are sometimes used by Western herbalists,\\nbut are used in very different ways from B. orientalis.\\nGeneral use\\nBiota is one of the less important of the 50 funda-\\nmental herbs of Chinese herbalism. In Chinese herbal-\\nism, biota is said to have a neutral nature and a sweet,\\nacid taste. It is associated primarily with the heart and di-\\ngestive system and is often a component of shen tonics.\\nBiota seeds are used as a sedative, to help disperse\\nanxiety and fear, and to reduce insomnia. Other uses are\\nstruation and menopause. Genestein is found in soy-\\nbeans and soy products.\\nPreparations\\nSince bioflavonoids are so widely available in fruits\\nin high concentrations, daily servings of whole fresh fruits\\nand fresh fruit juices should be consumed. Highly concen-\\ntrated liquid extracts of some fruits are also available.\\nPrecautions\\nBioflavonoids are generally safe, even at very high\\ndoses. However, pregnant women are advised not to take\\nmegadoses of bioflavonoids. Preliminary studies have in-\\ndicated that there may be a link between infant leukemia\\nand high doses of bioflavonoids in the mother.\\nSide effects\\nBioflavonoids are not toxic, even at high levels.\\nThey are water soluble, and therefore, any in excess of\\nwhat is needed by the body is excreted in the urine.\\nInteractions\\nBioflavonoids are usually found in close association\\nwith vitamin C, and they enhance its effect.

It has been\\nclaimed that, as part of an orthomolecular regime, it can\\nreverse the graying of hair. When PABA and biotin are\\ntaken together in adequate amounts they can restore hair\\ncolor. Biotin supplements will also effectively treat\\nweak, splitting nails.\\nBiotin can be a valuable tool to combat yeast infec-\\ntions, which are notoriously difficult to fight. In their\\nbook The Yeast Syndrome , John Parks Trowbridge and\\nMorton Walker describe how adequate levels of biotin\\ncan prevent Candida albicans from developing from its\\nyeast-like state into fungal form, in which it sends out\\nmycelium that further invade body organs.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis, or Leiner’s disease, which is\\na non-itchy, red scaling rash affecting infants during the\\nfirst three months of life, is also treated with biotin and\\nother B complex vitamins.\\nBiotin has been used in conjunction with other nu-\\ntrients as part of weight loss programs, as it aids in the\\ndigestion and breakdown of fats.\\nHigh doses of biotin are sometimes used by the allo-\\npathic medical profession to treat diabetes since it en-\\nhances sensitivity to insulin and effectively increases\\nlevels of enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. In\\n2002, one company started clinical trials testing a combi-\\nnation of chromium picolinate and biotin for treatment\\nof type 2 diabetes.

Biotin requirements increase\\nduring pregnancy and lactation. In 2002, an investigation\\noutlined the need for supplemental biotin during pregnan-\\ncy. Nearly 50 % of pregnant women appear to be defi-\\ncient in biotin, which could result in birth defects (at least\\naccording to animal studies). Researchers suggest that bi-\\notin be included in prenatal multivitamin formulas.\\nThose taking antibiotics should supplement their\\ndiets with biotin. Certain individuals are at risk for bi-\\notin deficiency, including infants fed biotin-deficient for-\\nmula or with inherited deficiency disorders, patients who\\nare fed intravenously, and anyone who habitually eats a\\nlot of raw egg whites, because they contain a protein\\ncalled avidin, which prevents the absorption of biotin.\\nMild deficiency\\nBecause it is synthesized in the gut, deficiency\\nsymptoms of biotin are rare. However they may include\\nweakness, lethargy, grayish skin color,eczema (which\\nmay include a scaly red rash around the nose, mouth and\\nother orifices),hair loss , cradle cap in infants, muscle\\naches, impaired ability to digest fats, nausea, depres-\\nsion, loss of appetite, insomnia, high cholesterol levels,\\neye inflammations, sensitivity to touch, anemia, and tin-\\ngling in the hands and feet.\\nExtreme deficiency\\nSymptoms of extreme biotin deficiency include ele-\\nvation of cholesterol levels, heart problems, and paraly-\\nsis. When extreme deficiency is a problem, the liver may\\nnot be able to detoxify the body efficiently, and depres-\\nsion may develop into hallucinations. Infants may exhib-\\nit developmental delay and lack of muscle tone.\\nBiotin deficiency could result in a loss of immune\\nfunction, since animal experiments have shown that bi-\\notin deficiency resulted in a decrease in white blood-cell\\nfunction. Because biotin is essential to the body’s meta-\\nbolic functions, any deficiency could result in impaired\\nmetabolism as well.\\nOverdose\\nThere have been no reports of effects of overdose of\\nbiotin, even at very high doses, primarily because any\\nexcess is excreted in the urine.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no side effects associated with biotin sup-\\nplementation.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 227\\nBiotin\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 227'),\n",

The major-\\nity of bipolar individuals experience alternating episodes\\nof mania and depression.\\nDescription\\nIn the United States alone, bipolar disorder afflicts\\napproximately 2.3 million people, and nearly 20% of this\\npopulation will attempt suicide without effective treat-\\nment intervention. The average age at onset of bipolar\\ndisorder is from adolescence through the early twenties.\\nHowever, because of the complexity of the disorder, a\\ncorrect diagnosis can be delayed for several years or\\nmore. In a survey of bipolar patients conducted by the\\nNational Depressive and Manic Depressive Association\\n(NDMDA), one-half of respondents reported visiting\\nthree or more professionals before receiving a correct di-\\nagnosis, and over one-third reported a wait of 10 years or\\nmore before they were correctly diagnosed.\\nThe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental\\nDisorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), the diagnostic stan-\\ndard for mental health professionals in the United States,\\ndefines four separate categories of bipolar disorder:\\nbipolar I, bipolar II, cyclothymia, and bipolar not-other-\\nwise-specified (NOS).\\nBipolar I disorder is characterized by manic\\nepisodes, the “high” of the manic-depressive cycle. A\\nbipolar patient experiencing mania often has feelings of\\nself-importance, elation, talkativeness, increased sociabil-\\nity, and a desire to embark on goal-oriented activities,\\ncoupled with the characteristics of irritability, impatience,\\nimpulsiveness, hyperactivity, and a decreased need for\\nsleep. Usually this manic period is followed by a period\\nof depression, although a few bipolar I individuals may\\nnot experience a major depressive episode. Mixed states,\\nwhere both manic or hypomanic symptoms and depres-\\nsive symptoms occur at the same time, also occur fre-\\nquently with bipolar I patients (for example, depression\\nwith racing thoughts of mania).

One-third of patients with cy-\\nclothymia will develop bipolar I or II disorder later in life.\\nA phenomenon known as rapid cycling occurs in up\\nto 20% of bipolar I and II patients. In rapid cycling,\\nmanic and depressive episodes must alternate frequently,\\nat least four times in 12 months, to meet the diagnostic\\ndefinition. In some cases of “ultra-rapid cycling,” the pa-\\ntient may bounce between manic and depressive states\\nseveral times within a 24-hour period. This condition is\\nvery hard to distinguish from mixed states.\\nBipolar NOS is a category for bipolar states that do not\\nclearly fit into the bipolar I, II, or cyclothymia diagnoses.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe source of bipolar disorder has not been clearly\\ndefined. Because two-thirds of bipolar patients have a\\nfamily history of affective or emotional disorders, re-\\nsearchers have searched for a genetic link to the disorder.\\nSeveral studies have uncovered a number of possible ge-\\nnetic connections to the predisposition for bipolar disor-\\nder. Recent studies emphasize a hereditary connection\\nand early research links several chromosomes, one par-\\nticularly related to bipolar II, to development of the dis-\\norder. A 2003 study found that schizophrenia and bipo-\\nlar disorder could have similar genetic causes that arise\\nfrom certain problems with genes associated with myelin\\ndevelopment in the central nervous system. (Myelin is a\\nwhite, fat-like substance that forms a sort of layer or\\nsheath around nerve fibers.)\\nAnother possible biological cause under investiga-\\ntion is the presence of an excessive calcium build-up in\\nthe cells of bipolar patients. Also, dopamine and other\\nneurochemical transmitters appear to be implicated in\\nbipolar disorder and these are under intense investigation.\\nOver one-half of patients diagnosed with bipolar\\ndisorder have a history of substance abuse. There is a\\nhigh rate of association between cocaine abuse and bipo-\\nlar disorder. Some studies have shown up to 30% of\\nabusers meeting the criteria for bipolar disorder. The\\nemotional and physical highs and lows of cocaine use\\ncorrespond to the manic depression of the bipolar pa-\\ntient, making the disorder difficult to diagnose.\\nFor some bipolar patients, manic and depressive\\nepisodes coincide with seasonal changes. Depressive\\nepisodes are typical during winter and fall, and manic\\nepisodes are more probable in the spring and summer\\nmonths.\\nSymptoms of bipolar depressive episodes include\\nlow energy levels, feelings of despair, difficulty concen-\\ntrating, extreme fatigue, and psychomotor retardation\\n(slowed mental and physical capabilities). Manic\\nepisodes are characterized by feelings of euphoria, lack\\nof inhibitions, racing thoughts, diminished need for\\nsleep, talkativeness, risk taking, and irritability. In ex-\\ntreme cases, mania can induce hallucinations and other\\npsychotic symptoms such as grandiose illusions.\\nDiagnosis\\nBipolar disorder usually is diagnosed and treated by\\na psychiatrist and/or a psychologist with medical assis-\\ntance. In addition to an interview, several clinical inven-\\ntories or scales may be used to assess the patient’s men-\\ntal status and determine the presence of bipolar symp-\\ntoms. These include the Millon Clinical Multiaxial In-\\nventory III (MCMI-III), Minnesota Multiphasic\\nPersonality Inventory II (MMPI-2), the Internal State\\nScale (ISS), the Self-Report Manic Inventory (SRMI),\\nand the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). The tests\\nare verbal and/or written and are administered in both\\nhospital and outpatient settings.\\nPsychologists and psychiatrists typically use the cri-\\nteria listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of\\nMental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) as a guide-\\nline for diagnosis of bipolar disorder and other mental\\nillnesses. DSM-IV describes a manic episode as an ab-\\nnormally elevated or irritable mood lasting a period of at\\nleast one week that is distinguished by at least three of\\nthe mania symptoms: inflated self-esteem, decreased\\nneed for sleep, talkativeness, racing thoughts, dis-\\ntractibility, increase in goal-directed activity, or exces-\\nsive involvement in pleasurable activities that have a\\nhigh potential for painful consequences. If the mood of\\nthe patient is irritable and not elevated, four of the symp-\\ntoms are required.\\nAlthough many clinicians find the criteria too rigid,\\na hypomanic diagnosis requires a duration of at least\\nfour days with at least three of the symptoms indicated\\nfor manic episodes (four if mood is irritable and not ele-\\nvated). DSM-IV notes that unlike manic episodes, hypo-\\nmanic episodes do not cause a marked impairment in so-\\ncial or occupational functioning, do not require hospital-\\nization, and do not have psychotic features. In addition,\\nbecause hypomanic episodes are characterized by high\\nenergy and goal directed activities and often result in a\\npositive outcome, or are perceived in a positive manner\\nby the patient, bipolar II disorder can go undiagnosed.\\nIn late 2001, a study reported at an international\\npsychiatric conference that impulsivity remains a key\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 229\\nBipolar disorder\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 229'),\n",

Manic episodes in these age groups\\ntypically are characterized by more psychotic features\\nthan in adults, which may lead to a misdiagnosis of schiz-\\nophrenia. Children and adolescents also tend toward irri-\\ntability and aggressiveness instead of elation. Further,\\nsymptoms tend to be chronic, or ongoing, rather than\\nacute, or episodic. Bipolar children are easily distracted,\\nimpulsive, and hyperactive, which can lead to a misdiag-\\nnosis of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n(ADHD). Furthermore, their aggression often leads to vio-\\nlence, which may be misdiagnosed as a conduct disorder.\\nSubstance abuse, thyroid disease, and use of pre-\\nscription or over-the-counter medication can mask or\\nmimic the presence of bipolar disorder. In cases of sub-\\nstance abuse, the patient must ordinarily undergo a peri-\\nod of detoxification and abstinence before a mood dis-\\norder is diagnosed and treatment begins.\\nTreatment\\nAlternative treatments for bipolar disorder generally\\nare considered to be complementary treatments to con-\\nventional therapies. General recommendations for con-\\ntrolling bipolar symptoms include maintaining a calm\\nenvironment, avoiding overstimulation, getting plenty of\\nrest, regular exercise , and proper diet. Psychotherapy\\nand counseling are generally recommended treatments\\nfor the disease, whether treated alternatively or allopathi-\\ncally. Psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral thera-\\npy, can be a useful tool in helping patients and their fam-\\nilies adjust to the disorder and in reducing the risk of sui-\\ncide. Also, educational counseling is recommended for\\nthe patient and family. In fact, a 2003 report revealed that\\npeople on medication for bipolar disorder have better re-\\nsults if they also participate in family-focused therapy.\\nChinese herbs also may help to soften mood swings.\\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remedies are pre-\\nscribed based on the patient’s overall constitution and the\\npresentation of symptoms. These remedies can stabilize\\nmoods, not just treat swings in mood. A TCM practitioner\\nmight recommend a mixture called the Iron Filings Com-\\nbination (which includes the Chinese herbs asparagus,\\nophiopogon, fritillaria, arisaema, orange peel, polygala,\\nacorus, forsythia, hoelen, fu-shen, scrophularia, uncaria\\nstem, salvia, and iron filings) to treat certain types of\\nmania in the bipolar patient. There are other formulas for\\ndepression. A trained practitioner should guide all of these\\nremedies. Compliance can be better with natural remedies\\nif they work. These remedies do not flatten moods and\\npeople in manic states do not like to be suppressed.\\nAcupuncture can be used for treatment to help\\nmaintain a more even temperament.\\nBiofeedback is effective in helping some patients\\ncontrol symptoms such as irritability, poor self control,\\nracing thoughts, and sleep problems. A diet low in vana-\\ndium (a mineral found in meats and other foods) and\\nhigh in vitamin C may be helpful in reducing depression.\\nIn 2003, a report stated that rhythm therapy, or sim-\\nply taking steps to go to bed and wake up at consistent\\ntimes each day, helps some people with bipolar disorder\\nmaintain mood stability, especially when faced with psy-\\nchosocial stress.\\nRecommended herbal remedies to ease depressive\\nepisodes may include damiana (Turnera diffusa ), gin-\\nseng (Panax ginseng), kola (Cola nitida ), lady’s slipper\\n(Cypripedium calceolus), lavender (Lavandula angusti-\\nfolia), lime blossom ( Tilia x vulgaris ), oats ( Avena\\nsativa), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis ), skullcap\\n(Scutellaria laterifolia ), St. John’s wort (Hypericum\\nperforatum ), valerian (Valeriana officinalis ), and ver-\\nvain (Verbena officinalis).\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAllopathic treatment of bipolar disorder is usually\\nby means of medication. A combination of mood stabi-\\nlizing agents with antidepressants, antipsychotics, and\\nanticonvulsants is used to regulate manic and depressive\\nepisodes.\\nMood stabilizing agents such as lithium, carba-\\nmazepine, and valproate are prescribed to regulate the\\nmanic highs and lows of bipolar disorder:\\n• Lithium (Cibalith-S, Eskalith, Lithane, Lithobid,\\nLithonate, Lithotabs) is one of the oldest and most fre-\\nquently prescribed drugs available for the treatment of\\nbipolar mania and depression. Lithium has also been\\nshown to be effective in regulating bipolar depression, but\\nis not recommended for mixed mania. Possible side ef-\\nfects of the drug include weight gain, thirst,nausea and\\nhand tremors. Prolonged lithium use may also cause hy-\\nperthyroidism(a disease of the thryoid that is marked by\\nheart palpitations, nervousness, the presence of goiter,\\nsweating, and a wide array of other symptoms).\\n• Carbamazepine (Tegretol, Atretol) is an anticonvulsant\\ndrug usually prescribed in conjunction with other mood\\nstabilizing agents. The drug is often used to treat bipo-\\nlar patients who have not responded well to lithium\\ntherapy. Blurred vision and abnormal eye movement\\nare two possible side effects of carbamazepine therapy.\\n• Valproate (divalproex sodium, or Depakote; valproic\\nacid, or Depakene) is one of the few drugs available that\\nhas been proven effective in treating rapid cycling bipo-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2230\\nBipolar disorder\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 230'),\n",

Valproate is prescribed\\nalone or in combination with carbamazepine and/or\\nlithium. Stomach cramps,indigestion, diarrhea, hair\\nloss, appetite loss, nausea, and unusual weight loss or\\ngain are some of the common side effects of valproate.\\nBecause antidepressants may stimulate manic\\nepisodes in some bipolar patients, their use is typically\\nshort-term. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\\n(SSRIs) or, less often, monoamine oxidase inhibitors\\n(MAOIs) are prescribed for episodes of bipolar depres-\\nsion. Tricyclic antidepressants used to treat unipolar de-\\npression may trigger rapid cycling in bipolar patients and\\nare, therefore, not a preferred treatment option for bipo-\\nlar depression.\\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT), has a high success\\nrate for treating both unipolar and bipolar depression,\\nand mania. However, because of the convenience of drug\\ntreatment and the stigma sometimes attached to ECT\\ntherapy, ECT usually is employed after all pharmaceuti-\\ncal treatment options have been explored. ECT is given\\nunder anesthesia and patients are given a muscle relaxant\\nmedication to prevent convulsions. The treatment con-\\nsists of a series of electrical pulses that move into the\\nbrain through electrodes on the patient’s head. Although\\nthe exact mechanisms behind the success of ECT thera-\\npy are not known, it is believed that this electrical cur-\\nrent alters the electrochemical processes of the brain,\\nconsequently relieving depression. In bipolar patients,\\nECT often is used in conjunction with drug therapy.\\nLong-acting benzodiazepines such as clonazepam\\n(Klonapin) and alprazolam (Xanax) are used for rapid\\ntreatment of manic symptoms to calm and sedate pa-\\ntients until mania or hypomania have waned and mood\\nstabilizing agents can take effect. Neuroleptics such as\\nchlorpromazine (Thorazine) and haloperidol (Haldol)\\nalso are used to control mania while a mood stabilizer\\nsuch as lithium or valproate takes effect. Clozapine\\n(Clozaril) is an atypical antipsychotic medication used to\\ncontrol manic episodes in patients who have not re-\\nsponded to typical mood stabilizing agents. The drug\\nalso has been a useful prophylactic, or preventative treat-\\nment, in some bipolar patients.\\nThe treatment rTMS, or repeated transcranial mag-\\nnetic stimulation, is a relatively new and still experimen-\\ntal treatment for the depressive phase of bipolar disorder.\\nIn rTMS, a large magnet is placed on the patient’s head\\nand magnetic fields of different frequency are generated\\nto stimulate the left front cortex of the brain. Unlike\\nECT, rTMS requires no anesthesia and does not induce\\nseizures.\\nExpected results\\nWhile most patients will show some positive re-\\nsponse to treatment, response varies widely, from full re-\\ncovery to a complete lack of response to all treatments,\\nalternative or allopathic. Drug therapies frequently need\\nadjustment to achieve the maximum benefit for the pa-\\ntient. Bipolar disorder is a chronic recurrent illness in\\nover 90% of those afflicted, and one that requires life-\\nlong observation and treatment after diagnosis. Patients\\nwith untreated or inadequately treated bipolar disorder\\nhave a suicide rate of 15-25% and a nine-year decrease\\nin life expectancy. With proper treatment, the life ex-\\npectancy of the bipolar patient will increase by nearly\\nseven years and work productivity increases by 10 years.\\nPrevention\\nThe ongoing medical management of bipolar disor-\\nder is critical to preventing relapse, or recurrence, of\\nmanic episodes. Even in carefully controlled treatment\\nprograms, bipolar patients may experience recurring\\nepisodes of the disorder. Patient education in the form of\\npsychotherapy or self-help groups is crucial for training\\nbipolar patients to recognize signs of mania and depres-\\nsion and to take an active part in their treatment program.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.

Bees and wasps will\\nsting to defend their nests or if they are disturbed. Fifty\\nor more people a year die in the United States after being\\nstung by bees, wasps, or fire ants. Almost all of those\\ndeaths are the result of allergic reactions.\\nThe poisonous snakes of the United States are divid-\\ned into two families, pit vipers (which include rat-\\ntlesnakes, copperheads, and cottonmouths, also called\\nwatermoccasins) and the coral snake family. Pit vipers\\nare responsible for about 99% of the poisonous snakebites\\nin the United States. Each year about 8,000 people in the\\nUnited States fall victim to a venomous snakebite. How-\\never, only about 15 of those people die. Most deaths are\\ndue to rattlesnake bites. In comparison, coral snakes are\\nresponsible for about 25 bites a year in the United States.\\nJellyfish, stingrays, sea urchins, sea anemones, bar-\\nracudas, and coral pose a threat to those who live or va-\\ncation in coastal communities. The majority of stings re-\\nceived from marine animals happen in saltwater and are\\nrarely life-threatening.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe typical animal bite results in a laceration, tear,\\npuncture, or crush injury. Cat bites are mostly found on the\\narms and hands, with deep puncture wounds that can reach\\nto muscles, tendons, and bones. Human bites result from\\nfights, sexual activity, and seizures. They may also be due\\nto spousal or child abuse. Children often bite other chil-\\ndren, but those bites are hardly ever severe. Human bites\\nare capable of transmitting a wide range of dangerous dis-\\neases, including hepatitisB, syphilis, and tuberculosis.\\nPeople do not always feel a spider bite. In most\\ncases, spider bites produce only minor symptoms. The\\nfirst, and possibly only, evidence of a bite may be a mild\\nswelling of the injured area and puncture marks or blis-\\nters. The affected area may be painful, itchy, or discol-\\nored. With more serious bites, there may be severe mus-\\ncle cramps and rigidity of the abdominal muscles shortly\\nafter being bitten. Other possible symptoms include ex-\\ncessive sweating,nausea, vomiting , headaches, fever,\\nchills, edema, and dizziness , as well as problems with\\nbreathing, vision, and speech. In addition, a brown spi-\\nder’s bite can lead to necrotic arachnidism, in which the\\ntissue around the bite dies. This can produce an open\\nsore that that can take years to heal completely. The\\nsymptoms of bee and wasp stings include pain, redness,\\nswelling, and itchiness at the area of the sting. Multiple\\nstings can have much more severe consequences. The\\ndanger signs of a severe allergic reaction, called anaphy-\\nlactic shock, need immediate medical attention. They in-\\nclude nausea, chest pain, abdominal cramps,diarrhea ,\\nand difficulty swallowing or breathing.\\nVenomous pit viper bites usually begin to swell with-\\nin 10 minutes and sometimes are painful. Other symptoms\\ninclude edema at the wound site, skin blisters and discol-\\noration, weakness, sweating, nausea, faintness, dizziness,\\nbruising, and tender lymph nodes. Severe poisoning can\\nlead to tingling sensations, muscle contractions, an elevat-\\ned heart rate, rapid breathing, large drops in body temper-\\nature and blood pressure, vomiting of blood, and coma.\\nCoral snake bites are painful, and the effects of the venom\\nmay include tingling at the wound site, weakness, nausea,\\nvomiting, excessive salivation, and irrational behavior.\\nNerves can become paralyzed, causing double vision, dif-\\nficulty swallowing and speaking, and respiratory prob-\\nlems. Poisonous snakes often introduce little or no venom\\ninto the victim’s body when they bite. The symptoms of\\nthese bites are not so severe. However, there is still a dan-\\nger that the wounds can become infected by harmful mi-\\ncroorganisms from the snake’s mouth.\\nJellyfish venom is delivered by barbs located on\\ntheir tentacles. These barbs can penetrate the skin of\\npeople who brush up against them, even if the jellyfish is\\ndead or the tentacle is severed from the body.

An inflammation of the connective tissue, called\\ncellulitis, may also result. Sometimes systemic, and pos-\\nsibly life-threatening,infections develop, especially\\namong those who are immunosuppressed.\\nDiagnosis\\nMost bites and stings are minor and do not need to be\\nformally diagnosed. When required, though, diagnosis re-\\nlies on a physical examination of the victim, information\\nabout the circumstances of the injury, and a look at the an-\\nimal that caused the injury, if possible. It is especially im-\\nportant to retrieve the live animal or carcass of dogs, wild\\nanimals, snakes, and spiders for assessment. Information\\nabout tetanus immunization history and possible allergies\\nto venom is important. A physical exam may be required\\nto assess damage caused by deep puncture wounds or se-\\nvere crush injuries. Chest x rays and electrocardiography\\nmay be required to assess severe symptoms. Laboratory\\ntests for identifying the microorganisms may be ordered if\\nthere is an infection. Blood and urine tests also may be\\ntaken. Testing the blood for hepatitis B and other diseases\\nis always necessary after a human bite, for example. Med-\\nical professionals should also look for indications of\\nspousal or child abuse in cases of human bites.\\nTreatment\\nSome bites and stings, such as those from venomous\\nsnakes, require immediate medical attention, as do a host\\nof others. So often, it is best to check with a medical/\\nemergency practitioner first. Also, once a patient begins\\ntreating a bite or sting with an alternative method, if\\nsigns of infection or severe allergic reaction appear, he or\\nshe should seek immediate medical help.\\nHomeopathic remedies can be useful for relieving\\nthe pain and swelling of bites and stings. If there is a pos-\\nsible allergic reaction, these remedies can be used while\\nawaiting emergency care. Aconitum can be helpful, espe-\\ncially if the person feels fearful or panicked after being\\nstung. Aconitum should be used while symptoms are in-\\ntense, and then can be followed a by another remedy, as\\nindicated. Apis mellifica is especially useful for bee\\nstings, and it can help to reduce the allergic reaction. Car-\\nbolicum acidum can also be used to treat an allergic reac-\\ntion, especially when the person feels sick and weak and\\nhas trouble breathing. Cantharis, Ledum palustre, Hyper-\\nicum, and Urtica urens are other useful remedies that\\nmay be indicated. A 6c or 12c dose of the chosen remedy\\ncan be taken every 15 minutes for up to four doses.\\nNeem, an Ayurvedan remedy, can be used to soothe\\nminor bites and stings as well as to keep insects away. A\\nthick paste can be made from neem powder blended with\\nwarm water. It can then be applied to the affected area\\ntwice daily. To prevent insect bites altogether, neem oil\\ncan be rubbed on exposed skin as a repellant. Another\\nAyurvedic remedy for soothing insect bites uses the herb\\ncilantro. One cup of the fresh leaves should be mixed\\nwith 1/3 cup of water in a blender and strained. The juice\\nshould be stored in the refrigerator, and 2 tbsp can be\\ntaken three times per day. The pulp should be saved and\\napplied directly to affected areas once or twice daily.\\nA compress made from meat tenderizer that contains\\neither papain or bromelainbreaks down the venom of bites\\nand stings. This is because most venom is protein-based.\\nThe meat tenderizer functions by breaking down such pro-\\nteins, which neutralizes the venom. A thick paste can be\\nmade using warm water or rubbing alcohol and powdered\\nmeat tenderizer and then applied directly to the affected\\nareas for relief. Powdered bromelain or papain can also be\\nused. The typical home’s kitchen or medicine cabinet holds\\nquick soothers for bee and wasp stings. Bicarbonate of soda\\nor ammonia can soothe a bee sting and vinegar or lemon\\njuice have been shown to help soothe wasp stings.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nMinor animal bites can be treated at home. The\\nwound should be washed with soap and water. Applying\\npressure to the injured area with a clean towel or sterile\\nbandage can stop bleeding. Antibiotic ointment and a\\nsterile dressing can be applied to the wound if necessary.\\nAlternately, to minimize swelling and infection, ice can\\nbe applied to the wound. Bites that do not stop bleeding\\nafter 15 minutes with pressure should be seen by a med-\\nical professional. Medical attention may also be required\\nif there are signs of infection. People who have been bit-\\nten by a cat or by a human should always see a doctor.\\nThe same is true for snake bites; bites that are deep or\\ngaping; bites to the head, hands, or feet; and bites that\\nmay be in conjunction with broken bones, damaged\\nnerves, or any other major injury. If an unfamiliar animal\\nbites, especially for no apparent reason, rabies may be\\nsuspected. A physician should be consulted. Dogs, rac-\\ncoons, skunks, bats, coyotes, foxes, and ground hogs\\noften carry rabies. In cases of suspected rabies, the victim\\nwill be given several injections with rabies vaccine. Dia-\\nbetics,AIDS patients, cancer patients, people who have\\nnot had a tetanus shot in five years, and anyone else who\\nhas increased susceptibility to infection should also seek\\nmedical treatment for all bites and serious sting wounds.\\nMedical treatment may require the removal of dead\\nand damaged tissue.

Antibiotics are usually limited to pa-\\ntients whose injuries or other health problems make them\\nlikely candidates for infection. Cat bites and human bites,\\nhowever, are usually treated with antibiotics. The patient\\nmay also require immunization against hepatitis B and\\nother diseases. A follow-up visit could be required.\\nAn ice pack should be applied to the area of a spider\\nbite as soon as it is discovered. Treatment for a serious\\nspider bite may involve the administering of muscle re-\\nlaxants, antihistamines, antibiotics, pain medication, and\\npossibly a tetanus shot. Areas of necrosis may need de-\\nbridement and skin grafts. An antivenin is available, but\\nit is not necessary in most cases, and could possibly\\ncause unpleasant side effects.\\nMost stings can be treated at home. A stinger can be\\nscraped off the skin with a blade, fingernail, credit card, or\\nstiff piece of paper. Tweezers are not recommended, since\\nthey may actually push more venom into the wound. The\\narea should then be cleaned and covered with ice. Aspirin\\nand other painkillers, antihistamines, and calamine lotion\\nare good for reducing symptoms. People who experience\\nan allergic reaction, or who are at risk for one, should seek\\nimmediate medical attention. People who are allergic\\nshould carry emergency kits containing epinephrine to\\ncounter anaphylactic shock at all times. Ticks can be care-\\nfully removed at home using tweezers. It is important to be\\nsure that the head of the tick is not left embedded in the\\nskin. If symptoms such as fever, rash or pain develop after\\na tick bite, a physician should be consulted immediately.\\nAlthough most snakes are not poisonous, any snakebite\\nshould immediately be examined at a hospital. If there is\\ntime, the victim should wash the wound site with soap and\\nwater, and then keep the injured area still and at a level\\nlower than the heart. The injured person should not have\\nanything to eat or drink, especially alcohol, until an evalua-\\ntion and treatment is obtained. There is controversy about\\nthe use of tourniquets as well as sucking out venom. These\\nshould only be done when help is far away and by someone\\nfamiliar with first aid techniques. Minor rattlesnake bites\\ncan be successfully treated without antivenin, as can the\\nbites of copperhead and water moccasins. However, coral\\nsnake and the more dangerous rattlesnake bites require an-\\ntivenin. Other treatment measures include antibiotics to pre-\\nvent infection and a tetanus booster shot.\\nWhen dealing with bites or stings of marine animals,\\nthe victim should be kept still. Gloves should be worn\\nwhen removing stingers. The area should be washed with\\nsaltwater and then soaked in very hot water for 30-90\\nminutes to neutralize the venom. Vinegar and other sub-\\nstances are used to neutralize jellyfish barbs, which are\\nthen scraped off. A doctor will usually examine stingray\\nwounds to ensure that no pieces of the spines remain.\\nAnesthetic ointments, antihistamine creams, and steroid\\nlotions are sometimes beneficial. If the bites or stings are\\nsevere, they may require emergency care.\\nExpected results\\nMost bites and stings require little intervention, and\\nclear up in a few hours or days. Those most at risk of se-\\nvere problems with bites and stings are very young chil-\\ndren, the elderly, those who are immunosuppressed, and\\npeople who are allergic to venom. Serious bites and\\nstings require prompt treatment to ensure a favorable\\noutcome. Infected bites may require hospitalization and\\ncan be fatal if neglected. In some cases, medication and\\nsurgery may be necessary. Some snakebites may result in\\namputation, permanent deformity, or loss of function in\\nthe injured area. People who are allergic to stings may\\nexperience a severe, and occasionally fatal, reaction.\\nPrevention\\nInsect repellant can help prevent insect bites and\\nstings. Those with concentrated amounts of DEET stay\\neffective longer. Sweet-scented fragrances should be\\navoided. Wearing white or khaki-colored clothing, in-\\ncluding socks and long pants, helps protects the skin from\\nbites or stings.

This an-\\nnual of the Cucurbitaceae family is a thin, climbing vine\\nwith long, stalked leaves that flowers in July or August.\\nThe plant bears a long, cucumber-shaped fruit that hangs\\nlike a pendulum, with small bumps all over it. The plant,\\nwhich is green when it is young and yellowish-orange\\nwhen it is ripe, fruits around September or October. All\\nparts of the plant—the seeds, leaves and vines—are used\\nfor medicinal purposes, but the actual fruit of the bitter\\nmelon is most commonly used. The name of the plant’s\\ngenus, Momordica , is derived from the Latin word for\\nbite, as the seeds of the fruit are serrated and appear as if\\nthey have been chewed or bitten.\\nGeneral use\\nBitter melon is used both as a medicine and as a\\nfood. It is often added to dishes, for all parts of the plant,\\nas its name suggests, taste very bitter and add an astrin-\\ngent or sour quality to foods. Bitter melon contains a\\nprotein, MAP30, that was patented by American scien-\\ntists in 1996. These scientists stated that MAP30 is effec-\\ntive against tumors,AIDS, and other viruses. The plant\\nhas been used around the world, from native healers in\\nthe Amazon to Ayurvedic doctors in India, to treat dia-\\nbetes as it is a natural hypoglycemic. In India, the plant\\nis also used in treating hemorrhoids, abdominal discom-\\nfort, fever, warm infections, and skin diseases.\\nDiabetes\\nBitter melon has been used to treat diabetes melli-\\ntus.

The name\\ncontribute to bitter melon’s hypoglycemic effects. In the\\nAmazon, the juice of the fruit is used, either alone or in\\nconjunction with a leaf decoction, to treat diabetes. In\\nIndia, where the plant is called kalara, the leaves are\\nground up, the juice is extracted, and the extract taken\\nearly in the morning for 15 days.\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\\nThe alpha- and beta-momorchardin proteins con-\\ntained in bitter melon have an inhibiting effect on human\\nimmunodefiency virus (HIV) infection, according to a\\ntest-tube study published in the Journal of Naturopathic\\nMedicine . Bitter melon can be used alone for the treat-\\nment of HIV , but it has also been used in combination\\nwith other AIDS treatments.\\nHerpes\\nTrue to its antiviral properties, the MAP30 found in\\nbitter melon can also be used by patients with herpes. In\\na 1982 study of the effects of bitter melon on the herpes\\nsimplex virus-1 (HSV-1), MAP30 inhibited the repro-\\nduction of the virus, as well as reducing its ability to\\nform plaques (patches of irritated skin).\\nPsoriasis\\nBitter melon inhibits the activity of guanylate cy-\\nclase, an enzyme that is involved in psoriasis.\\nSkin conditions\\nPractitioners of Ayurvedic medicine have used bit-\\nter melon as a treatment for skin diseases, especially sca-\\nbies. The juice is extracted from the leaf and applied ex-\\nternally to the affected area. In traditional Chinese\\nmedicine, bitter melon is used to treat dry coughs, bron-\\nchitis, and throat problems. The seeds are used topically\\nfor skin swellings caused by sprains and fractures, and\\nfor sores that are slow to heal.\\nPreparations\\nPatients who do not mind the extremely bitter taste\\ncan eat a small melon. Otherwise, up to 50 ml of fresh\\nbitter melon juice can be taken once a day. Patients who\\ndo not want the bitterness of the fresh fruit or fresh fruit\\njuice can take a fresh fruit tincture in 5 ml doses two or\\nthree times per day.\\nPrecautions\\nBitter melon is an abortifacient, so it should not be\\ntaken by women who are pregnant or nursing. It is also a\\nmedicinal herb that should not be given to small children\\nand infants due to its hypoglycemic effects.

Both traditional Chinese and Indi-\\nan Ayurvedic medicine regard the action of bitters as\\ndrying. Bitters are also antibacterial, cleansing, detoxify-\\ning, germicidal, parasiticidal, stimulating, and tonifying.\\nWhile the Chinese and Ayurvedic systems of medi-\\ncine were familiar with bitters as far back as 5,000 years,\\ntwo more recent paths of historical rediscovery and de-\\nvelopment have contributed substantially to promoting\\nthe benefits of bitters. Chronologically, the first of these\\ninvolves one of the fathers of Western medicine, also re-\\ngarded as “the father of chemistry,” the Swiss physician\\nParacelsus, (1493–1541). Paracelsus is credited with the\\nbeginnings of a formula still in use. His development of\\nthe formula may have benefited from Marco Polo’s trav-\\nels to China, the opening of the trading route from China\\nknown as The Silk Road, and the distribution of com-\\nmerce through the Venetian trading empire.\\nA quarter of a century later, the Swedish naturalist\\nand healer, Jonathan Samst, resurrected his family’s tra-\\nditional formula called elixir ad longam vitam (elixir for\\na long life), traceable to the formula of Paracelsus. This\\nmainly European development also branched out to in-\\nclude monasteries, such as the Benedictines, and several\\nEuropean families involved in trade, organized as “Hous-\\nes.” As a result, several Italian, French, and German orig-\\ninal bitter herb beverages are commercially available.\\nThe second discovery tradition begins with a Ger-\\nman medical doctor, Johann Gottlieb Benjamin Siegert,\\nwho in 1820 left Germany to join the South American\\nrevolutionary, Simon Bolivar, in winning independence\\nfrom Spain. Siegert was appointed surgeon general at the\\nmilitary hospital in a trading port town at the mouth of\\nthe Orinoco River. The name of this port town, Angostu-\\nra, is likely familiar to bartenders and gin drinkers. Dr.\\nSiegert, scientifically seeking a more effective means of\\ntreating the many wounded who also suffered from fever\\nand internal stomach disorders, spent more than four\\nyears researching the properties and qualities of local\\nplants and herbs that might be useful to his cause. In\\n1824, Dr. Siegert, with his privately developed formula\\ncalled Amargo Aromatico (aromatic bitter) used by his\\npatients, family and friends, unwittingly initiated what is\\ntoday The House of Angostur. This is an industry located\\non 20 acres in Trinidad, with worldwide distribution.\\nBitters include, but are not limited to:\\n• gentian root (Gentiana spp.)\\n• aloe (Aloe vera syn.

V olatile oils evapo-\\nrate quickly, and have distinctive aromas, forming the\\nchemical basis of aromatherapy. Three well-known foods\\nwith bitter principles that demonstrate the aromatic charac-\\nteristic in bitters are coffee, chocolate, and stout beer. Al-\\nthough purveyors and consumers may mask the bitter taste\\nwith milk, sugar, or other additives, the bitter action of\\nstimulation of the digestive system remains, and is appreci-\\nated by many. In addition to volatile oils, the bitters contain\\na wide variety of active chemical components, including:\\n• furocoumarins, also in celery, which stimulate gastric\\njuice secretion and relax the muscles\\n• complex sugars (complex carbohydrates), which have\\nantiviral and anti-inflammatory effects\\n• furanosesquiterpenes (a fat in edible oils), with possi-\\nble antiseptic activity\\n• anthraquinones, which have an irritant laxative effect\\n• alkaloids (in chocolate, mildly) with antispasmodic, an-\\ntibacterial, and pain relieving effects\\n• other vitamins, minerals, and compounds, some that\\nhave demonstrated anticancer effects\\nGeneral use\\nFor several hundred to several thousand years, the\\nchief medicinal and culinary use of bitter herbs has been\\nto stimulate digestion and improve elimination.

Another widely found precaution is avoid-\\nance of bitters by persons who have diseases of the gall\\nbladder or the biliary ducts,irritable bowel syndrome\\n(IBS), Crohn’s disease , or other digestive disorders.\\nSome precautions also exist for avoidance if one has kid-\\nney disease. Since bitters are known to be drying, cau-\\ntion is also advised regarding dehydration, and avoid-\\nance of the simultaneous use or overuse of alcohol prod-\\nucts, which are also known to be drying.\\nSide effects\\nIn general, bitters may cause dehydration in children,\\nand uterine bleeding and miscarriage in women. Individ-\\nual ingredients may also produce undesirable side effects.\\nFor example, angelica root may cause hormonal imbal-\\nances in children. It may also cause skin sensitivities, es-\\npecially for persons with psoriasis, when used with pro-\\nlonged exposure to sunlight. Senna may cause severe ab-\\ndominal cramping. Both angelica root and senna are the\\nherbs found in a noted bitter herb tonic. One source ad-\\nvises the universal precaution of paying particular atten-\\ntion to dizziness , nausea, or skin rashes, especially if\\nthey occur within several hours of taking a product.\\nTo limit or avoid side effects, sources recommend fol-\\nlowing the directions of the manufacturer, one’s health-\\ncare professional provider, and general health guidelines.\\nInteractions\\nThe following interactions pertain to the use of bit-\\nter herb formulas.\\nHerb-alternative drug favorable interactions\\nFormulas using dandelion root and leaf as part of the\\ntreatment for liver or gall bladder disease, are reported to\\nbe facilitated by supplements that contain methionine ,\\ncholine and inositol, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC).

In summer, white flowers de-\\nvelop from what are called racemes. These flowers emit\\na stinky odor. The plant, which can grow to 9 ft (1 m)\\ntall, is a native North American plant found on hills and\\nin forests located at high levels. It is found from On-\\ntario, Canada to Maine to the southern states of Georgia\\nand Missouri.\\nBlack cohosh contains several components, as out-\\nlined by James F. Balch, MD and Phyllis A. Balch, CNC\\nin their book Prescription for Nutritional Healing, Sec-\\nond Edition:\\n• actaeine\\n• cimicifugin\\n• estrogenic substances\\n• isoferulic acid\\n• oleic acid\\n• palmitic acid\\n• pantothenic acid\\n• phosphorus\\n• racemosin\\n• tannins\\n• triterpenes\\n• vitamin A\\nGeneral use\\nBlack cohosh has a history of usage for women’s\\nhealth problems, dating back to the Algonquian natives\\nliving in the Ohio Valley. However, according to Michael\\nCastleman in The Healing Herbs , the Algonquians also\\nboiled the roots in water and drank the concoction for fa-\\ntigue, arthritis, sore throat, and a typical occurrence of\\nthat time, rattlesnake bites. The Eclectic doctors of the\\n1800s also recommended black cohosh for what they\\ncalled “hysterical” diseases, i.e. female reproductive dis-\\neases as well as fevers,rashes, sleeplessness and malar-\\nia. A popular patent medicine company of the same era,\\nthe Lydia E. Pinkham’s Vegetable Compound, sold a po-\\ntion containing black cohosh for menstrual complaints.\\nToday, black cohosh is still used for gynecological\\nproblems from menstruation to menopause, with sever-\\nal studies over the past 40 years backing up this pattern\\nof usage. Michael T. Murray, ND, a well-known natural\\nmedicine author, outlines some of this research regarding\\nmenopause in his paper Hormone Replacement Therapy\\nvs. Black Cohosh in Menopause. Growing numbers of\\nmenopausal women are turning to black cohosh rather\\nthan allopathic treatment to manage their symptoms. A\\n2002 study of menopausal women in the San Francisco\\nBay area found that women taking black cohosh and\\nother herbal remedies for their symptoms reported high-\\ner satisfaction with their treatment than women receiving\\nconventional allopathic therapy.\\nThe most famous research was a 1982 open study in\\nwhich 629 women took 80 mg of black cohosh over a\\nperiod of six to eight weeks. Over 80% of the women ex-\\nperienced relief from several menopausal symptoms—\\nhot flashes, perspiration, headaches, vertigo, heart palpi-\\ntations, irritability, sleep disturbances and depression. A\\nlater random study focused on 60 women under 40 years\\nof age who had hysterectomies, with one ovary remain-\\ning. The women were either given black cohosh or hor-\\nmone replacement therapy (HRT) of estrogen or estro-\\ngen-progestin combinations. Although the HRT met with\\nbetter results, the study concluded that black cohosh was\\na favorable natural alternative for post hysterectomy.\\nA 1998 German clinical study showed that black co-\\nhosh has good therapeutic results in treating symptoms\\nof menopause and also that black cohosh did not show\\nany hormone-like activity as previously thought. A sec-\\nond German study, published in 2002, reported that\\nblack cohosh has antiestrogenic effects.\\nBecause the collective results of a number of studies\\nshow synthetic hormone replacement therapy, which con-\\ntains estrogen, increases breast cancer risk by 1–30%,\\nblack cohosh is being considered as an alternative. A 1998\\nstudy at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut re-\\nviewed eight previous studies of black cohosh as treatment\\nfor menopausal symptoms. This study stated that black co-\\nhosh is a safe alternative to estrogen replacement therapy\\n(ERT) for women where ERT is contraindicated or de-\\nclined. Some contraindicated conditions from ERT include\\na history of estrogen-dependent cancer, unidentified uterine\\nbleeding, liver disease, gallbladder disease,endometriosis,\\nuterine fibroidsand fibrocystic breast disease.\\nIn a 1999 in vitro study at the New York College of\\nOsteopathic Medicine, several herbs, including black co-\\nhosh,hops, and vitex, were shown to inhibit the growth\\nof T-47D cells. The study concluded that these herbs\\nmay be useful in preventing breast cancer.\\nA 1999-2000 study at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los\\nAngeles, California, focused on the efficacy and safety\\nof several traditional phytomedicines, including black\\ncohosh root extract, to treat women’s gynecological con-\\nditions, such as PMS and menopause.

After\\nit cools, it can be sipped with lemon and honey to mask\\nits bitter taste.\\nOne teaspoon of black cohosh tincture can be taken\\non a daily basis. Ten to 30 drops of extract mixed in\\nwater can be taken daily. Two to five capsules (40\\nmg/capsule) may be taken daily. The German Commis-\\nsion E recommends taking two 20-mg capsules daily,\\none in the morning and one at night. These tablets are\\navailable under the name Remifemin, a black cohosh ex-\\ntract. A 2002 German study found that these standard\\nhosh showed efficacy. The study stated that information\\nregarding safety for use during pregnancy and lactation\\nis still small in amount and suggested pharmacists study\\nscientific literature to help decide the value of recom-\\nmending these herbs for use.\\nA 1999 national survey of 500 midwives belonging to\\nthe American College of Nurse-Midwives and 48 nurse-\\nmidwife education programs was undertaken by the West\\nVirginia University School of Medicine. The purpose was\\nto determine if colleges were educating their students in\\nthe use of herbs to stimulate labor. Of the 172 surveys re-\\nturned, 90 used herbal preparations and 82 did not. Herbal\\nusage was broken down as: black cohosh (45%),evening\\nprimrose oil (60%), blue cohosh (64%), and castor oil\\n(93%).

Black cumin seed (also called black\\nseed) should not be confused with the herb, cumin (Cu-\\nmunum cyminum, which is found in many grocery stores.\\nConsidered native to the Mediterranean region,\\nblack cumin seed is cultivated in North Africa, Asia, and\\nsoutheastern Europe. The largest producers of black\\ncumin seed are Egypt, India, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, and\\nTurkey. Other species, such as Turkish black cumin\\n(Nigella damascena ), are not used medicinally; and one\\ntype, Nigella garidella, is even poisonous.\\nPlayfully referred to as “Love in the Mist,” the black\\ncumin seed plant has leaves that grow in pairs.

The stalk of the plant, with its\\nbluish white flower petals, can grow up to 18 inches (46\\ncm) in height while its fruit matures. At first, the seeds\\n(the fruit of the plant) are held in a capsule in the center\\nof the flower. The capsule opens upon maturity, reveal-\\ning lightly colored seeds. It is only upon their exposure\\nto air that the seeds become black.\\nMost often, the extract is produced by a process re-\\nferred to as cold pressing. Temperatures no higher than\\n140–176°F (60–80°C) are applied to the seeds to help re-\\nlease the oil and preserve its benefits.\\nRich with compounds such as nigellone and thymo-\\nquinone, black cumin seed is thought to contain over 100\\ningredients; many remain unknown. However, experts\\nagree that the most important compounds contained in\\nthe extract are the fatty acids and nutrients. Some com-\\nponents of black cumin seed extract are as follows:\\n• myristic acid\\n• palmitic acid\\n• palmitoleic acid\\n• stearic acid\\n• oleic acid\\n• linoleic acid (omega-6)\\n• linolenic acid (omega-3)\\n• arachidonic acid\\n• protein\\n• thiamin\\n• riboflavin\\n• pyridoxine\\n• niacin\\n• folacin\\n• calcium\\n• iron\\n• copper\\n• zinc\\n• phosphorous\\nGeneral use\\nBlack cumin seed has been used for centuries to\\ntreat respiratory and digestive problems, parasites, and\\ninflammation. In ancient times, it was a remedy for a va-\\nriety of health conditions including, colds,infections ,\\nheadaches, and toothaches. The pharoahs’ personal doc-\\ntors are reported to have offered black cumin seed as a\\ndigestive aid after large meals. In fact, the extract was\\nfound in the tomb of King Tutankhamun, presumably to\\nprotect him in the afterlife.\\nBlack cumin was also used as a remedy for skin dis-\\neases, dry skin, dandruff, and wounds.\\nAt one time, black cumin seed was highly valued in\\nEurope, but by the eighteenth century it had lost popular-\\nity, and was primarily used as a garden decoration. How-\\never, black cumin seed extract has regained popularity,\\nand is now more widely used as a remedy in Europe and\\nNorth America.\\nMany herbalists in current times embrace the heal-\\ning properties of black cumin seed extract. For example,\\nthe extract is sometimes used externally to treat such\\nskin care problems as psoriasis , eczema, and dry skin,\\nand internally to treat stomach problems, respiratory ail-\\nments, and allergies , as well as to improve circulation\\nand the immune system. In recent years, the extract has\\nbeen the subject of immune system research.\\nOne reason that is often given for the medicinal\\nvalue of black cumin seed extract is its richness in\\npolyunsaturated fatty acids, which help to produce\\nprostaglandin E1. Prostaglandin E1 has many functions\\nin the body, particularly in relation to the immune sys-\\ntem, sugar metabolism, skin infections, and blood clots.\\nIt is also believed to protect the stomach lining.\\nExperts point out that the medicinal value may be\\nprovided by a unique and mysterious synergy (combined\\naction) between the multitude of compounds present in\\nthe seeds. In addition, the extract, which is more concen-\\ntrated than the seeds alone, is said to have greater heal-\\ning power. A study at Cairo University in Eqypt showed\\na boost in antibacterial activity when the extract was\\nused in combination with antibiotics such as strepto-\\nmycin and gentamicin. In the same study, it showed ad-\\nditional antibacterial function in combination with ery-\\nthromycin, tobramycin, doxycycline, and ampicillin, to\\nkill E. Coli and the pathogenic yeast, Candida albicans.\\nIn addition, the study showed that the extract destroyed\\nnon-fatal subcutaneous staphylococcal infection in mice.\\nIn 2003, one study noted the antifungal activity of\\nblack cumin seed extract against Candida albicans. In the\\nstudy, mice were injected with Candida albicans, produc-\\ning colonies of the organism in their liver, spleen, and\\nkidneys. The researchers found that treatment with black\\ncumin seed extract 24 hours after inoculation inhibited\\ngrowth of the Candida albicans . With continued treat-\\nment, the extract significantly decreased the amount of\\nCandida albicansfound in the kidneys, liver, and spleen.\\nAside from verifying its antibacterial and antifungal\\nproperties, researchers in recent years have tested the\\nanti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of black cumin\\nseed extract. In 1995, a group of scientists from the De-\\npartment of Pharmacy at King’s College in London\\nfound that the extract contains these properties, and is an\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 245'),\n",

They believe the anti-inflammatory\\nand antioxidant abilities may be linked to ingredients\\nsuch as thymoquinone and unsaturated fatty acids. Ulti-\\nmately, the researchers concluded that black cumin seed\\nextract is a justified treatment for rheumatism and related\\ninflammatory diseases.\\nIn 2001, a study performed at the Department of\\nPharmacology at King Faisal University in Saudi Arabia,\\nreported anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity from\\nthe use of black cumin seed extract in animals. Paw\\nedema(swelling) was reduced, as was reaction time in\\nresponse to extreme heat. A 2003 study confirmed the\\nanalgesic effects of the extract. Studies in this area are\\nlikely to continue well into the future.\\nResearchers have also investigated and verified the\\nextract’s antihistamine activity, focusing on nigellone, an\\ningredient in black cumin seed extract. One 1993 study\\nfound that nigellone acted as an inhibitory agent on hista-\\nmine (a substance involved in an allergic response, caus-\\ning widening of blood vessels and tightening of bronchial\\npassages) by inhibiting protein kinase C, known to initi-\\nate histamine release. In 2003, another study concluded\\nthat black seed oil is an effective treatment for allergies.\\nPreparations\\nThere are many applications made with black cumin\\nseed extract. It can be found in teas, cough syrups,\\nwound salves, compresses, massage oils, and other prod-\\nucts. Black seed honey, soap, shampoo, and creams are\\nall available commercially.\\nThe extract has a strong flavor, which is improved\\nby mixing it with honey. Herbal teas also help dilute its\\nstrength. As with any product used for medicinal purpos-\\nes, it is important to read and follow the label instruc-\\ntions and warnings.\\nAlthough black cumin seed extract is not normally\\nassociated with severe skin irritation, a skin patch test\\nshould be conducted before using it for the first time. A\\nsmall amount of diluted extract is placed on the inside of\\none elbow and covered with a bandage. After 24 hours,\\nany redness or irritation is indicative of a negative reac-\\ntion. This test should be done before a person proceeds\\nwith more extensive use.\\nBlack cumin seed extract, in these dosages, is used\\nas a remedy for the following conditions:\\n• Headache. A few drops of the diluted extract are\\nrubbed on the patient’s forehead. Some patients may\\nalso find it helpful to take 1/2 teaspoon of the extract\\nafter breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\\n• Cough. The dose is 1/2 teaspoon of diluted black cumin\\nseed extract in the morning. A dry cough may require\\none teaspoon of the extract twice a day, mixed with one\\ncup of coffee or hot tea. The extract can be rubbed on\\nthe chest and back for additional relief.\\n• Common cold. One teaspoon of the extract is mixed\\nwith hot lemon tea and honey two or three times a day.\\n• Diarrhea. One teaspoon of extract is mixed with one\\ncup of yogurt twice a day.\\nPrecautions\\nBlack cumin seed extract is not to be used during\\npregnancy.\\nIts safety in young children has not been established.\\nPatients with liver or kidney disease are advised not to\\nuse this product unless a physician directs them to do so.\\nBlack cumin seed extract is said to lower blood\\nsugar levels; therefore, a diabetic patient is advised to\\nconsult with a physician before using.\\nSide effects\\nIn general, if used as directed, black cumin seed ex-\\ntract is not associated with serious side effects. However,\\nit has been reported that black cumin seed extract has a\\nvery low degree of toxicity, and may cause significant\\nnegative effects on liver and kidney function. A recom-\\nmended daily allowance (RDA) has not been established\\nfor the extract, so it is wise to consult with a physician\\nbefore beginning any internal treatment.\\nInteractions\\nThere does not appear to be a list of serious interac-\\ntions associated with the use of black cumin seed extract;\\nhowever, it is recommended that anyone taking prescrip-\\ntion drugs seek the opinion of a physician and/or phar-\\nmacist before using black cumin seed extract in combi-\\nnation with the prescribed treatment.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLuetjohann, S.

Though all parts of the\\nshrub are used—berries, bark, leaves, and seeds—it is the\\noil of the seed that is used most commonly today. Black\\ncurrant seed oil is rich in essential fatty acids , which\\npromote and maintain the body’s vital functions. Essen-\\ntial fatty acids provide energy, regulate body temperature\\nand metabolism, protect tissues, and insulate nerves. Ap-\\nproximately 17% of black currant seed oil consists of an\\nomega-6 fatty acid, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). Anoth-\\ner 13% consists of an omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic\\nacid. Evening primrose oil is primarily used for its es-\\nsential fatty acid content, but it contains only about 8%\\ngamma-linolenic acid, half of what is found in black cur-\\nrant seed oil. Because both omega-6 and omega-3 acids\\nare needed in our diets, a supplement of black currant\\nseed oil is beneficial. These essential fatty acids are bro-\\nken down by the body into prostaglandins, the body’s\\nregulating substances that block pain and govern many\\nother physical functions, especially in proper functioning\\nof the circulatory system.\\nGeneral use\\nBecause black currant seed oil is so high in gamma-\\nlinolenic acid, which makes prostaglandins, it is a highly\\neffective anti-inflammatory herb. The oil is best used for\\nchronic inflammatory conditions, cramps, and aches. It\\nalso boosts the immune system, and helps women with\\ntheir menstrual cycles and menopause, while also easing\\ndiscomforts associated with premenstrual syndrome .\\nBlack currant seed oil is also used to treat skin disorders.\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nAs an anti-inflammatory agent, black currant seed\\noil works well in rheumatoid arthritis patients by de-\\ncreasing morning stiffness in their joints. The British\\nJournal of Rheumatology has noted that black currant\\nseed oil may be so effective in rheumatoid arthritis pa-\\ntients because of a “reduction in the secretion of the in-\\nflammatory cytokines 11-1 and TNF-alpha.” Cytokines\\nare a source of inflammation. By preventing their pro-\\nduction, black currant seed oil offers some relief.\\nCardiovascular disorders\\nBlack currant seed oil is beneficial to patients with\\ncardiovascular problems, as prostaglandins counteract\\nthe constriction of blood vessels. Two Canadian studies\\nhave also showed that omega-6 fatty acids lower blood\\npressure.\\nWomen’s health problems\\nBecause prostaglandins regulate the menstrual cycle,\\nblack currant seed oil is helpful for women before and\\nduring menstruation.

The stem bark of black haw\\nis approved for use in foods in the United States. It is na-\\ntive to the woodlands of temperate and subtropical parts of\\nNorth America, Europe, and Asia. Its other names are stag-\\nbush and American sloe. Black haw belongs to the same\\ngenus as the guelder rose Viburnum opulus which is also\\nknown as cramp bark. The two are sometimes used inter-\\nchangeably and have similar properties, but black haw is\\nmore specific in its effects on the uterus. The actions of\\nblack haw are described as antispasmodic, sedative, astrin-\\ngent, muscle relaxant, cardiotonic, uterine relaxant, and\\nanti-inflammatory.\\nGeneral use\\nBlack haw has been used traditionally for problems\\nrelated to the female reproductive tract. It acts as a gener-\\nal antispasmodic that may relax skeletal muscle as well,\\nbut is particularly effective on the uterus. As such, it is a\\npotential agent to be included in the treatment of threat-\\nened miscarriage, menstrual cramps, false labor, and the\\nafterpains of childbirth. The antispasmodic properties of\\nblack haw are also reportedly useful for colic, bladder\\nspasms, cramping pain in the bile ducts, diarrhea, and\\nheavy bleeding during menopause. Black haw may also\\nhave some ability to lower high blood pressure.\\nThe most common use of black haw is as an anti-\\nspasmodic for menstrual pain. To relax the uterus and re-\\nlieve menstrual cramping, the most commonly recom-\\nmended dose is 5 mL (1tsp) of the tincture in water,\\ntaken three to five times daily as needed. Tinctures of\\nblack haw are generally prepared by placing an ounce of\\nfresh herb in an ounce of 50% alcohol, and steeping the\\nmixture for six weeks. Alcohol may extract certain\\nchemical components of the herb more or less strongly\\nthan water does, so tinctures may exert different levels of\\nactivity than teas (generally the least strong preparations)\\nor infusions. Tinctures and other preparations of black\\nhaw are commercially available from some herbalists or\\nhealth food stores.\\nBlack haw is sometimes used to prevent chronic\\nmiscarriage. It has been similarly utilized for the condi-\\ntion of irritable uterus occurring in late pregnancy. The\\nreported nervine (nerve-calming) effect of black haw\\nmay be useful in addition to its spasmolytic properties.\\nOne recommended dose for these indications is 1–2 cups\\nof tea per day as soon as pregnancy is diagnosed.

It is native to Eastern North America, where it is\\nfound from New Brunswick south to Georgia and as far\\nwest as Kansas and Minnesota. Although chiefly valued\\nfor its decorative fine-grained wood, the tree’s bark, root,\\nleaves, and nuts all have medicinal properties. These\\nqualities are similar to those of the closely related\\nJuglans regia(better known as English walnut), the tree\\nmost commonly used by commercial walnut growers.\\nGeneral use\\nThe main active ingredients of black walnut are tan-\\nnins such as galloyglucose and ellagitannins, and juglone\\n(5-hydroxy-alphanapthaquinone). Walnut shells are very\\nrich in vitamin C , and betacarotene, B 1,B 2, and B6 are\\nfound in the leaves.\\nHerbalists use external applications of the plant for a\\nvariety of skin complaints including ringworm,jock itch,\\nathlete’s foot, psoriasis, blisters, eczema, scabbing pru-\\nritus, varicose ulcers, and even syphilis sores. The oil is a\\ntraditional hair tonic. Black walnut preparations have also\\nbeen used for eye infections and irritations of the eyelid.\\nInternally, black walnut extracts are taken for ailments\\nsuch as gout, rheumatism, glandular disturbances,worms,\\nand parasites. It is also used to stimulate the appetite and as\\na laxative. Some authors consider it a blood purifier. There\\nis evidence dating back to the 1960s showing that chemical\\ncomponents in the nut may help reduce blood pressure.\\nAn April 2000 report in the Annals of Internal Medi-\\ncine raised hope that walnuts might help reduce harmful\\nLDL cholesterol. In a study conducted by a researcher at\\nthe Hospital Clinic Provincial in Barcelona, it was report-\\ned that substituting 8-11 walnuts a day for olive oil and\\nother fatty foods in the cholesterol-lowering Mediter-\\nranean diet significantly improved the diet’s effective-\\nness. In fact, the average reduction of LDL cholesterol in\\nwalnut dieters was twice that of participants using the tra-\\nditional Mediterranean diet. However, the walnuts were\\nadded to a diet already known to be healthy, so the find-\\nings do not necessarily imply that addition of the nuts to a\\nless nutritious diet would have a similar effect.\\nThe ancient Doctrine of Signatures stated that hints\\nto the healing properties of plants could be found in their\\nphysical appearance.

Reproduced by permission.)\\nOne of the first warning signals of bladder cancer is\\nblood in the urine. Sometimes, there is enough blood to\\nchange the color of the urine to a yellow-red or a dark\\nred. However, during the early stages of bladder cancer\\nthere are often no observable symptoms of the disease. A\\nchange in bladder habits such as painful urination, in-\\ncreased frequency of urination and increased urgency in\\nthe need to urinate, are all symptoms of bladder cancer;\\nbut they are also common symptoms of less serious dis-\\neases of the urinary tract and prostate glands.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere are several tests to find out whether bladder\\ncancer is present. As a first step, a complete medical histo-\\nry will be taken to check for any risk factors. A thorough\\nphysical examination will be conducted to assess all the\\nsigns and symptoms. Laboratory testing of a urine sample\\nhelps rule out the presence of a bacterial infection.\\nMore in-depth tests are used to make a definite diag-\\nnosis. The intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is an x-ray ex-\\namination that is performed after a dye is injected into\\nthe blood stream. It clearly outlines the kidneys, ureters,\\nbladder, and urethra to detect abnormalities in the lining\\nof these organs.\\nIn a procedure known as a cystoscopy, a thin hollow\\nlighted tube is introduced into the bladder. If any suspi-\\ncious looking masses are seen, a small piece of the tissue\\ncan be removed using a pair of biopsy forceps. The tis-\\nsue is then examined microscopically to verify if cancer\\nis present. Imaging tests such as chest x rays, computed\\ntomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imag-\\ning (MRI) may be done to determine if the cancer has\\nspread to other organs.\\nTreatment\\nMost alternative treatments for cancer should be\\nused in addition to allopathic treatment. A well-devel-\\noped treatment plan for cancer should be discussed with\\nan oncologist or other physician.\\nStudies indicate that garlic may be used to stop the\\nspread of bladder cancer. It also can help reduce the\\nbody wasting and fatigue that may accompany cancer, as\\nwell as reducing the side effects of radiation and\\nchemotherapy. The equivalent of one to two cloves per\\nday is recommended.\\nEuropean mistletoe (Viscum album L. ), is recom-\\nmended to stimulate the immune system and to kill can-\\ncer cells. It also has been reported to reduce tumor size.\\nThe most widely available mistletoe extract is sold under\\nthe name of Iscador. Iscador is available in Europe only,\\nespecially Switzerland. A three-month supply can be\\ngrowth and start dividing uncontrollably. This abnormal\\ngrowth results in a mass of cells that form a tumor.\\nDescription\\nBladder cancer attacks the urinary bladder, a hollow,\\nmuscular organ that stores the urine received from the kid-\\nneys until it is excreted out of the body. Bladder cancer is\\nthe fifth most common cancer in the United States, and the\\ndevelopment of new cases is on the rise. The disease is al-\\nmost three times more common among men than women,\\nand the risk of the disease increases with age. Most cases\\nof bladder cancer are found in people in their 60s.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nSmoking is considered one of the greatest risk fac-\\ntors for bladder cancer. The risk is probably due to the\\nfact that cancer-promoting substances found in tobacco\\ntend to collect in the urine, and then become concentrat-\\ned in the bladder while awaiting excretion. Other chemi-\\ncals, including aniline dyes, beta-napthylamine, benza-\\ndine salts, and mixtures of aromatic hydrocarbons also\\nare believed to be cancer-causing agents. These chemi-\\ncals are widely used in the rubber, leather, textile, chemi-\\ncal, plastics, petroleum, wood, and paint industries. It\\nmay take up to 50 years after the original chemical expo-\\nsure for bladder cancer to develop. In 2003, studies\\nshowed that hormone replacement therapy (HRT), a\\ntreatment used by many postmenopausal women, signifi-\\ncantly increased the risk of bladder and other cancers.\\nFrequent urinary tract infections , kidney and blad-\\nder stones, and other conditions that cause long-term ir-\\nritation to the bladder may increase the risk of bladder\\ncancer. If there is a past history of tumors in the bladder,\\nthere is a strong possibility of their recurrence.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 252'),\n",

Mistle-\\ntoe often is taken in injectable form and should be ad-\\nministered under a physician’s supervision.\\nHigh doses of multivitamins have been reported to\\nbe useful in decreasing the possibility of the recurrence\\nof bladder cancer. Treatment should be monitored by a\\nqualified healthcare practitioner.\\nOther complementary and alternative treatments in-\\nclude guided imagery, local and general hyperthermia,\\nand Chinese herbs. These herbs have been shown effec-\\ntive in controlled trials, particularly as a complement to\\nchemotherapy.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment for bladder cancer depends on the stage\\nof the tumor. The standard modes of treatment available\\nfor bladder cancer are surgery, immunotherapy, radiation\\ntherapy, and chemotherapy. Surgery is considered an op-\\ntion only when the disease is in its early stages. If the\\ntumor is small and has not spread to the inner layers of\\nthe bladder, surgery can be done without cutting open\\nthe abdomen. A cystoscope is introduced into the bladder\\nthrough the urethra, and the tumor is removed through it.\\nA high-energy laser beam or other cautery instrument\\nmay be introduced through the cystoscope to burn away\\nany remaining cancer.\\nIf cancer has invaded deep into the walls of the blad-\\nder, surgery will be done through an incision in the ab-\\ndomen. Part or all of the bladder and surrounding organs\\nsuch as the prostate or the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian\\ntubes may have to be removed. If the entire urinary blad-\\nder is removed, an alternate place must be created for the\\nurine to be stored before it is excreted. To do this, the\\nureters are connected to a surgically created opening in\\nthe skin, called a stoma. This procedure is called a\\nurostomy. A procedure can create a new bladder (called a\\nneo-bladder) using the patient’s intestine.\\nRadiation therapy uses high-energy rays to kill can-\\ncer cells. It generally is used after surgery to destroy any\\ncancer cells that have not been removed during surgery.\\nIn addition, if the tumor is large or it is in a location that\\nmakes surgery difficult, radiation may be used before\\nsurgery to shrink the tumor. Radiation sometimes is used\\ntogether with chemotherapy in place of surgery. Radia-\\ntion therapy is used to ease pain, bleeding, and block-\\nages in cases of advanced bladder cancer.\\nChemotherapy uses drugs to destroy cancer cells.\\nGenerally a combination of drugs is more effective than\\nany single drug in treating bladder cancer. Medications\\nare introduced into the bloodstream by injecting them\\ninto a vein in the arm or orally in pill form. Anticancer\\ndrugs may also be introduced directly into the bladder to\\ntreat superficial tumors. Chemotherapy may be given\\nfollowing surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells.

In the study of 307 patients, those with\\nthis combination of therapy lived two years longer than\\nthose treated with surgery only.\\nImmunotherapy, or biological therapy, uses the\\nbody’s own immune system to fight the disease. In the\\ncase of early-stage bladder cancer, bacille Calmette-\\nGuerin (BCG), a weakened strain of tuberculosis ,m a y\\nbe placed directly into the bladder. As the immune sys-\\ntem rallies to fight off the tuberculosis, it also attacks and\\nkills cancer cells.

In 2003, a type of gene\\ntherapy was being tested on patients with bladder cancer\\nwith success, but further enhancements were needed.\\nExpected results\\nIf cancer is detected early and is limited to the inner\\nlining of the bladder, it responds well to treatment. Most\\nbladder cancers are first seen at this stage. At least 90%\\nof patients survive five years or more after an initial di-\\nagnosis.

Odle\\nBladder infection\\nDefinition\\nBladder infection, also called cystitis, refers to in-\\nfection and inflammation of the urinary bladder. Urethri-\\ntis is an inflammation of the urethra, which is the pas-\\nsageway that connects the bladder with the exterior of\\nthe body. Sometimes cystitis and urethritis are referred to\\ncollectively as a lower urinary tract infection, or UTI. In-\\nfection of the upper urinary tract involves the spread of\\nbacteria to the kidney and is called pyelonephritis.\\nDescription\\nThe frequency of bladder infections in humans\\nvaries significantly according to age and sex. The\\nmale/female ratio of UTIs in children younger than 12\\nmonths is 4:1 because of the high rate of birth defects in\\nthe urinary tract of male infants. In adults, the male/fe-\\nmale ratio of UTIs is 1:50. After age 50, however, the in-\\ncidence among males increases due to prostate disorders.\\nUTIs are common in females. It is estimated that\\n50% of adult women experience at least one episode of\\ndysuria (painful urination); half of these patients have a\\nbacterial UTI. Between 2-5% of women’s visits to pri-\\nmary care doctors are for UTI symptoms. About 90% of\\nUTIs in women are uncomplicated but recurrent.\\nUTIs are uncommon in younger and middle-aged\\nmen, but may occur as complications of bacterial infec-\\ntions of the kidney or prostate gland.\\nIn children, bladder infection is often caused by\\ncongenital (present at birth) abnormalities of the urinary\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2254\\nBladder infection\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nCautery instrument —A device that uses heat ap-\\nplied to the tissues to destroy damaged or dis-\\neased areas.\\nCystoscope—An instrument used to view and in-\\ntroduce treatments into the urinary tract.\\nMetastasize —The spread of cancer to an area\\naway from where it started originally.\\nOncologist—A doctor who specializes in treating\\ncancer.\\nTumor—An uncontrolled growth of tissue, which\\nmay be cancerous.\\nUreters—The tubes that carry urine from the kid-\\nney into the bladder for storage.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 254'),\n",

Vesicoureteral reflux is a condition in which the\\nchild cannot completely empty the bladder. It allows\\nurine to remain in or flow backward (reflux) into the par-\\ntially empty bladder.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe causes of bladder infection vary according to\\ngender because of the differences in anatomical structure\\nof the urinary tract.\\nFemales\\nMost bladder infections in women are so-called as-\\ncending infections, which means that they are caused by\\nmicrobes traveling upward through the urethra to the\\nbladder. The relative shortness of the female urethra\\n(1.2-2 in [3-5 cm] in length) makes it easy for bacteria to\\ngain entry to the bladder and multiply. The most com-\\nmon bacteria associated with UTIs in women include Es-\\ncherichia coli (about 80% of cases), Staphylococcus\\nsaprophyticus , Klebsiella , Enterobacter , and Proteus\\nspecies. Risk factors for UTIs in women include:\\n• Sexual intercourse. The risk of infection increases if\\nthe woman has multiple partners.\\n• Use of a diaphragm for contraception.\\n• An abnormally short urethra.\\n• Diabetes or chronic dehydration.\\n• The absence of a specific enzyme (fucosyltransferase)\\nin vaginal secretions. The lack of this enzyme makes it\\neasier for the vagina to harbor bacteria that cause UTIs.\\n• Inadequate personal hygiene. Bacteria from fecal mat-\\nter or vaginal discharge can enter the female urethra be-\\ncause its opening is very close to the vagina and anus.\\n• History of previous UTIs. About 80% of women with\\nbladder infection develop recurrences within two years.\\nThe early symptoms of bladder infection in women\\nare dysuria ( pain on urination), urgency (sudden strong\\ndesire to urinate), and increased frequency of urination.\\nAbout 50% of female patients experience fever, pain in\\nthe lower back or flanks, nausea and vomiting, or shak-\\ning chills. These symptoms indicate pyelonephritis, or\\nspread of the infection to the upper urinary tract.\\nMales\\nMost UTIs in adult males are complications of kid-\\nney or prostate infections. They usually are associated\\nwith a tumor or kidney stones that block the flow of\\nurine and often are persistent infections caused by drug-\\nresistant organisms. UTIs in men are most likely to be\\ncaused by E. coli or another gram-positive bacterium. S.\\nsaprophyticus, which is the second most common cause\\nof UTIs in women, rarely causes infections in men. The\\nsymptoms of bladder infection and pyelonephritis in\\nmen are the same as in women. Risk factors for UTIs in\\nmen include:\\n• Lack of circumcision. The foreskin can harbor bacteria\\nthat cause UTIs.\\n• Urinary catheterization. The longer the period of\\ncatheterization, the higher the risk of UTIs.\\nHemorrhagic cystitis\\nHemorrhagic cystitis, which is marked by large\\nquantities of blood in the urine, is caused by an acute\\nbacterial or viral infection of the bladder. In some cases,\\nhemorrhagic cystitis is a side effect of therapy or treat-\\nment with cyclophosphamide. Hemorrhagic cystitis in\\nchildren is associated with adenovirus type 11.

In small children, the doctor will\\ncheck for fever, abdominal masses, and a swollen bladder.\\nThe next step in diagnosis is collection of a urine\\nsample. The procedure differs somewhat for women and\\nmen. Laboratory testing of urine samples can now be\\nperformed with dipsticks that indicate immune system\\nresponses to infection, as well as with microscopic\\nanalysis of samples. Normal human urine is sterile. The\\npresence of bacteria or pus in the urine usually indicates\\ninfection. The presence of blood in the urine (hematuria)\\nmay indicate acute UTIs, kidney disease, kidney stones,\\ninflammation of the prostate (in men),endometriosis (in\\nwomen), or cancer of the urinary tract.\\nFemales\\nFemale patients sometimes require a pelvic exami-\\nnation as part of the procedure to diagnose bladder infec-\\ntions. The patient lies on an obstetrical table with feet in\\nthe stirrups. The may take a vaginal culture smear. The\\npatient often is asked to provide a urine sample. A mid-\\nstream urine sample of 200 ml is collected to test for\\nbladder infection. Often, just a “clean catch,” or mid-\\nstream sample, is needed, without a pelvic exam.\\nA high bacterial count in the urine sample indicates\\nurethritis. A count of more than 100,000 (10 5 bacteria\\nCFU/ml, or colony-forming units per milliliter) in the\\nmidstream sample indicates a bladder or kidney infec-\\ntion. A colony is a large number of microorganisms that\\ngrow from a single cell. Bacterial count can be given in\\nCFU or colony forming units.\\nMales\\nIn male patients, the doctor will cleanse the opening\\nto the urethra with an antiseptic before collecting the\\nurine sample. The first 10 ml of urine are collected sepa-\\nrately. The patient then voids a midstream sample of 200\\nml. Following the second sample, the doctor will mas-\\nsage the patient’s prostate and collect several drops of\\nprostatic fluid. The patient then voids a third urine speci-\\nmen for prostatic culture.\\nA high bacterial count in the first urine specimen or\\nthe prostatic specimen indicates urethritis or prostate in-\\nfections respectively. A bacterial count greater than\\n100,000 bacteria CFU/ml in the midstream sample sug-\\ngests a bladder or kidney infection. Children may need to\\nbe catheterized (a sterile procedure), in which case a cul-\\nture of 1,000 bactera CFU/ml is indicative of infection.\\nOther tests\\nWomen with recurrent UTIs can be given ultrasound\\ntests of the kidneys and bladder together with a voiding\\ncystourethrogram to test for structural abnormalities. (A\\ncystourethrogram is an x-ray test in which an iodine dye\\nis used to better view the urinary bladder and urethra.)\\nV oiding cystourethrograms are also used to evaluate chil-\\ndren with UTIs. In some cases, computed tomography\\nscans (CT scans) can be used to evaluate patients for\\npossible cancers or other masses in the urinary tract.\\nTreatment\\nDiet\\nDietary changes which may help to control and pre-\\nvent bladder infection include:\\n• Drinking 8–12 glasses of water daily helps to wash out\\nbacteria (although this may also dilute antibacterial fac-\\ntors in the urine).\\n• Acidifying the urine by eating few alkaline foods\\n(dairy, soda, and citrus).\\n• Following a diet rich in grains, vegetables, and acidify-\\ning juices.\\n• Eliminating foods that irritate the bladder (coffee, black\\ntea, alcohol, and chocolate).\\n• Eliminating high sugar foods (sweet vegetables, fruits,\\nsugar, and honey).\\n• Drinking unsweetened cranberry juice to acidify the\\nurine and provide hippuric acid. Cranberry capsules\\ncan substitute for the juice.\\n• Ingesting at least one clove of garlic (or up to 1,200 mg\\ngarlic as a tablet) daily for its anti-infective properties.\\nHerbals and Chinese medicine\\nHerbals that possess antibacterial, antioxidant,\\ndemulcent, astringent, antiviral, antispasmodic, and/or\\ndiuretic properties are useful in treating bladder infec-\\ntion. Herb tinctures have a more rapid effect than teas.\\nUseful herbals include bearberry (Arctostaphylos uva-\\nursi), buchu (Barosma betulina ), cornsilk (Zea mays ),\\ncinnamon, cedar, pipsissewa ( Chimaphilia ), Oregon\\ngrape root ( Berberis aquifolia ), goldenseal (Hydrastis\\ncanadensis ), marsh mallow root ( Althea officinalis ),\\nkava, and birch.

The patient can take 1.5–3 g of the\\nChinese patent medicine Qing Lin Wan (Green Unicorn\\nPill) twice daily.\\nSupplements\\nThe antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E may be benefi-\\ncial in treating bladder infection. The patient should take\\n400–600 IU of vitamin E and 300 mg vitamin B 6 daily.\\nAscorbic acid is irritating to the bladder so vitamin C\\nshould be taken in the form of calcium ascorbate, about\\n6,000-20,000 per day. Magnesiummay be helpful in treat-\\ning renal disease. Zinc may boost the immune system.\\nHomeopathic medicine also can be effective in treat-\\ning bladder infection. Choosing the correct remedy\\n(based on the patient’s symptoms) is always key to the\\nsuccess of homeopathic treatment. Homeopathic reme-\\ndies for bladder infection include Spanish fly\\n(Cantharis), sarsaparilla, stavesacre ( Staphysagria), and\\nOregon grape (Berberis aquifolium). The correct homeo-\\npathic treatment is effective within 12 hours. Acupunc-\\nture also can be helpful in treating acute and chronic\\ncases of bladder infection.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nMedications\\nUncomplicated cystitis is treated with antibiotics.\\nThese include penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin;\\nsulfisoxazole or sulfamethoxazole; trimethoprim; nitro-\\nfurantoin; cephalosporins; or fluoroquinolones. Treat-\\nment for women is short-term; most patients respond\\nwithin three days. In 2003, reports showed that pre-\\nsumed, uncomplicated UTIs in women could often be\\ntreated over the telephone when the patient reported her\\nsymptoms to a nurse who had a series of prepared ques-\\ntions. Men typically do not respond as well and require\\nseven to 10 days of oral antibiotics for uncomplicated\\nUTIs. Patients of either sex may be given phenazopyri-\\ndine or flavoxate to relieve painful urination. Trimetho-\\nprim and nitrofurantoin are preferred for treating recur-\\nrent UTIs in women.\\nOver 50% of older men with UTIs also suffer from\\ninfection of the prostate gland. Some antibiotics, includ-\\ning amoxicillin and the cephalosporins, do not affect the\\nprostate gland. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics or trimetho-\\nprim are the drugs of choice for these patients.\\nSurgery\\nA minority of women with complicated UTIs may\\nrequire surgical treatment to prevent recurrent infections.\\nSurgery is also used to treat reflux problems (movement\\nof the urine backwards) or other structural abnormalities\\nin children and anatomical abnormalities in adult males.\\nExpected outcome\\nIn many cases, alternative medicines can resolve\\nbladder infections quickly. It is important to see a doctor\\nif symptoms do not subside after a few days or worsen.\\nThe prognosis for recovery from uncomplicated bladder\\ninfection is excellent. However, complicated UTIs in\\nmales are difficult to treat because they often involve\\nbacteria that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics.\\nPrevention\\nResearchers are trying to develop a vaccine for\\nUTIs. In 2003, a study of women with frequent infec-\\ntions showed that a vaccine administered by a vaginal\\nsuppository headed off bladder infections in many of the\\nstudy volunteers. The vaccine was still not available on\\nthe market, however. The following measures may be\\ntaken to prevent bladder infection:\\n• drinking large amounts of fluid\\n• reducing intake of sugar\\n• voiding frequently and as soon as the need arises\\nWomen with two or more UTIs within a six-month\\nperiod are sometimes given prophylactic antibiotic treat-\\nment, usually nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim for three to\\nsix months. In some cases the patient is advised to take\\nan antibiotic tablet following sexual intercourse.\\nOther preventive measures for women include:\\n• voiding frequently, particularly after intercourse\\n• proper cleansing of the area around the urethra (wipe\\nfront to back)\\n• acupuncture\\nThe primary preventive measure specifically for\\nmales is prompt treatment of prostate infections. Chronic\\nprostatitis may go unnoticed but can trigger recurrent\\nUTIs. In addition, males who require temporary\\ncatheterization following surgery can be given antibi-\\notics to lower the risk of UTIs.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nAnderson, E.

The bitter-tasting,\\nprickly thistles are considered “noxious weeds” when\\nthey take root and grow abundantly in open fields and\\nmeadows. The presence of this beneficial Mediterranean\\nnative, however, indicates fertile ground. The ancient\\nRomans ate the leaf fresh and boiled the root as a veg-\\netable. Thistle was once used as a nutritious fodder for\\ncattle in Scotland, and the leaf, folded between two\\nslices of buttered bread, was eaten with the breakfast\\nmeal. In the Middle Ages, thistle was one of the most\\ncommon European medicinal herbs. Shakespeare wrote\\nabout it in his play,Much Ado About Nothing, with the\\nadvice: “Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedic-\\ntus and lay it to your heart; it is the only thing for a\\nqualm.” The belief in thistle as a heart tonic persists. One\\nEnglish herbalist, writing in the mid-twentieth century,\\ndeclared blessed thistle “Good for all organs of the body,\\nespecially the heart and brain.” Like many native Euro-\\npean herbs, blessed thistle is credited with magical pow-\\ners. It is said to be effective in exorcism, hex-breaking,\\nand in purification spells. Grown outside the home, this\\nblessed herb is said to attract peace, love, and harmony.\\nBlessed thistle is also known as holy thistle, St.\\nBenedict thistle, cardin, and spotted thistle. This herba-\\nceous annual has been cultivated for centuries as a medi-\\ncinal herb. It was a component of many herbal remedies\\nused to combat the plague. The herb was cultivated in\\nmonastery gardens as a cure for smallpox. Its specific\\nname is in honor of St. Benedict, the founder of a holy\\norder of monks.\\nOther thistles, including Carduus marianus or Sily-\\nbum marianum , also sometimes known as holy thistle,\\nOur Lady’s milk thistle , Marian thistle, and wild arti-\\nchoke have similar medicinal applications, particularly\\nas liver tonics.\\nThistles are naturalized throughout North America,\\nfound growing wild in sunny locations and stony soils.\\nBlessed thistle grows from a thick taproot first forming a\\nrosette of narrow leaves at ground level. The stems aris-\\ning from the root are erect and hairy. Dark green, narrow\\nleaves clasp the stem. They are deeply lobed, wavy and\\ntoothed on the margins, and veined. Each toothed lobe\\nbears a prickly spine. Even the pale yellow flower heads,\\nblooming at the top of the stem, are covered with prickly\\nspines. The stem is reddish brown and branched reaching\\nto two feet in length. The hardy thistle will self sow and\\nthrive in good soil. If left to grow wild and uncultivated,\\nthistles may become intrusive.\\nGeneral use\\nThe entire plant is edible, though the prickly spines\\ncan be troublesome.

Blessed thistle is\\nconsidered by many contemporary herbalists and in tra-\\nditional folk use as a tonic, astringent, diaphoretic (in-\\ncreases perspiration), emetic (induces vomiting ), and\\nstimulant. Both the blessed thistle and milk thistles are\\nrecommended as a liver tonic, particularly when the liver\\ndisease is brought on by alcoholism. It has been used in\\ntreatment of jaundice and hepatitis . A tea from the\\nleaves, taken warm, will increase perspiration, reduce\\ncongestion, and help to bring down fever. A mild infu-\\nsion is astringent and may relieve diarrhea , but a very\\nstrong infusion is emetic and may cause nausea and\\nvomiting. Blessed thistle is considered to be one of the\\nbest herbs to stimulate the flow of milk in lactating\\nwomen (lactating women should always consult their\\nphysicians before taking this herb), and its emmena-\\ngogue action (promotes menstrual discharge) helps to\\nregulate female hormone balance and relieve menstrual\\npain. Blessed thistle has also been used to treat the vagi-\\nnal discharge known as leucorrhea. The herb is used in\\nthe commercial manufacture of herbal bitters , and is\\nconsidered a general tonic and digestive. Its bitter prop-\\nerties increase the flow of bile and other gastric secre-\\ntions. The herb may stimulate appetite and relieve flatu-\\nlence. Blessed thistle is said to relieve melancholy and\\nlethargy, and was traditionally fed to mentally ill per-\\nsons. It acts to increase blood circulation and aids mem-\\nory. Applied externally in poultice form, blessed thistle\\nis a good treatment for shingles , wounds, and ulcers.\\nThe plant has antimicrobial properties. The essential oil\\nhas been shown to have antibiotic action against infec-\\ntions, specifically Staphylococcus aureus and S. faecalis.\\nBlessed thistle has a history in folk use for the treatment\\nof heart ailments, cancers, and as a contraceptive, but\\nthese, and other traditional uses, have not been con-\\nfirmed by research.\\nPreparations\\nCollect thistle on a hot and dry mid-summer after-\\nnoon, just as the herb begins to bloom. Harvest from the\\nwild in areas where herbicides are not used, or from a\\ncultivated garden patch. The leaves and flowering stems\\nmay be hung to dry in a light, airy room away from direct\\nsunlight. Cut the dried herb and store in a clearly-labeled,\\ndark-glass container. Seeds may be gathered in the fall.\\nTincture: Combine 4 oz of fresh, or half as much\\ndried, thistle leaf with 1 pt of brandy, gin, or vodka in a\\nglass container. The alcohol should be enough to cover\\nthe flowers. The ratio should be close to 50/50 alcohol to\\nwater. Stir and cover. Place the mixture in a dark cup-\\nboard for three to five weeks. Shake the mixture several\\ntimes each day. Strain and store in a tightly-capped,\\nclearly labeled, dark glass bottle. A standard dose is 1–2\\nml of the tincture three times a day. Tinctures, properly\\nprepared and stored, will retain medicinal potency for\\ntwo years or more.\\nInfusion: Use twice as much fresh, chopped herb\\nas dried herb. Steep 1–2 teaspoons of finely chopped\\nfresh or dried thistle per cup of boiled, unchlorinated\\nwater for 10–15 minutes. Strain and cover. Drink\\nwarm, sweetened with honey if desired. A standard\\ndose is three cups per day. Strong infusions of thistle\\nmay cause diarrhea. A prepared herbal infusion will\\nkeep for up to two days in the refrigerator and retain\\nits healing qualities.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are no reported incidents of thistle toxicity.\\nHowever, as with most medicinal herbs, they should not\\nbe taken during pregnancy .

A medical history, physical examination, and further\\nmedical testing may be part of the diagnostic procedure.\\nTreatment\\nUnless they are hindering movement or are extreme-\\nly painful due to their size and/or location, blisters\\nshould not be ruptured, or “popped,” as doing so can in-\\ntroduce bacteria into the wound. If a blister does burst,\\nthe extra skin should be left intact. Blisters that are ex-\\ncessively large or painful should only be punctured using\\nantiseptic procedures, preferably by or under the direc-\\ntion of a qualified healthcare professional.\\nTreatment of blisters depends on their cause. Blis-\\nters that are symptomatic of a disease or disorder require\\ntreatment of the illness itself. Blisters caused by friction\\nor trauma can be treated by cleansing with mild soap, ap-\\nplying an antiseptic, and covering the area with a sterile\\nbandage. An herbalist, aromatherapist, or holistic health-\\ncare professional may recommend a compress of an anti-\\nseptic or anti-microbial herb such as marigold (Calendu-\\nla officinalis), thyme (Thymus vulgaris ), lavender (La-\\nvandula angustifolia), or tea tree oil (Melaleuca alterni-\\nfolia).\\nThe blister should be kept clean and the bandage\\nchanged frequently.

They may be caused by an allergic\\nreaction,burns, frostbite, or by excessive friction or\\ntrauma to the skin. Blisters may also be a symptom of a\\nsystemic illness, or of a specific skin disorder.\\nDescription\\nThe thin-skinned sac of a blister contains fluid, and\\nin most cases should not be ruptured, as rupturing can in-\\ntroduce infection and slow the healing process. Blisters\\nthat contain blood instead of fluid are aptly named blood\\nblisters, and are caused by a rupture of blood vessels be-\\nneath the surface of the skin, usually due to trauma.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBlisters can be caused by a number of conditions\\nand environmental agents, including:\\n• Friction. Rubbing or pinching can cause skin irritation\\nand blistering. Friction blisters frequently occur on the\\nhands and feet.\\n• Disease. Blisters are symptomatic of skin disorders\\nsuch as impetigo , incontinentia pigmenti syndrome\\n(IPS), and pemphigus vulgaris. Blisters may also be\\ncaused by diseases such as herpes and chickenpox.\\n• Contact dermatitis. Skin contact with an allergen (e.g.,\\nlatex, cosmetics, cleaning solutions) can trigger red-\\nness, irritation, rash, and blistering of the skin.

Odle\\nBlood clots\\nDefinition\\nA blood clot is a mass of blood cells and blood com-\\nponents that form to stop the bleeding that occurs when a\\nblood vessel is injured. When a blood vessel is broken,\\nplatelets in the blood become sticky and clump together\\nat the site of the injury. They begin to form a mass to\\nstop the flow of blood.\\nDescription\\nClotting is the body’s normal response to a bleeding in-\\njury. It is a necessary function to prevent a person from los-\\ning too much blood. Most blood clots dissolve back into the\\nblood when the body has healed the vessel. Blood clots,\\nhowever, can be potentially dangerous if they occur within\\nhealthy blood vessels, or if they do not dissolve when their\\nwork is done. A thrombus is a blood clot that forms along\\nthe wall of the heart or a blood vessel. This type of clot can\\nslow blood flow, and if the clot becomes large enough, it\\nmay stop the flow of blood in the vessel. An embolus is a\\nclot that forms in one area of the body, travels through the\\nbloodstream, and lodges in another vessel in the body. Em-\\nboli are less common and more dangerous, because they\\ncan cause a sudden blockage in blood flow (embolism),\\nwhich could be fatal. An embolism occurring in an artery\\nwill block blood flow to an organ or tissue, and could cause\\ntissue damage or death. An embolism in:\\n• a cerebral (brain) artery can cause a stroke\\n• a coronary artery can cause a heart attack\\n• a pulmonary (lung) artery can cause shortness of breath\\nor death\\n• a retinal artery can cause sudden blindness in one eye\\n• an artery supplying blood to a limb can cause tissue\\ndamage and possibly gangrene\\n• any artery leading to an organ can cause loss of that\\norgan’s function\\nfirmly to apply pressure to the area and prevent further\\nblood vessel ruptures.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nConventional medicine typically follows the same\\nprocedures for treating skin blisters. A prescription or\\nover-the-counter antiseptic ointment may be recom-\\nmended to clean the blistered area.\\nExpected results\\nWith proper treatment, most minor blisters will\\nheal without complication in a matter of days. More se-\\nrious blisters caused by severe burns and certain dis-\\neases may produce permanent scarring or discoloration\\nof the skin.\\nPrevention\\nFriction blisters can be prevented by wearing ade-\\nquate protection on the area prone to blistering. For ex-\\nample, long distance runners can purchase properly fit-\\nting shoes. People who work with their hands or feet can\\npurchase special gloves or shoes and boots. For instance,\\nin 2002, a boot company introduced safety toe footwear\\nfor occupational use with enough room for toes to move\\nfreely without rubbing against steel–toe caps.\\nFair-skinned individuals who are prone to sunburn\\nshould take extra precautions to avoid skin blistering,\\nsuch as using a high SPF sunscreen (at least 30 SPF) and\\nwearing a large brimmed hat and long-sleeved, loose\\nclothing in the sun.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLawless, Julia.

Other factors include varicose\\nveins, childbirth, sickle cell anemia, smoking, obesity,\\nliver disease, and cardiovascular disorders.\\nThere may be no obvious symptoms of a blood clot.\\nWhen symptoms do occur, they often appear suddenly,\\nand point to the location of the clot. Extreme dizziness\\nthat occurs without warning can indicate a clot in a cere-\\nbral artery. Sudden complete or partial blindness in one\\neye could indicate a clot within the retinal artery. A hard\\nblue bulge in a vein, or unexpected pain in an arm or leg,\\nalong with numbness, weakness, or another sign that\\nblood is not reaching the area, could indicate a blood\\nclot. Blisters or ulcers on the skin may occur as well.

A physician\\nmay also notice such physical signs of a blood clot as the\\nswelling blue bulge, discoloration of a limb, or an ulcer.\\nMedical personnel will also check for a missing or low-\\nered pulse or blood pressure in a limb. A Doppler ultra-\\nsound examination, angiography, or arteriography may\\nbe used to detect the location of the clot.\\nTreatment\\nNutritional therapy may include the following: vita-\\nmins B3 (niacin), B6, C, and E; fatty acid and garlic sup-\\nplements; and the minerals zinc, magnesium, and man-\\nganese. Herbal remedies may include cayenne (Cap-\\nsicum frutescens ), other hot peppers, and gingko ( Gink-\\ngo biloba ) to help reduce the protein fibrin, which is a\\nnecessary factor in blood clots. Bilberry (Vaccinium\\nmyrtillus), turmeric (Curcuma longa), and ginger (Zin-\\ngiber officinale) help reduce platelets’ stickiness, which\\nis essential for clot formation.

Blood diseases or\\nother conditions—especially inflammation—that alter the\\nquality of the blood can also affect clot formation. Plaque\\nformation in the arteries (atherosclerosis) and damaged\\nblood vessels both increase the chance of blood clots be-\\ncause they slow blood flow and provide a place for\\nplatelets to collect and form a clot. Genetic factors also\\nplay a role in tendency to form blood clots. Diet can have\\nan effect on clot formation, as well. Cholesterol and satu-\\nrated fats, which are also implicated in atherosclerosis, can\\ncontribute to clot formation. People whose diets are low in\\nessential fatty acids, vegetables, and fish, and who do not\\ntake in proper amounts of nutrients and antioxidants are\\nalso at a higher risk for clots.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 281}, page_content='Blood poisoning\\nDefinition\\nBlood poisoning, also known as septicemia or sep-\\nsis, occurs when the bloodstream becomes infected by\\nbacteria (i.e., staphylococci, streptococci) or fungi intro-\\nduced through a wound,abscess , or other injury. Sep-\\nticemia may also originate from a localized infection in\\nthe body.\\nDescription\\nOver 600,000 cases of septicemia occur in the Unit-\\ned States each year, and approximately two-thirds of\\nthese cases are diagnosed in hospitalized patients. Sep-\\nticemia is an extremely dangerous disorder because it\\nspreads rapidly throughout the body. If bacteria continue\\nto multiply in the bloodstream and the condition pro-\\ngresses to septic shock, blood pressure plummets and\\norgan systems begin to shut down. Septic shock leads to\\nmultiple-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and may\\nresult in death. Although the mortality rate of patients\\nwith sepsis has dropped from 31% in 1979 to 17.4% in\\n1999, over 100,000 sepsis patients die in the United\\nStates each year. Men are more likely than women to de-\\nvelop sepsis, and the prevalence rate among African\\nAmericans is twice the rate seen in Caucasians.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nA septic infection can originate in any wound, in-\\ncluding burns, cuts, punctures, scrapes, abscesses, or a\\nsoft tissue infection. It can also start as a specific infec-\\ntion such as a sinus infection or appendicitis . Invasive\\nsurgical procedures and medical devices, such as\\ncatheters, vascular access grafts, and intravenous lines,\\nalso carry a risk of introducing bacteria to the blood-\\nstream if not properly cleaned and cared for. A large per-\\ncentage of septicemia patients contract the infection in a\\nhospital setting.\\nSepticemia symptoms include:\\n• elevated white blood cell count\\n• fever and chills\\n• rapid breathing\\n• sudden drop in blood pressure\\n• tachycardia (a rapid, pounding heartbeat)\\n• confusion and possible loss of consciousness\\n• warm, flushed skin\\n• skin irregularities, such as subcutaneous red lines, swelling,\\nbleeding under the skin, or necrosis (tissue death)\\nSeptic shock can occur when septicemia is not treat-\\ned adequately or quickly enough. Symptoms of septic\\nshock include:\\n• a severe drop in blood pressure (systolic pressure less\\nthan 90 mmHG and/or less than 40 mmHG of the pa-\\ntient’s baseline blood pressure)\\n• organ dysfunction (such as renal, or kidney, failure)\\ndue to reduced blood flow to the organ systems\\n• loss of consciousness\\nThere are some known risk factors for developing\\nsepticemia. These include:\\n• Having a chronic disorder or disease. The body has a\\ndifficult time fighting infection if the immune system is\\nalready weakened.\\n• Use of immunosuppressive drugs. These drugs also\\nweaken the immune system.\\n• Taking intravenous medications or drugs. Needles can\\nintroduce infectious organisms into the bloodstream if\\nnot used in a sterile manner.\\nDiagnosis\\nThere is no specific laboratory test for early diagno-\\nsis of septicemia. Blood cultures can sometimes deter-\\nmine the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream once the\\ninfection has spread; however, blood cultures require 24\\nhours or longer to incubate. Given the rapidly progressing\\nnature of septicemia, cultures are more effective for con-\\nfirming the diagnosis and narrowing the choice of antibi-\\notics for treatment, as treatment usually must begin be-\\nfore the cultures are complete. In some cases, septicemia\\npatients may have negative blood cultures. Further analy-\\nsis of blood samples by a trained hematologist may be re-\\nquired to make a diagnosis. If the infection is thought to\\nhave spread from a wound or injury, tissue samples from\\nthat site may also be analyzed. Such other body fluids as\\nurine and sputum may be cultured for organisms.\\nTreatment\\nSepticemia is a potentially fatal, rapidly progressing\\ndisease.

Xigris cannot,\\nhowever, be given to patients at high risk for active bleed-\\ning, including those who have just had surgery, have been\\ndiagnosed with an aneurysm or gastrointestinal bleeding,\\nor are being treated with warfarin or platelet inhibitors.\\nExpected results\\nThere is a 17–25% mortality rate for patients with sep-\\nticemia. As the disease progresses to septic shock and\\norgan systems start to be involved, the prognosis worsens.\\nApproximately half of all patients with septic shock die.\\nThe patient’s overall physical health—especially his or her\\nheart function—has a large bearing on his or her chance\\nfor recovery. Early intervention and aggressive treatment\\nof localized infectionsoffer the best chance for survival.\\nPrevention\\nMeticulous infection control techniques are the best\\ndefense against septicemia. For hospitalized patients\\nwho are already at a higher risk of contracting the dis-\\nease, great care should be taken to treat and clean\\nwounds, sutures, and burns using sterile techniques in an\\nantiseptic environment. The same applies for maintain-\\ning such invasive medical devices as intravenous lines,\\ncatheters, and gastric and nasal tubes. The use of these\\ndevices should be limited whenever possible.\\nOne recently introduced preventive is the use of an-\\ntibiotic-coated catheters in hospitalized patients. This\\npractice is, however, controversial as of 2002.

Blue cohosh is\\na plant that has long been believed to conform to the\\ndoctrine of signatures, which is an ancient idea that the\\nphysical shape of plants gives a clue to their medicinal\\nuses. Blue cohosh has branches that are arranged like\\nlimbs in spasm, and the herb has been used to treat mus-\\ncle spasms. It should not be confused with an unrelated\\nherb,black cohosh.\\nBlue cohosh was widely used by Native Americans\\nto treat a variety of conditions, ranging from parasites to\\nnervous disorders. The Native Americans referred to the\\nherb as squaw root or papoose root, because of its effec-\\ntiveness in treating female problems, inducing child-\\nbirth and easing the pain of labor. Other common\\nnames for the herb are beechdrops, blue ginseng, yellow\\nginseng, and blueberry root.\\nBlue cohosh contains several important minerals, in-\\ncluding potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, silicon\\nand phosphorus. An active ingredient has been isolated\\nfrom the herb called caulosaponin , a chemical that has\\nbeen shown to increase blood flow to the uterus and re-\\nduce uterine contractions. Blue cohosh has been shown\\nto be an emmenagogue , which means it helps to bring\\nabout menstruation , and to be an anti-spasmodic, or a\\nsubstance which reduces muscle spasms.\\nGeneral use\\nBlue cohosh is recommended as a general tonic for\\ngynecological problems, specifically for the uterus. Blue\\ncohosh is used for menstrual problems, such as amenor-\\nrhea (absence of menstrual cycles) and dysmenorrhea\\n(painful periods), and to reduce the pain of menstrual\\ncramps. During pregnancy, it can be used when there is\\na threat of miscarriage, and to reduce false labor pains.\\nUsed just before childbirth, it is reputed to ease pain and\\nfacilitate the birthing process. A 1999 survey of the use\\nof herbal preparations among nurse-midwives found that\\nblue cohosh was the herb most commonly used to stimu-\\nlate labor contractions.\\nBlue cohosh’s antispasmodic properties enable it to\\nbe used in some cases of asthma, colic, and nervous\\ncoughs. Blue cohosh is also used to reduce pain in some\\ncases of rheumatoid arthritis.\\nBlue cohosh is also used in homeopathy . The\\nhomeopathic remedy made from blue cohosh is called\\nCaulophyllum, and is recommended for menstrual\\ncramps, PMS, dysmenorrhea, and support during child-\\nbirth. Homeopaths may also prescribe Caulophyllum for\\ngout, rheumatism, false labor pains, and gonorrhea.\\nBloodroot contains skin-irritating compounds.\\nWhen applied topically it may burn the skin or cause the\\nskin to become red.\\nInteractions\\nToothpastes or mouthwashes usually only contain\\nsmall amounts of sanguinarine and are considered safe\\nfor long-term use.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nChevalier, Andrew.

Sweat is generally an odorless body secretion.\\nWhen bacteria multiply on the skin and break down\\nthese secretions, however, the resulting by-products may\\nhave a strong and disagreeable odor. This odor is often\\ndue to poor personal hygiene, but excessive perspiration\\nor some other underlying disease is sometimes involved.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nPeople produce two kinds of sweat, eccrine and\\napocrine. Eccrine sweat glands secrete a mixture of\\nwater, salt (sodium chloride), urea, and lactic acid onto\\nthe skin. When a person is overheated, sweat seeps over\\nthe body, especially where the eccrine glands are numer-\\nous. These glands are concentrated in the armpits, the\\npalms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and the fore-\\nhead. As the sweat dries off, the skin is cooled by the\\nsurrounding air. Eccrine glands do not release any tissue\\ncells or cell contents into their watery secretions.\\nIn contrast with eccrine sweat, apocrine sweat is a\\nheavier liquid containing various organic substances, in-\\ncluding pheromone hormones. These glands are found\\nmostly under the arms and around the groin. They devel-\\nop during puberty, and are thought to serve a biological\\nfunction in sexual attraction. Apocrine glands take their\\nname from the fact that these glands release the apical\\nportion, or tip, of the secreting cell into the liquid along\\nwith the other substances.\\nSweat is essentially odorless when it is secreted, and\\nthe sweat from the eccrine glands remains so. It creates,\\nhowever, a moist environment in which some of the bac-\\nteria that naturally occur on human skin can multiply.\\nThese bacteria are attracted to the sweat produced by the\\napocrine glands, and a strong odor is produced when\\nthese substances interact. On the other hand, however,\\nthe eccrine sweat glands may also help to regulate the\\ntypes of bacteria on the body surface. Researchers in\\nGermany have recently discovered that these glands se-\\ncrete a peptide that has antimicrobial properties strong\\nenough to kill some disease bacteria.\\nPeople who have a condition known as hyperhidro-\\nsis tend to sweat excessively, and therefore, they are\\nmore likely to develop a strong body odor. Bromhidrosis\\nis the name for a medical condition in which an individ-\\nual’s sweat always has an unpleasant odor.\\nThe human body normally has a slight sweaty or\\nmusky odor. Generally, bathing with soap and water, to-\\ngether with the use of deodorants or antiperspirants, is\\nsufficient to prevent a truly unpleasant, unhealthy odor.\\nThere are, however, several factors that may contribute\\nto chronic body odor.

Frey, PhD\\nBoils\\nDefinition\\nBoils are bacterial infections of hair follicles and the\\nsurrounding skin that form pustules around the follicle.\\nBoils are sometimes called furuncles. When several furun-\\ncles merge to form a single deep sore with several “heads,”\\nor drainage points, the result is called a carbuncle.\\nDescription\\nBoils are firm, red swellings about 5–10 mm across\\nthat are slightly raised above the skin surface. They are\\nsore to the touch. A boil usually has a visible central core\\nof pus; a carbuncle is larger and has several visible heads.\\nBoils occur most commonly on the face, back of the\\nneck, buttocks, upper legs and groin area, armpits, and\\nupper torso. Carbuncles are less common than single\\nboils; they are most likely to form at the back of the neck.\\nMen are more likely than women to develop carbuncles.\\nAs the infection that causes the boil develops, an\\narea of inflamed tissue gradually forms a pus-filled\\nswelling or pimple that is painful to touch. As the boil\\nmatures, it forms a yellowish head or point. It may either\\ncontinue to swell until the point bursts open and allows\\nthe pus to drain, or it may be gradually reabsorbed into\\nthe skin. It generally takes between one and two weeks\\nfor a boil to heal completely after it comes to a head and\\ndischarges pus. The bacteria that cause the boil can\\nspread into other areas of the skin or even into the blood-\\nstream if the skin around the boil is squeezed. If the in-\\nfection spreads, the patient will usually develop chills,\\nfever, and swollen lymph nodes. Red lines may appear\\non the skin running outward from the boil.\\nBoils and carbuncles are common problems in the\\ngeneral population, particularly among adolescents and\\nadults. People who are most likely to develop these skin\\ninfections include those with:\\n• diabetes, especially when treated by injected insulin\\n• alcoholism or drug abuse\\n• recent experience of childbirth, especially women who\\nare breastfeeding their babies\\n• poor personal hygiene\\n• crowded living arrangements\\n• jobs or hobbies that expose them to greasy or oily sub-\\nstances, especially petroleum products\\n• hair styles requiring frequent use of hair relaxers\\n• allergies or immune system disorders, including HIV\\ninfection\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBoils are most often caused by Staphylococcus au-\\nreus (staph), a bacterium that causes an infection in an\\noil gland or hair follicle. Although the surface of human\\nskin is usually resistant to bacterial infection, staph can\\nenter through a break in the skin surface, including\\nbreaks caused by needle punctures for insulin or drug in-\\njections. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy\\ncreams, petroleum jelly, hair relaxers, or similar products\\nare more vulnerable to developing boils.

Carbunculosis is\\na word that is sometimes used to refer to the develop-\\nment of carbuncles. The abscesses spread until they\\nmerge with each other to form a single large area of in-\\nfected skin with several pus-filled heads. Patients with\\ncarbuncles may also have a low-grade fever or feel gen-\\nerally unwell.\\nFurunculosis is a word used to refer to recurrent boils.\\nMany patients have repeated episodes of furunculosis that\\nare difficult to treat because their nasal passages carry\\ncolonies of staph. Skin and anal colonization are fairly\\ncommon as well. Persistent furunculosis may be an indi-\\ncation of a depressed immune system. A physician should\\nbe consulted if boils are a persistent problem in order to\\ndetermine whether there is an underlying disease such as\\ndiabetes, HIV infection, or immune system disorders.\\nDiagnosis\\nA diagnosis of boils is usually made on the basis of\\nvisual examination of the skin. For the most part, boils\\nare not difficult to distinguish. A doctor can make a cul-\\nture from pus taken from the boil to confirm the diagno-\\nsis and treatment. The patient’s nasal discharge may also\\nbe tested. In cases of persistent recurrent boils, family\\nmembers or close contacts may be examined to see if\\nthey are carriers of staph.\\nTreatment\\nPatient education is an important part of the treat-\\nment of boils. Patients need to be warned against squeez-\\ning boils because of the danger of spreading the infection\\ninto other parts of the skin or bloodstream. It is especial-\\nly important to avoid squeezing boils around the mouth\\nor nose, because infections in these areas may be carried\\nto the brain, although this happens rarely. Patients should\\nalso be advised about keeping the skin clean, washing\\ntheir hands carefully before and after touching the boil,\\navoiding the use of greasy cosmetics or creams, and\\nkeeping their towels and washcloths separate from those\\nof other family members.\\nThe use of the following supplements is reported to\\nbe effective in treating boils: zinc, 45 mg per day; vita-\\nmin A, 50,000 IUs per day for two weeks; vitamin C,1\\ng three times per day; and beta-carotene, 100,000 IUs\\nper day.\\nTaking the proper homeopathic medication in the\\nfirst stages of a boil can bring about early resolution of\\nthe infection and prevent pus formation. The most likely\\nchoices are belladonna or Hepar sulphuris . If the boil\\nhas already formed, Mercurius vivus or silica may be\\nrecommended to bring the pus to a head.\\nA variety of herbal remedies can be applied topical-\\nly to fight infection. These include essential oils of berg-\\namot, Citrus bergamia; chamomile, Matricaria recutita;\\nlavender, Lavandula officinalis; and sage, Salvia offici-\\nnalis; as well as tea tree oil, Melaleuca spp. Application\\nof a paste or poultice containing goldenseal root, Hy-\\ndrastis canadensis, is recommended to help kill bacteria\\nand to reduce inflammation. Washing the skin around the\\naffected area with a mixture of goldenseal,Hydrastis\\ncanadensis, and witch hazel, Hamamelis virginiana, dis-\\nsolved in warm water is also recommended.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nBoils are usually treated with application of antibi-\\notic creams, following the application of hot compresses.\\nThe compresses help the infection to come to a head and\\ndrain and are an important part of the treatment regime.\\nCarbuncles and furunculosis are usually treated with oral\\nantibiotics as well as antibiotic creams or ointments. The\\nusual course of oral antibiotics is 5-10 days; however,\\npatients with recurrent furunculosis may be given oral\\nantibiotics for longer periods. Patients with bacterial\\ncolonies in their nasal passages are often given\\nmupirocin ointment (Bactroban) to apply directly to the\\nlining of the nose and should wash the area once a month\\nwith an antiseptic soap such as Phisohex.\\nBoils or carbuncles that are very large or that do not\\nresolve may be opened with a sterile needle or surgical\\nknife to allow the pus to drain. Surgical treatment of\\nboils is often painful and usually leaves noticeable scars.\\nThe increase of antibiotic- and biocide-resistant\\nstrains of Staphylococcus aureus has caused growing\\nconcern among doctors, as some of these strains are now\\nresistant to disinfectants used to clean endoscopes and\\nother surgical equipment. Resveratrol, which is a phy-\\ntoalexin, or compound formed by plants at the site of a\\nfungal or bacterial invasion, appears to be highly effec-\\ntive in treating boils and other skin infections in humans\\ncaused by S. aureus.\\nExpected results\\nBoils usually drain or are reabsorbed in two or three\\ndays. Recurrent boils and carbuncles, however, are fairly\\ncommon. In addition, although the spread of infection\\nfrom boils is relatively unusual, there have been deaths re-\\nported from brain infections caused by squeezing boils on\\nthe upper lip or in the tissue folds at the base of the nose.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2272\\nBoils\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 272'),\n",

Frey, PhD\\nBonemeal\\nDescription\\nBonemeal is a product created from the waste resulting\\nfrom the slaughter of animals, especially beef cattle, by meat\\nprocessors. It is a white powder made by grinding either raw\\nor steamed animal bones. This results in a product that con-\\ntains the same nutrients necessary for the production of, and\\nmaintenance of, bone in both humans and animals.\\nThe composition of bonemeal can vary. Phospho-\\nrus, in the form of chemical compounds related to phos-\\nphates, makes up 20–30% of the powder. In addition to\\nits mineral content, depending upon the amount of ten-\\ndon and muscle left on the bones, bonemeal can be a\\nfairly good source of protein.\\nThe nutrients typically present in bonemeal include\\nthe minerals calcium , phosphorus, iron, magnesium\\nand zinc, as well as traces of other elements. Bonemeal,\\nespecially when not steamed or cooked, is also rich in vi-\\ntamins A and D.\\nGeneral use\\nCalcium is the most significant nutrient in bone-\\nmeal. Calcium is particularly significant to women be-\\ncause of its essential role in the prevention of osteoporo-\\nsis. A 1999 report of the American Dietetic Association\\nand Dietitians of Canada entitled Women’s Health and\\nNutrition states that either osteoporosis or osteopenia af-\\nfects more than 30 million Americans (mostly women).\\nThat same report states that osteoporosis is an irre-\\nversible disease process. However, it has been found that\\nincreasing bone mass early in life may prevent its occur-\\nrence or at least lessen its severity. Bone is living tissue\\nPrevention\\nTo minimize the risk of developing bacterial skin in-\\nfections the skin should be kept clean; to avoid spreading\\nthe infection, washcloths, towels, and facial cosmetics\\nshould not be shared with others.

This process of bone buildup and\\nbreakdown is very dependent upon the amount of calci-\\num taken in. Calcium, especially when ingested along\\nwith vitamin D , increases bone mass, and can actually\\nsustain the health of bones during the later portions of a\\nwoman’s life when the body naturally loses bone during\\nmenopauseand old age. It is estimated that menopausal\\nwomen age 50–60 can lose 10–40% of their bone mass.\\nIt is consistently reported that American women are\\nnot meeting even minimum requirements for calcium in-\\ntake according to the recommendations of the American\\nDietetic Association (ADA). Although the ADA recom-\\nmends that people’s intake of calcium be consumed via\\nfoods rich in this element, such as low-fat dairy foods, it\\nfurther recognizes that some people cannot eat these\\nfoods at all, or cannot take in sufficient quantities to max-\\nimize bone health. It therefore concludes that for those\\npersons who cannot consume sufficient calcium rich\\nfoods, it will usually be necessary for them to take sup-\\nplements containing calcium, and sometimes vitamin D\\nas well. Bonemeal provides both of these nutrients. Re-\\ncent research even reports that calcium supplements can\\nhelp prevent formation of kidney stones when combined\\nwith a fairly low animal protein, low salt diet. Doctors\\nonce advised a low-calcium diet to prevent kidney stones.\\nBonemeal, with its 20–30% phosphate content, is an\\nimportant organic fertilizer used in gardening of all\\ntypes. Raw bonemeal works more slowly as a fertilizer\\nthan steamed bonemeal. Both work more slowly than\\nother fertilizers, making bonemeal an ideal source of\\nnourishment for bulb plants, such as tulips, crocuses,\\ndaffodils, and irises, that are planted several months be-\\nfore growth and blooming occur.\\nPreparations\\nBonemeal tablets are available from health food\\nstores. A typical dose of four tablets per day would com-\\nmonly contain the following nutrients:\\n• calcium: 880 mg\\n• phosphorus: 400 mg\\n• iron: 1.8 mg\\n• natural vitamin A: 4,000 units\\n• natural vitamin D: 400 units\\n• red bone marrow: 15 mg\\nPrecautions\\nPhosphates present in bonemeal could potentially be\\nleached into water systems if bonemeal fertilizer is used\\nalong shorelines.

The Native American name for boneset trans-\\nlates into ague-weed (ague is the name for malarial\\nfever). The common name, boneset, comes from break-\\nbone fever, an influenza-like illness causing severe bone\\npainthat was treated with Eupatorium perfoliatum.\\nBoneset prefers a damp environment and is found in\\nmarshes and meadows, often at the edge of a wooded\\narea. Although boneset can reach a height of 5 ft (1.5 m),\\nit is usually only 2–4 ft (0.6–1.2 m) tall. It has an erect,\\nround, hairy stem that branches at the top. The leaves are\\nlarge (4–8 in, or 10–20 cm, long), directly across from\\none another, and are joined at the stem. Lower leaves are\\nlarge, and they become progressively smaller higher up\\nthe plant. They are spear shaped with toothed edges and\\npointy tips, have prominent veins, a rough topside, and a\\ndowny, dotted, sticky underside.\\nBoneset blooms between July and September.\\nLarge, numerous, white or purple flower clusters, which\\nappear at the ends of the branches, are comprised of\\n10–20 florets (small flowers). Boneset has a faint aroma\\nand a very bitter taste.\\nConstituents and bioactivities\\nBoneset contains a wide variety of compounds with\\nbiological activity that contribute to its medicinal value.\\nConstituents of boneset include:\\n• sesquiterpene lactones (euccannabinolide, eufoliatin,\\neufoliatorin, eupafolin, euperfolide, euperfolitin, and\\nhelenalin)\\n• polysaccharides (4-0-methylglucuroxylans)\\n• flavonoids (astragalin, eupatorin, hyperoside, kaempfer-\\nol, quercitin, rutin, etc.)\\n• diterpenes (dendroidinic acid and hebenolide)\\n• sterol\\n• volatile oil\\n• tannic acid\\n• resin\\n• gum\\nSesquiterpene lactones have antimicrobial, antitumor,\\nand cytotoxic activities. The flavonoid eupatorin has cyto-\\ntoxic activity. Sesquiterpene lactones and polysaccharides\\nstimulate the immune system. Boneset extracts also acti-\\nvate defense mechanisms against viral infections.\\nBoneset has stimulant, febrifuge (reduces body tem-\\nperature), laxative (promotes bowel movements), di-\\naphoretic (promotes sweating), bitter, tonic (restores tis-\\nsue tone), anti-spasmodic (relieves muscle spasms),\\ncarminative (relieves intestinal gas), and astringent\\n(causes skin contraction) activities.\\nGeneral use\\nBoneset was used by Native Americans (who later\\ntaught the colonists) to treat influenza, colds, and other\\ninfectious diseases as well as fever, arthritis, and rheuma-\\ntism. By the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Euro-\\npean settlers considered boneset to be a cure-all. As a re-\\nsult, boneset was used to treat many different diseases\\nand conditions. It was, perhaps, among the most widely\\nused herbal medicines in the United States. Dried boneset\\nwas kept on hand by families, as well as doctors, for im-\\nmediate use, especially during the flu season.\\nBoneset is used to treat colds, influenza, fevers,\\ncoughs, upper respiratory tract congestion, migraine,\\nheadache, skin conditions,worms, malaria, constipation,\\narthritis, muscular rheumatism,jaundice, and general de-\\nbility. Boneset is also used to treat secondary infections that\\narise during colds or flu. Secondary infections, such as\\nbronchitis, pneumonia, or tonsillitis, are infections that\\noccur while the patient has another illness. Currently,\\nherbalists recommend boneset primarily for relieving the\\naches and pains associated with fever, clearing congestion,\\nand relieving pain caused by arthritis and rheumatism.\\nBoneset is considered to be among the best remedies\\nfor the flu. Its wide spectrum of activities brings relief to\\nthe many symptoms associated with the flu. It helps reduce\\nfever by promoting sweating, reduces aches and pains, and\\nrelieves congestion by loosening phlegm and promoting\\ncoughing. Boneset also stimulates the immune system,\\nwhich promotes the destruction of the influenza virus.\\nPreparations\\nAll above-ground portions of the plant have medici-\\nnal value.

The biological activities can be extracted either in\\nwater or alcohol, or the plant can be used as the fresh or\\ndried herb. Boneset is used in the dried form and is avail-\\nable commercially as dried flowers and leaves, as a tinc-\\nture (an alcohol solution), and in tablets and capsules.\\nBoneset is usually taken as an infusion (tea). To\\nmake the infusion, 2-3 teaspoons of dried herb are\\nsteeped in one cup of boiling water for 10-15 minutes.\\nTo improve boneset’s bitter taste, lemon and honey may\\nbe added to the infusion, or the infusion may be mixed\\nwith a flavorful herbal tea or fruit juice.\\nBoneset may be taken as soon as flu symptoms ap-\\npear. To treat influenza, fever, or colds, one cup of hot\\nboneset infusion should be drunk every two hours—up\\nto six cups daily—for two days. Then the dose can be\\nreduced to four cups daily. High doses shouldn’t be\\ntaken over a long period of time. The tea should be\\nstopped if it has been used for a week and has not\\nhelped improve symptoms. To act as a diaphoretic, the\\npatient should remain in bed covered with multiple\\nblankets. Sweating begins after the patient has drunk\\nfour to five doses of the hot infusion. Up to four cups\\nmay be drunk within six hours; however, the patient\\nshould not drink more than six cups within 24 hours.\\nAlternatively, 2-4 ml of the tincture may be taken three\\ntimes a day.\\nWhen taken in larger doses, boneset infusion can act\\nas an emetic (causes vomiting ) and purgative (causes\\nevacuation of the bowels). Boneset infusion is drunk\\ncold, in moderate doses (one-fourth cup), to act as a\\ntonic to treat indigestion and general debility.\\nBoneset may be taken in combination with\\ncayenne, elder flowers, ginger, lemon balm , pepper-\\nmint, or yarrow to treat influenza. For bronchial con-\\nditions, boneset may be taken with pleurisy root and\\nelecampane.\\nPrecautions\\nFresh boneset contains tremerol, a toxic chemical\\nwhich can cause rapid breathing and vomiting. Higher\\ndoses can cause coma and death. Dried boneset does not\\ncontain tremerol. Boneset may cause liver toxicity, so al-\\ncoholics and people with liver disease should consult an\\nherbalist before using this herb. Boneset should not be\\ntaken for longer than two weeks at a time.\\nSide effects\\nBoneset does not generally cause any serious side\\neffects. However, taking large doses of boneset may\\ncause nausea or diarrhea. Boneset may cause liver toxi-\\ncity in chronic high doses.\\nInteractions\\nAs of early 2000, there was no evidence of interac-\\ntions between boneset and other herbals or conventional\\nmedicines.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nSharma, Om P., Rajinder K.

The spurs may cause slight dis-\\ncomfort, or severe pain.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBone spurs have several possible causes. Some are a re-\\nsult of osteoarthritis. This condition begins without symp-\\ntoms from age 20–30, and is marked by the loss of cartilage\\nin the joints. Once the cartilage is gone, there is no cushion\\nto protect the joints from the strain of physical activity or\\nbearing weight. The bones rub together and bone spurs may\\ngrow in and around the joints. By the age of 70, almost\\neveryone is afflicted with this condition. Bone spurs can also\\nbe found in older adults who have disk problems. As people\\ngrow older, the disks in the spinal column can become tough\\nand shrink. The distance between the vertebrae decreases as\\nthe disks shrink, and bone spurs, or knobby growths, then\\nappear on the vertebrae. Bone spurs are also found in those\\nwho have placed an excessive amount of stresson their bod-\\nies, such as dancers, athletes, and laborers.\\nSpurs in particular regions of the spine may cause\\npain in a specific area. Those located in the upper verte-\\nbrae of the neck (cervical region) may cause stiffness\\nand pain in the back and neck.\\nSpurs located in the feet can be particularly painful.\\nBone spurs occur most often on the heel ( heel spurs ),\\nbut can be found on any part of the foot that has been\\nunder pressure. This condition can be caused by shoes\\nthat fit improperly, excessive use, or heredity.\\nMost bone spurs cause pain because of their move-\\nment against nerves or other bones. Pain or stiffness in\\nthe back or neck, or tingling in the hands, arms, or neck,\\ncan indicate bone spurs on the spine. Headaches and\\ndizzinessmay also occur, and a person may not be able\\nto keep balanced. A heel spur can cause a sharp pain\\nwhen weight is placed on one or both feet. If there is a\\nsevere, shooting pain in the neck or back with slight\\nmovement, this could be a sign of a bone spur pinching a\\nnerve or interfering with muscle movement.\\nDiagnosis\\nA medical practitioner may order a computer assisted\\ntomography (CAT) scan or x ray to rule out other causes\\nof back pain and to help locate any bone spurs that exist.\\nAn electromyography (EMG) can look at the condition of\\nnerves that supply muscles to see if they are affected by\\nbone spurs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can look\\nat bones, nerves, and disks to check for abnormalities.\\nTreatment\\nExercise and a healthy weight are key ingredients to\\nmanaging the pain associated with bone spurs. Exercise\\nmay be limited by the location of the spur and its effects\\non movement. Swimming or other forms of water activi-\\nty, such as water aerobics, may be less stressful for the\\nbody, and can also increase flexibility and mobility.\\nWeight loss can also be beneficial in alleviating the pain\\nassociated with bone spurs, since less weight puts less\\nstress on any joints which are lacking cartilage or\\nplagued with bone spurs.\\nThere are several options for managing the pain\\ncaused by bone spurs and increasing movement. A chiro-\\npractor may use manipulation and physical therapy to re-\\nlieve pain associated with bone spurs in the vertebrae.\\nPhysical therapy may also increase movement of the af-\\nfected area. Acupuncture can be used to relieve some\\njoint pain. A homeopath will assess more than a patient’s\\nphysical condition to determine the proper remedy. The\\ntypes of conditions that trigger the pain are important in-\\nformation for a homeopath. Guided imagery can help\\nalleviate pain. Feldenkrais method can be used to re-\\ntrain the body’s movement when it is inhibited by pain.\\nYogais another movement therapy that can help de-\\ncrease the stress placed on affected areas, as well as help\\nthe body to relax and strengthen muscles. Sodium in the\\ndiet may help break down calcium so that it can be re-\\nsorbed into the blood. Those on a low-sodium diet for\\nhealth reasons should talk to their doctors before increas-\\ning the sodium in their diets.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA doctor will usually prescribe anti-inflammatory\\npainkillers, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, to help relieve\\npain.

There are\\nas many as 2,500 species in this family of plants. The\\nspecific designation officinalis indicates the herb’s inclu-\\nsion in official listings of medicinal plants. Borage is a\\nwild-growing, hardy native of the Mediterranean region,\\ncultivated and naturalized throughout Great Britain and\\nNorth America. Traditionally associated with courage,\\nborage was used to flavor the wine for soldiers preparing\\nfor battle. The English word “borage” may be derived\\nfrom the word borrach, a Celtic word meaning “a person\\nof courage.” In folk tradition throughout its long history\\nof recorded use, borage was believed to dispel melan-\\ncholy and ease grief and sadness. According to the an-\\ncient Greek physician Dioscorides, borage can “cheer\\nthe heart and lift the depressed spirits.” Common names\\nfor the herb include burrage, common bugloss, star\\nflower, tailwort, or beebread. Borage self-seeds freely\\nand flourishes in rich, well-drained soil in full sun. It is a\\ngood companion herb in the cottage garden, attracting\\nhoney bees and imparting strength and insect resistance\\nto nearby plants, particularly strawberry and tomato.\\nBorage’s silvery-green, oblong to ovate, textured\\nleaves form a basal rosette, then grow alternately up a\\nsucculent hollow round stem containing a clear mucilage.\\nThe leaves and sprawling branches are covered in bristly\\nwhite hairs that impart a silvery sheen to the herb and are\\nirritating to the skin on contact. Borage can reach a height\\nof 2 ft (0.6 m), with leaves as long as 5 in (13 cm). The\\nfive-petaled star-shaped blue flowers, each with five\\nblack anthers, grow in loose, downward-turning clusters\\nat the apex of the stems. Borage may bloom continuously\\nfrom early spring until frost. The large, brownish-black\\nseeds are three-sided. They may be viable for as long as\\neight years. The roots are shallow and spreading.\\nGeneral use\\nBorage seed oil\\nIn contrast to borage’s centuries of use as a herb,\\nborage seed oil has been used only for the last 10 years.\\nBorage oil, extracted from the seeds by cold pressing,\\ncontains omega-6 essential fatty acids, with as much as\\na 25–30% concentration of gamma linolenic acid (GLA).\\nGLA is a derivative of the omega-6 fatty acids . It is an\\nessential fatty acid used by the body to produce\\nprostaglandins, the hormone-like substances in the body\\nthat may be out of balance in premenstrual syndrome\\n(PMS) or during menopause . GLA also appears to re-\\nduce the adherence of plaque (abnormal patches of hard-\\nened deposits) to artery walls, thus lowering the risk of\\ncoronary heart disease. GLA helps to relieve PMS, reg-\\nulate the menstrual cycle, and ease the hot flashes and\\nmood swings of menopause.\\nAt present, borage seed oil is best known for its anti-\\ninflammatory properties. The oil has been shown in clin-\\nical studies with human subjects to be useful in treating\\nthe following conditions:\\n• rheumatoid arthritis\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2278\\nBorage oil\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 278'),\n",

Various borage oil products that make these\\nclaims, however, are readily available over the Internet.\\nCulinary and medicinal uses\\nBorage’s culinary and medicinal uses have been\\nknown for at least 2000 years. Borage is a cooling,\\ncleansing, and refreshing herb with adaptogenic, demul-\\ncent, diuretic, expectorant, and anti-inflammatory prop-\\nerties. The entire plant contains mucilage, tannin, essen-\\ntial oil,potassium , calcium , pyrrolizioline alkaloids,\\nsaponins, and vitamin C , as well as a high amount of\\nmineral salts. The leaves have been used as an adrenal\\ntonic to balance and restore the health of the adrenal\\nglands following periods of stress. A tea made from the\\nleaves and blossoms will also promote lactation, relieve\\nfevers, and promote sweating, The soothing mucilage in\\nborage makes it a beneficial treatment for dry cough and\\nthroat irritation. Borage tea is also a good remedy to use\\nwith such digestive disturbances as gastritis and irrita-\\nble bowel syndrome. European herbalists use borage tea\\nto restore strength during convalescence. It may be of\\nparticular benefit during recovery from surgery or fol-\\nlowing steroid treatment. Borage tea is also helpful in\\nclearing up such skin problems as boils and rashes, and\\nhas been used as an eyewash.\\nAbout a dozen clinical tests of the medicinal applica-\\ntions of borage in human subjects have been conducted\\nsince 1989. In addition, some researchers are now testing\\nthe effects of borage on skin cells in animal studies.\\nPreparations\\nThe leaves, flowers, and seeds of borage have nutri-\\ntive and medicinal properties. Harvest borage leaves on a\\ndry day, just as the plant begins to blossom. Strip the\\nleaves from the stems and spread out on a tray. The plant\\nhas a high water content and the leaves may discolor if\\ndried in direct heat. Place the drying trays in a warm,\\nairy room out of direct sun. When thoroughly dry, store\\nthe leaves in dark, tightly-sealed containers. Borage\\nflowers can be collected by gently pulling on the stamen\\ntips to separate the blossom from the green backing at-\\ntached to the stem. The blossoms may be used fresh, or\\nfrozen individually in ice-cube trays for later use.\\nInfusion: Place 2 oz (56 g) of fresh borage leaves in\\na warmed glass container. Bring 2.5 cups (590 ml) of\\nfresh, nonchlorinated water to the boiling point, add it to\\nthe herbs. Cover. Allow the tea to steep for 10 minutes,\\nstrain, and drink warm. The prepared tea can be stored\\nfor two days in the refrigerator. Borage tea may be en-\\njoyed by the cupful up to three times a day. Some herbal-\\nists suggest combining borage with hawthorn berries\\n(Crataegus oxyacantha) as a heart tonic.\\nPoultice: Chop fresh borage leaves and stems in suf-\\nficient quantity to cover the area being treated. Cover the\\nherb with a strip of cotton gauze to hold the poultice in\\nplace. The poultice may be soothing and healing to skin\\ninflammations, though the prickly hairs may be irritating.\\nCulinary: Borage leaves, eaten fresh, have a crisp, cool\\ntaste, reminiscent of cucumber but with a somewhat prickly\\ntexture. Borage blossoms are sometimes used as a garnish\\non salads or crystallized and used to decorate cakes.\\nBorage oil is available commercially as bottled oil\\nand in capsule form. One manufacturer offers a package\\ncontaining 90 capsules for $20. The usual recommended\\ndoses of GLA range from 100–300 mg daily (1 tbsp of\\nbottled oil or 1–3 capsules). The dosage and duration of\\nuse, however, are best determined by a qualified herbal\\npractitioner.\\nPrecautions\\nBorage oil has been shown to contain small amounts\\nof such pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) as lycopsamine,\\namabiline, and thesinine. Some pyrrolizidine alkaloids,\\nparticularly unsaturated ones, may be toxic to the liver\\neven in small amounts. Some herbalists stress that use of\\nborage oil should be avoided unless the preparations are\\ncertified to be free of these potentially harmful, unsatu-\\nrated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. In addition, borage oil\\nshould be refrigerated after opening to keep it stable, as\\nGLA is damaged in the presence of oxidation. Blending\\nsmall amounts of vitamin E or vitamin C into the oil\\nwill also help to slow down the process of oxidation.\\nThe long-term use of herbal borage in medicinal\\npreparations is not recommended.\\nSide effects\\nSome minor side effects have been reported when bor-\\nage preparations are taken internally, even when taken in\\nappropriate forms and in therapeutic dosages.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 298}, page_content='Evidence has been mounting in the last two decades,\\nhowever, that suggests boron may be an important mi-\\ncronutrient.\\nStudies indicate that boron may contribute to the\\nway that calcium, a vital building block of bone, and\\nother minerals are processed by the body. Boron appears\\nto increase the amount of calcium absorbed from food\\nand lower the amount excreted by the body. These ef-\\nfects may help to keep bones strong. Boron may also im-\\nprove mental functioning, strengthen the immune sys-\\ntem, boost energy utilization, and affect cholesterol pro-\\nduction. While the effects of a boron-free diet have not\\nbeen observed in people, animal studies suggest that a\\nlack of boron can be unhealthy. In one investigation, for\\nexample, a boron-deficient diet fed to animals seemed to\\nincrease the amount of calcium they lost. It also ap-\\npeared to have a negative effect on bone development\\nand energy utilization. It is not certain, however, that\\nstudy results such as this confirm the nutritional impor-\\ntance of boron for human beings. As of 2000, research is\\nstill necessary to determine if boron can produce signifi-\\ncant health benefits safely and effectively. The proper\\ndosage of the mineral has not yet been established.\\nGeneral use\\nWhile not extensively studied, boron has been tout-\\ned as having a number of beneficial effects. Some people\\ntake it to help treat osteoporosis or arthritis and to allevi-\\nate menopausal symptoms. It has been reported to en-\\nhance mental activity, memory, and hand-eye coordina-\\ntion. Some body builders and athletes take boron supple-\\nments as a muscle-enhancing agent despite the fact that\\nthere is no evidence to support this use. Overall, boron\\nappears to have the most potential as a possible bone-\\nbuilder and brain booster.\\nThe effects of boron on bone strength were investi-\\ngated in a small study of 12 postmenopausal women be-\\ntween the ages of 48 and 82, published in the FASEB\\nJournal in 1987. The women had received a low-boron\\ndiet (containing about 0.25 mg a day of the mineral) for\\nseveral months before being given daily boron supple-\\nments of 3 mg. Once the women increased their intake of\\nboron, they were able to retain more bone-building min-\\nerals such as calcium and magnesium. This effect was\\ngreater in women who started out with low levels of mag-\\nnesium. Boron supplements also significantly increased\\nlevels of estrogen and testosterone, especially in the mag-\\nnesium-deficient group. The results of this study suggest\\nthat getting an adequate amount of boron, whether\\nthrough dietary intake or boron supplements, may help to\\nmaintain strong bones by allowing the body to use calci-\\num and other important minerals more efficiently.\\nMost of the research suggesting that boron may be\\nhelpful for arthritis is indirect and circumstantial. Early\\nstudies in sheep and chickens indicated that boron may\\nbe useful in helping to treat the disease. There is also an\\ninteresting relationship between the incidence of arthritis\\nand boron intake in certain geographical locations. In\\nparts of the world where boron intake is high (intake can\\nrange anywhere from 3–10 mg), usually as a result of\\nhigh boron levels in the soil and water, the number of\\npeople who develop arthritis tends to be lower than in\\nareas where people consume less of the mineral. Boron\\nlevels in the water and soil are usually highest in arid cli-\\nmates, such as the desert regions of the United States and\\nSouth America, the Red Sea region of the Middle East,\\nand parts of Australia. There are few human studies of\\nboron in relation to arthritis, although one small investi-\\ngation in people has suggested that boron may help to re-\\nlieve symptoms of the disease.\\nWhile there is some evidence that boron may be\\nhelpful in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis,\\nthe mineral does not appear to ease the symptoms associ-\\nated with menopause. In a five-week study involving 46\\nmenopausal women, about 50% of those who received\\nboron supplements experienced more frequent and severe\\nhot flashes(as well as night sweats) and generally had an\\nincrease in menopausal symptoms. Over a third of the\\nwomen who received boron reported that the mineral\\nmade no difference at all in their symptoms. Boron had a\\nbeneficial effect in only 15% of the women who took it.\\nThese findings suggest that boron may actually aggravate\\nmenopausal symptoms more often than it alleviates them.\\nResearchers from the Grand Forks Human Nutrition\\nResearch Center, which is affiliated with the United\\nStates Department of Agriculture (USDA), investigated\\nthe role of boron in brain and psychological function in\\nseveral studies involving humans and animals. In one\\nstudy, increasing boron intake in rats receiving a boron-\\ndeficient diet seemed to increase mental activity. Studies\\nconducted in people suggested that a lack of boron can\\ndecrease mental activity and have a negative effect on\\nhand-eye coordination, the ability to concentrate, and\\nshort-term memory. These findings seem to indicate an\\nimportant role for boron in keeping the brain fit.\\nThe use of boron by body builders stems from its\\napparent ability to increase testosterone levels. Because\\ntestosterone is known to play an important role in the\\ndevelopment of muscles, some weight lifters have taken\\nboron supplements because they believe it will increase\\nlevels of male hormone and make them stronger. There\\nis no evidence, however, that boron can increase muscle\\nmass or athletic performance.

The estimated dosage of boron, which\\nis available as an over-the-counter dietary supplement, is\\ngenerally 3 mg a day. Even without taking supplements,\\nmost people get anywhere from 1–3 mg of boron through\\ntheir diets. For this reason, some authorities suggest avoid-\\ning boron supplements altogether and eating foods known\\nto contain the mineral.

Botanical medicine\\nincludes medical herbalism, a healing art that relies on\\nthe synergistic and curative properties of plants to treat\\nsymptoms and disease and maintain health, and phar-\\nmocognosy, the study of natural products. Botanical\\nmedicine is an important component of numerous tradi-\\ntional medical systems and therapies, including tradi-\\ntional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurvedic medicine,\\nnaturopathy, indigenous and shamanic medicine, home-\\nopathy, flower essence therapy, and aromatherapy .\\nBotanical medicine has survived for many thousands of\\nyears in some form and in all cultures throughout the\\nworld. The study of the plant lore of these various cul-\\ntures is known as ethnobotany.\\nPlants have been used since prehistoric times as med-\\nicinal remedies applied in various ways to provide relief\\nfrom irritations as minor as a mosquito bite to situations as\\ncatastrophic as the plague. In modern medicine, some\\ndrugs are derived from plants, and many of these medi-\\ncines are used in ways that are similar to their traditional\\nuses. Many more drugs in modern medicine, however, are\\nsynthetic, and part of the reason for this trend is economic:\\nplants can rarely be patented, so a pharmaceutical compa-\\nny will not gain the exclusive right to sell a plant-derived\\nmedication even after expensive research and marketing.\\nAlso, the processing of plants into a medicine cannot be as\\neasily standardized and controlled as the manufacturing of\\na synthetic. As a result, the efficacy and safety of only a\\nrelative few of the traditionally used botanical remedies\\nhave been verified by clinical research. Approximately\\nonly 5,000 of the estimated 500,000 known species (in-\\ncluding subspecies) of plants have been identified and\\nstudied for their medicinal properties.\\nOrigins\\nThe knowledge of the healing properties of herbs\\nhas been preserved from the time of the clay tablets of\\nthe ancient Sumerians over 5,000 years ago, to the sa-\\ncred texts and pharmacopoeias of the Hindu and Chinese\\ncultures, to the works of Greek and Roman physicians\\npreserved by Byzantine scholars, to the European folk\\nherbalists and physicians such as Nicholas Culpeper and,\\nmore recently, to the Native American herbalists. One of\\nthe earliest records of botanical medicine is the Pen\\nT’Shao Kang Mu , a work attributed to China’s Yellow\\nEmperor around 2500 B.C. Another is the Ebers papyrus,\\nan Egyptian medical text dating from 1,550 B.C. The Rig-\\nveda, an ancient Hindu scripture, lists more than 1,000\\nmedicinal plants used in the ancient Ayurveda system of\\nmedicine, already well developed by 1000 B.C.\\nTheophrastus, who lived from 327–285 B.C. is consid-\\nered the first scientific botanist; he recorded the use of\\nmore than 500 medicinal plants. The Greek physician\\nDioscorides produced what has been called the first true\\nherbal text, or herbal, the De materia medica in the first\\ncentury A.D. By the Middle Ages, the monks in medieval\\nEuropean monasteries were working to preserve this an-\\ncient knowledge by copying texts and cultivating exten-\\nsive gardens of medicinal plants. European folk medi-\\ncine was passed from generation to generation through\\noral tradition, and later, with the introduction of the\\nprinting press, the information became more widely\\navailable in popular written texts. Colonists brought their\\nherbal knowledge and plant specimens to settlements in\\nNorth America and learned from the indigenous Ameri-\\ncans how to make use of numerous additional plants na-\\ntive to the New World. The first record of Native Ameri-\\ncan herb use is the manuscript of the Native Mexican\\nphysician Juan Badianus in 1552.\\nThe use of herbs for medicinal purposes has been de-\\nveloped over the centuries by personal experimentation,\\nlocal custom, anecdote, and folk tradition. According to\\nthe World Health Organization, an estimated 80% of the\\nglobal population continues to rely on medicinal plant\\npreparations to meet primary health care needs. For exam-\\nple, a 2003 study found that traditional Arabic herbal med-\\nicine is still practiced in the Middle East.

Herbal remedies usually have a much\\nslower effect than pharmaceutical drugs. Some herbal\\nremedies have a cumulative effect and work slowly over\\ntime to restore balance, others are indicated for short-\\nterm treatment of acute symptoms. Botanical medicine\\nmay be especially beneficial when administered to help\\nwith chronic ongoing symptoms.\\nDescription\\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM): This system of\\nhealing employs ancient techniques, developed over\\nmany thousands of years. For example, among TCM’s\\ntechniques are acupuncture , moxibustion , and herbal\\nformulas to restore health. Moxibustion is a process that\\ncombines acupuncture with the traditional application of\\nthe herb mugwort, Artemisia vulgaris, known as Ai ye or\\nHao-shu. This is a method of heating specific acupunc-\\nture points on the body to treat physical conditions, par-\\nticularly chronic pain. When burnt, the mugwort pro-\\nduces a mild heat able to penetrate deeply into the mus-\\ncle. TCM also employs specific herbal formulas to re-\\nstore health and maintain a dynamic balance between two\\ndistinct forces known as yin and yang, particularly with\\nregard to the qi. Qi is the vital energy flowing along the\\nmeridians or energy pathways of the body. The TCM\\npractitioner is a skilled observer, who relies on diagnostic\\ntechniques, including measuring pulse rate from several\\npositions, and noting the general appearance of the pa-\\ntient, such as complexion, eyes, nails, hair, tongue, and\\nposture. The assessment not only includes consideration\\nof the patient’s symptomatic complaints, but of numerous\\npersonal characteristics including family history,\\nlifestyle, emotional health, environment, diet, and exer-\\ncise. The medicinal herbs prescribed are usually prepared\\nas a formula based on the unique needs of each patient.\\nAyurvedic medicine: This system of healing, literal-\\nly meaning the science of life or longevity, has been\\npracticed in India for more than 5,000 years. Ayurvedic\\nmedicine is concerned equally with the body, mind, and\\nspirit of the person and combines natural therapies to re-\\nstore balance and harmony. Ayurvedic physicians, like\\nthe practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine, use ed-\\nucated observation in diagnosis. In Ayurvedic medicine,\\nthere are three basic doshas, or metabolic body types.\\nThe success of Ayurvedic treatment depends on the prop-\\ner diagnosis of imbalances in these characteristic as-\\npects. Ayurvedic medicine emphasizes self-care strate-\\ngies such as a healthy diet,yoga, meditation, breathing,\\nand exercises to restore the innate harmony of the body.\\nTaste is an important indicator of the medicinal proper-\\nties of an herb. Plants are categorized according to six\\nplant essences: sweet, sour, salty, pungent, bitter, and as-\\ntringent. An understanding of how these plant essences\\nact in the body is a necessary component in Ayurvedic\\nmedicine for prescribing herbal remedies.\\nIndigenous and shamanic medicine: These rely on\\nextensive folk knowledge of botanical and animal medi-\\ncine combined with ceremonial ritual in the treatment of\\ndisease. The particular form of indigenous medicine is\\nunique to each tribe. The specific herbal remedies are\\nprimarily passed on through oral tradition.\\nNaturopathy: Naturopathic medicine was estab-\\nlished in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The\\nnaturopathic doctor, or naturopath, uses gentle methods\\nto boost the body’s healing, including nutritional supple-\\nments, herbal remedies, proper diet, and exercise to re-\\nstore health. The doctor works with the patient to edu-\\ncate him or her on ways to restore and maintain a healthy\\nbalance in the internal environment that will prevent fur-\\nther illness. Licensed naturopathic doctors pass rational\\nexams that include basic clinical botanical medicine\\ncompetency, as well as homeopathy.\\nHomeopathy: Homeopathy was founded in the late\\neighteenth century by the German physician Samuel\\nHahnemann. Homeopathy embraces the philosophy of\\n“like cures like.” Homeopathy uses extremely dilute so-\\nlutions of herbs, animal products, and chemicals that are\\nbelieved to hold a “trace memory” or energetic imprint\\nof the substance used. Sold as over-the-counter medi-\\ncine, homeopathic remedies are exempt from govern-\\nment regulations applied to pharmaceuticals. Homeo-\\npathic remedies may be sold without proof of safety and\\nefficacy as long as they are labeled with the directions\\nfor use and the level of dilution.\\nFlower essences: The use of flower essences at-\\ntempts to address a more subtle energy beyond the phys-\\nical symptoms, to treat the emotional and mental roots of\\ndisease. The English physician Edward Bach developed\\na method of extracting what he considered the essence of\\nflowers with the ability to address a broad range of psy-\\nchological conditions of the human spirit. This system\\nbecame known as Bach flower remedies. This botanical\\ntherapy attempts to match the energetic essence of par-\\nticular flowers with the same energy in the higher self of\\nan individual, thus strengthening the higher energies and\\npromoting self-realization and restoring health.

Herbs have long been\\nvalued for their healing fragrance. In 1564 an alchemist\\nnamed Giovanni Battista della Porta wrote about meth-\\nods used to separate essential oils from the aromatic dis-\\ntilled waters that had been used in previous centuries.\\nModern-day aromatherapy was developed by the French\\nchemist Réné-Maurice Gattefosse, in 1937. Aromathera-\\npy identifies the distinct healing properties of various\\npure essential oils. The small size of the molecules in es-\\nsential oils enables the chemicals to penetrate bodily tis-\\nsue easily and to act rapidly on the limbic system which\\nis believed to be the seat of emotions.\\nPreparations\\nThe quality of any herbal remedy and the chemical\\nconstituents found in the herb depends greatly on the\\nconditions of weather and the soil where the herb was\\ngrown, the timing and care in harvesting, and the manner\\nof preparation and storage. Herbs are prepared in a vari-\\nety of ways depending on the part of the plant that is\\nmedicinally active and the results sought. The list of\\nkinds of herbal preparations is long and varied. Some of\\nthese preparations include:\\n• Infusion. Infusion is appropriate for extracting medici-\\nnal properties of the leaf, flower, and stem of the plant.\\nEither fresh or dried herb may be used. A standard in-\\nfusion combines 1 tsp of dried herb, or 2 tsp of\\nchopped fresh herb, per cup of water. Fresh, nonchlori-\\nnated water is brought to the boiling point in a non-\\nmetallic pot, and the herbs are added. A cover prevents\\nthe escape of volatile oils. The tea is infused for 10 to\\n15 minutes, strained, and can be consumed warm or\\ncold. The prepared tea will keep up to two days in the\\nrefrigerator.\\n• Decoction. Decoction is the best method to extract the\\nmineral salts and other healing components from the\\ncoarser herb materials, such as the root, bark, seeds, and\\nstem of the plant. One ounce of the dried plant materi-\\nals, or 2 oz of fresh plant parts, is added to 1 pt of pure,\\nunchlorinated water in a non-metallic pot. The mixture\\nis brought to a boil, and then the heat is lowered, so the\\nmixture can simmer for about 30 minutes. After strain-\\ning and covering, a decoction may be refrigerated for up\\nto two days and retain its healing qualities.\\n• Tincture. Tincture is a method to prepare a concentrat-\\ned form of the fresh herbal remedy for therapeutic use.\\nThese solutions, properly prepared and stored, will re-\\ntain medicinal potency for many years. To prepare a\\ntincture, a clean glass container is packed with chopped\\nfresh or dried herb, and enough good quality brandy or\\nvodka to cover is poured over the herb. The\\nalcohol/water ratio varies, dependent on the plant and\\nthe intended extract. The concentration (depending on\\nthe herb) is 25-90%; often the ratio of alcohol to water\\nis about 50/50. The container then needs to be sealed\\nwith an airtight lid. The mixture needs to be left in a\\ndarkened place to steep for two weeks, and shaken\\ndaily. After straining the mixture through a cheesecloth\\nor muslin bag and pouring it into a dark bottle for stor-\\nage, it is ready for use. Dosage depends on the herb and\\nits designated use. A standard dosage is 2–4 ml of the\\ntincture three times a day. Other fluid extracts may be\\nprepared with glycerine or vinegar.\\n• Capsule. A capsule is a convenient form for ingesting\\ndried, powdered herbs, usually contained in a gelatin\\ncapsule. Gelatin capsules are available in the standard\\nsize 00 which holds 200–250 mg of powdered herb.\\nPrepared capsules should be stored in dark glass con-\\ntainers.\\n• Oil infusion. With this method, the chopped fresh or\\ndried herb is placed in a glass storage container. Enough\\ncold-pressed vegetable oil, such as sunflower or olive\\noil, is poured into the jar to cover the herb completely.\\nThis mixture is sealed and placed on a sunny windowsill\\nfor two or three weeks. The infused oil is strained into\\nanother jar of the chopped fresh or dried herb. This mix-\\nture steeps on a sunny windowsill for another two\\nweeks. After being strained through cheesecloth, this in-\\nfused oil can be stored in a cool, dark location.\\n• Ointments. These are prepared with powdered or fresh-\\nly chopped plant parts combined with melted petrole-\\num jelly or beeswax and vegetable oil. The mixture is\\nsimmered in a double boiler for about two hours. The\\nmixture is strained through cheesecloth and poured into\\nsmall glass storage containers. Ointments provide a\\nspreadable consistency and protective layer for topical\\napplication of medicinal herbs to the skin.\\n• Poultice. A poultice is a hot mixture of the chopped\\nfresh or dry herb that has been boiled briefly, and\\ncooled to a tolerable temperature before application to\\nthe affected area. A small amount of oil should be ap-\\nplied to the skin prior to placing the poultice to prevent\\nthe herb from sticking. The poultice can be covered\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2286\\nBotanical medicine\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 286'),\n",

The poultice can\\nbe refreshed every two or three hours as needed.\\n• Essential oils. This is the highly concentrated extract of\\nan herb obtained through steam distillation or cold\\ncompress methods. Essential oils should be diluted in\\nwater or in a nontoxic carrier oil before application to\\nthe skin to prevent contact dermatitis or sensitization.\\nEssential oils are used for topical application, in bath\\nwater, and in aromatherapy. The toxicity of the concen-\\ntrated essential oil varies depending on the chemical\\nconstituents of the herb.\\nThe above list is by no means exhaustive. There are\\nmany other botanical medicine preparations available.\\nPrecautions\\nHerbal remedies prepared by infusion, decoction, or\\nalcohol tincture from the appropriate plant part, such as\\nthe leaf, root, or flower are generally safe when ingested\\nin properly designated therapeutic dosages. However,\\nmany herbs have specific contraindications for use when\\ncertain medical conditions are present and by pregnant\\nor lactating women. Some herbs are toxic, even deadly,\\nin large amounts, and there is little research on the\\nchronic toxicity that may result from prolonged use.\\nHerbal remedies are sold in the United States as dietary\\nsupplements and are not regulated by the Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) for content or efficacy. Self-diag-\\nnosis and treatment with botanical medicinals may be\\nrisky. A consultation with a certified clinical herbalist or\\nnaturopathic physician is prudent before undertaking a\\ncourse of treatment. A 2002 report said that patients\\noften fail to inform their physicians about herbal prod-\\nucts they are using, and that patients don’t think of them\\nas medicines. Yet many botanical remedies can interact\\nwith allopathic medicines and either cancel their effects\\nor cause adverse effects. For example,garlic, ginseng,\\nginkgo, feverfew, licorice, and other common remedies\\nhave anticoagulant properties that can put patients as risk\\nof bleeding during surgery.\\nAdvances in communication technology have made\\nwarnings about herbal remedies more important than\\never. The Internet includes many sites with unregulated\\nand often unhealthful advice about use of herbal reme-\\ndies. Many herbalists and allopathic physicians urge pa-\\ntients to use caution when seeking information on herbal\\ntreatments on the Internet. One cancer-related study\\nfound that only 36% of the web sites found in a search\\noffered information that complied with regulatory guide-\\nlines regarding unsubstantiated claims about treatment or\\ncure of disease.\\nEssential oils should not be taken internally without\\nexpert guidance due to the potential for toxicity even in\\nvery small amounts. They are not to be used in any form\\nby pregnant or lactating women without competent med-\\nical consultation. Essential oil extracts do not contain the\\nfull range of phytochemicals present in the whole plant.\\nHomeopathic remedies are safe because of their ex-\\ntremely dilute nature. These remedies must not be relied\\nupon for treatment of any serious illness or injury. If symp-\\ntoms persist, other qualified medical help should be sought.\\nSide effects\\nHerbs contain numerous phytochemicals formed in\\nthe metabolic process of the plant. These chemicals act\\non the body in different ways; some of these act on the\\nwhole body, while some act on a specific organ or sys-\\ntem. An herb’s effect may be due to a particular chemical\\nin the herb, or it may be due to an interaction among\\nconstituents within the plant. Interactions with other\\nherbs, or with pharmacological drugs, is a matter of con-\\ncern and a growing area of research.\\nThe pure essential oils of aromatic plants, extracted\\nby steam distillation or cold pressing techniques have\\nbeen used for more than a century in medicines, food,\\ndrink, perfumes, detergents, soaps, cosmetics, in various\\nindustrial applications, and in aromatherapy. Some com-\\npounds found in plant oils can cause sensitization even\\nin very small amounts. Side effects from external appli-\\ncation of some essential oils may include mild skin irri-\\ntation, such as itching and burning; sensitization, which\\nmay lead to recurrent mild to severe adverse reactions\\nsuch as burning and rash each time the essential oil is\\nused; and phototoxicity, a situation in which certain es-\\nsential oils react with ultraviolet light and cause reac-\\ntions from mild skin blotching to severe burning any\\ntime the skin is exposed to sunlight.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nBotanical treatments are generally accepted as part\\nof mainstream medical treatment around the world ex-\\ncept in the United States, where herbal remedies are sold\\nas dietary supplements. As of 2003, the branch of the\\nFDA that regulates botanical products under the rubric of\\ndietary supplements is the Center for Food Safety and\\nApplied Nutrition (CFSAN). Under the Dietary Supple-\\nment Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), the\\nmanufacturer of a botanical preparation is responsible\\nfor ensuring that it is safe before marketing it; the FDA\\nis responsible for taking legal action if the product\\nproves to be unsafe after it is marketed. The other gov-\\nernment agency that has some oversight over botanical\\npreparations in the United States is the National Center\\nfor Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 287\\nBotanical medicine\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 287'),\n",

When a woman lives to be 85, there is\\na one out of nine chance that she will develop the condi-\\ntion sometime during the rest of her life. As a woman\\nages, her risk of developing breast cancer rises dramati-\\ncally regardless of her family history. The breast cancer\\nrisk of a 25-year-old woman is only one out of 19,608;\\nby age 45, it is one in 93. In fact, 80% of all breast can-\\ncers are found in women over age 50.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThere are a number of risk factors for the develop-\\nment of breast cancer, including:\\n• family history of breast cancer in mother or sister\\n• early onset of menstruation and late menopause\\n• reproductive history (women who had no children or\\nhave children late in life and women who have never\\nbreastfed have increased risk)\\n• history of abnormal breast biopsies\\nHowever, more than 70% of women who get breast\\ncancer have no known risk factors. While a breast cancer\\ngene was discovered in 1994, only about 5% of breast\\ncancers are believed to be related to the gene.\\nIn addition, some studies suggest that high fat diets,\\nbottle feeding instead of breastfeeding, or consuming al-\\ncohol may contribute to the risk profile. Other aspects of\\nnutritionand lifestyle in Western countries may be re-\\nsponsible for higher rates of breast cancer in our soci-\\neties. For example, aromatic hydrocarbons in tobacco\\nand certain hydrocarbons in well-done meat may act as\\ncarcinogens. While some studies had suggested a link\\nbetween hormone replacement therapies (HRTs) con-\\ntributing to breast cancer, many did not take them seri-\\nously. However, a landmark study released in 2003\\nproved the risk was greater than thought. The Women’s\\nHealth Initiative found that even relatively short-term\\nuse of estrogen plus progestin is associated with in-\\ncreased risk of breast cancer, diagnosis at a more ad-\\nvanced stage of the disease, and a higher number of ab-\\nnormal mammograms. The longer a woman used HRT,\\nthe more her risk increased.\\nIt is important to realize that not all lumps detected\\nin the breast are cancerous.

Reproduced by per-\\nmission.)\\nCancer Society guidelines that recommend screening\\nmammograms every year or two for women between 40\\nand 49, and every year after age 50. Women with a fami-\\nly history of breast cancer may want to have a mammo-\\ngram every year after age 40.\\nA typical mammography screening includes two\\nviews of each breast (one from above, and one from the\\nside). Normally, the technologist examines the x-ray\\nfilms immediately to make sure views are complete. A\\nradiologist determines if further views or follow-up ul-\\ntrasound studies are needed.\\nIf anything irregular is detected, such as a mass,\\nchanges from earlier mammograms, abnormalities of the\\nskin, or enlargement of the lymph nodes, further testing\\nmay be recommended. This could include an ultrasound\\nof the breast, a biopsy or needle sampling, or consulta-\\ntion with a breast surgeon.\\nBiopsy of the breast is a removal of breast tissue for\\nexamination by a pathologist. An excisional biopsy is a\\nsurgical procedure in which the entire lump area and\\nsome surrounding tissue is removed for examination. If\\nthe mass is very large, an incisional biopsy is done\\nwhere only a portion of the area is removed and ana-\\nlyzed. Needle biopsy can be done in two methods. An\\naspiration needle biopsy uses a very fine needle to with-\\ndraw cells and fluid from the mass for analysis. A large\\ncore needle biopsy uses a larger diameter needle to re-\\nmove small pieces of tissue from the mass that can be\\nanalyzed. These analyses can determine whether the\\nmass is benign (noncancerous) or cancerous and there-\\nfore, whether further treatment is required.\\nTo find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of\\nthe body (metastasized), doctors remove some underarm\\nlymph nodes to test for cancer cells that have spread and\\nto assist in making decisions for treatment. A newer\\ntechnique, called sentinel lymph node biopsy, allows\\nphysicians to check the sentinel node, or the one that\\nfirst receives fluid drained from the cancerous area, to\\npreserve as many lymph nodes as possible. If this node is\\nfree of cancer cells, the cancer should not have spread\\nany further than locally. Checking to see if there are can-\\ncer cells in the lymph nodes is also a way to tell how ad-\\nvanced the cancer is (“staging” cancer). Breast cancer is\\nrated from Stage 0 to Stage IV . Staging uses the diagnos-\\ntic information to tell the cancer physician (oncologist)\\nhow widespread the disease is and includes:\\n• Stage I. The cancer is no larger than 2 cm and no can-\\ncer cells are found in the lymph nodes.\\n• Stage II. The cancer is no larger than 2 cm but has\\nspread to the lymph nodes or is larger than 2 cm but has\\nnot spread to the lymph nodes.\\nonly the removal of the lump. While having several risk\\nfactors may boost a woman’s chances of having breast\\ncancer, the interplay of factors is complex. The best way\\nto assess breast cancer risk is by doing monthly self ex-\\naminations to detect any lump at an early stage. The sec-\\nond is to have a regular mammogram, an x ray of the\\nfront and side of the breast that will detect cysts or tu-\\nmors at the earliest possible stage. Seeking risk assess-\\nment consultation at one of the many breast cancer cen-\\nters located throughout the United States is also helpful.\\nChanges in the breast that may indicate breast can-\\ncer include:\\n• lump or thickening in breast or armpit\\n• changes in a nipple (thickening, pulling in, bleeding, or\\ndischarge)\\n• dimpled or reddened skin over the breast\\n• change in size or shape\\n• abnormality on a mammogram\\nDiagnosis\\nMore than 90% of all breast cancers are detected by\\nmammogram (a low-dose x ray of the breast).

Once the pain can be visualized, the pa-\\ntient can adjust the image to make it more pleasing, and\\nthus more manageable, to them.\\nA number of herbal remedies are also available to\\nlessen pain symptoms and chemotherapy side effects, and\\nto promote relaxation and healing. However, breast can-\\ncer patients should consult with their healthcare profes-\\nsional before taking them. Depending on the preparation\\nand the type of herb, these remedies may interact with or\\nenhance the effects of other prescribed medications.\\nResults of a clinical trial performed at the National\\nCancer Institute of Milan, Italy, have indicated that home-\\nopathic remedies of belladonna (Atropa belladonna) can\\nbe useful in relieving the discomfort, warmth, and\\nswelling of the skin associated with radiotherapy for\\nbreast cancer (i.e., radiodermatitis). As with all homeo-\\npathic remedies, the prescription of belladonna depends\\non an individual’s overall symptom picture, mood, and\\ntemperament, and should be prepared by a trained home-\\nopathic professional. When used as a homeopathic reme-\\ndy, belladonna is administered in a highly diluted form to\\ntrigger the body’s natural healing response without risk of\\nbelladonna poisoning or overdose. There are many other\\nherbs that help in relieving the nausea that accompanies\\nchemotherapy, including ginger (Zingiber officinale).\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment options include surgery, chemotherapy,\\nand radiation. Breast cancer is treated in two ways: lo-\\ncally to eliminate tumor cells from the breast by surgery\\nand radiation, and to systemically destroy cancer cells\\nthat have traveled to other parts of the body. Systemic\\ntherapy includes the use of drugs in chemotherapy and\\nhormonal treatments to reduce the amount of estrogen\\ncirculating in the blood.\\nSurgery\\nThe extent of surgery depends on the type of breast\\ncancer, whether the disease has spread, and the patient’s\\nage and health. If the tumor is less than about 1.6 in (4.1\\ncm) or there is not much chance it will return, then the\\npatient and doctor may opt for removal of the tumor\\nalone (lumpectomy) followed by radiation therapy.\\nStudies have shown that conservative treatment (a\\nlumpectomy or partial mastectomy) offers the same odds\\nof survival as does removal of the entire breast (total\\nmastectomy) in someone with a small breast tumor that\\nhas not spread into the nearby lymph nodes.

Recent studies also show that breast\\nconserving surgery leads to better quality of life follow-\\ning breast cancer for women of all ages.\\nIf the tumor is larger, a total (or simple) mastectomy\\nmay be needed. If the cancer has spread to the chest\\nmuscles, most doctors believe a radical mastectomy is\\nthe best solution. This operation is now used only when\\nthe cancer has spread to the chest muscle.\\nIn a lumpectomy, the doctor removes:\\n• the lump\\n• some of the tissue around the lump\\n• some of the lymph nodes under the arm may be re-\\nmoved (auxillary dissection) and tested to see if the\\ncancer has spread there\\nEven if no cancer is found in the nodes, radiation al-\\nways follows lumpectomy and treatment may include\\nchemotherapy.\\nIn a modified radical mastectomy, the doctor re-\\nmoves:\\n• the entire breast\\n• the underarm lymph nodes\\n• the lining over the chest muscle (but not the muscles\\nthemselves)\\nA radical mastectomy is almost never done, but if\\nnecessary the doctor removes:\\n• the breast\\n• the chest muscles\\n• all of the lymph nodes under the arm\\nSurgery can be combined with breast reconstruction\\n(creating a new breast-shaped mound), either right away\\nor later on. Patients who want breast reconstruction\\nshould tell the doctor before surgery, since this could\\nchange the way the surgeon operates.\\nRemoving the tumor and a border of normal tissue\\naround it will remove the cancer while saving most of\\nthe breast tissue. However, the longer a tumor has been\\ngrowing in the breast, the more likely it will be that the\\ncancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes. These\\nnodes under the arm or in the chest are a common place\\nfor breast cancer cells to spread. During surgery, some of\\nthe nodes are removed to check for cancer cells.\\nThe presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes\\nmay require more extensive surgery. If the cancer has\\nspread to the nodes, the patient will need either radiation,\\nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of all\\nthree after surgery. This is called “adjuvant therapy.”\\nRadiation\\nOnce the cancer has been removed, the doctor may\\nrecommend radiation to destroy or shrink any remaining\\nbreast cancer cells. Radiation stops the cancer cells from\\ndividing. It works especially well on fast-growing tu-\\nmors. Unfortunately, it also stops some types of healthy\\ncells from dividing. Healthy cells that divide quickly,\\nlike those of the skin and hair, are affected the most. This\\nis why radiation can cause fatigue , skin problems, and\\nhair loss.\\nChemotherapy\\nBreast cancer surgery may be followed by chemo-\\ntherapy in even the earliest stages. Chemotherapy is ad-\\nministered either orally or by injection into a blood ves-\\nsel. It is usually given in cycles, followed by a period of\\ntime for recovery, followed by another course of drugs.\\nTreatment time may range between four to nine months.\\nThere may be significant side effects with some\\ntypes of chemotherapy, including nausea and vomiting,\\ntemporary hair loss, mouth or vaginal sores, fatigue,\\nweakened immune system, and infertility . However,\\nchemotherapy for early breast cancer uses medications\\nthat cause fewer side effects.\\nHormone therapy\\nThe growth of some breast cancer cells may be\\nslowed by the drug tamoxifen, an anti-estrogen medica-\\ntion. Given each day as a pill, tamoxifen travels through-\\nout the bloodstream, slowing or stopping cancer cell\\ngrowth. Tamoxifen treatment lasts at least two years, and\\noften as long as five.

Odle\\nBreast-feeding problems\\nDefinition\\nThe term “breast-feeding problems” is used to de-\\nscribe a variety of physical, behavioral, and emotional\\ndifficulties with nursing an infant.\\nDescription\\nBreast-feeding, or nursing, is the practice of nour-\\nishing an infant with the milk in the human breast. Full-\\nterm babies have a natural suckling instinct, and breast-\\nfeeding comes naturally to most as soon as they leave the\\nwomb. After delivery, levels of prolactin, the hormone\\nthat triggers milk product, begin to rise in the body. At\\nfirst, babies feed on a nutrient-rich substance known as\\ncolostrum, which is produced by the breast before milk\\nproduction begins. New mothers will experience en-\\ngorgement in the days following the birth of their babies,\\nwhere breast milk “comes in” and engorges the breasts.\\nAfter this time, regular feedings and proper breast-feed-\\ning techniques usually ensure a healthy milk supply for\\nmost babies until it is time to wean. However, breast-\\nfeeding can be a complex process and in many cases,\\nthere is a problem with the infant’s suckling technique,\\nthe mother’s milk supply, or other factors, and breast-\\nfeeding problems result.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nInadequate weight gain and a failure to thrive in\\nnursing infants is the most obvious sign that there is a\\nbreast-feeding problem.\\nA number of factors may interfere with successful\\nbreast-feeding. These include:\\n• Milk supply problems. A variety of factors can cause\\nan inadequate supply in new mothers. Milk production\\nis largely a supply and demand process. If the baby\\ndoes not feed frequently enough, milk production will\\nadjust itself, going down accordingly. A study pub-\\nlished in 2002 showed that women who gave birth to a\\nsecond child within two years of the birth of their first\\nchild produced about 30 percent more breast milk in\\nthe first week after birth with their second baby.\\n• Latching problems. Some babies, particularly preterm\\ninfants, have difficulty suckling. This can be due to an\\nabnormality of the mouth, or simply to a lack of coor-\\ndination of the jaw muscles. In addition, the mother\\nmay not be placing her breast into the infant’s mouth\\nproperly.\\n• Scheduling problems. Breastfed infants should be\\nnursed at least once every three hours during the day,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2294\\nBreast-feeding problems\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 294'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 312}, page_content='and should go no more than five hours at night between\\nfeedings. Scheduling also becomes a problem for\\nwomen who work outside the home, as they often find\\nthat their milk flow diminishes after they return to work.\\n• Nipple and breast problems. Infants may have difficulty\\nlatching on to inverted or flat nipples. Other structural\\nproblems such as insufficient mammary glandular tis-\\nsue, may result in reduced milk production. In addition,\\ncracked and sore nipples and breast infections (masti-\\ntis) can make nursing painful.\\n• Retained placenta. If a woman’s milk has not “come\\nin” and she continues to experience abnormal bleeding\\nafter delivery, she may still be retaining pieces of the\\nplacenta within her uterus.\\n• Stomach sleeping. A nursing mother who sleeps on her\\nstomach may experience decreased milk production\\ndue to the extended pressure on her breasts.\\n• Stress and fatigue . New mothers need proper rest in\\norder to produce an adequate milk supply. The ability\\nto relax is also fundamental to proper breast-feeding.\\nWomen who are stressed can have difficulty achieving\\nmilk “let-down,” the sensation of the mammary glands\\nreleasing milk.\\n• Psychological issues. Some women are unable to\\nbreastfeed because of preconceived notions about the\\npractice, or ideas instilled by their parents and peers,\\nthat have put up a psychological barrier for them. A\\n2002 study showed that most women are uncomfort-\\nable breast feeding in public and may even abandon the\\npractice because they don’t want to be shut off from\\nothers or feel squeamish about feeding their babies\\neven in front of friends and family members.\\nDiagnosis\\nBreast-feeding problems are first determined by an\\ninfant’s inability to gain weight. Most babies lose some\\nweight in the first week of life. However, they should re-\\ngain the weight quickly and be back at their birthweight\\nat two weeks of age. An average weight gain of 6–8 oz\\nper week should be maintained through the second or\\nthird month. After that, growth charts can demonstrate\\nwhether the child is gaining adequate weight.\\nOnce a problem has been established, a healthcare\\npractitioner will ask questions about the baby’s feeding\\nschedule and may observe the mother’s breast-feeding\\ntechnique so he or she can determine if an improper latch-\\ning technique or inadequate suckling is causing the diffi-\\nculty. Lactation counselors can be helpful in diagnosing\\nthese problems. Further physical examination and tests\\nmay be necessary to determine if structural breast prob-\\nlems or placental fragments are causing the difficulties.\\nTreatment\\nProper treatment for breast-feeding difficulties de-\\npends on the cause of the problem.\\nInadequate milk production\\nMilk production can be boosted in several ways. The\\neasiest way is for the mother to encourage more frequent\\nfeedings at the breast. If this is impractical or the baby does\\nnot cooperate, milk production can often be increased\\nthrough intermittent use of a breast pump, a device that ex-\\npresses milk from the breast. Breast pumps are available in\\nmanual and electric models, and can be purchased or rent-\\ned. Pumped breast milk can be bottled or frozen, and fed\\nby bottle to the baby at a later time, although if milk pro-\\nduction is a problem the mother will probably want to put\\nthe baby to the breast at every opportunity.\\nMilk thistle,( Silybum marianum) is sometimes pre-\\nscribed to promote increased breast milk secretion. Al-\\nthough the herb is considered safe for nursing mothers, it\\nshould be acquired from a reputable source and pre-\\nscribed by an herbalist, naturopathic physician, or other\\nhealthcare professional familiar with its use.\\nEach breast contains both foremilk and the richer,\\nfat laden hindmilk. Infants need the nutrients and fat of\\nthe hind milk, but must get through the foremilk to reach\\nit. This is why it is important that the mother completely\\nempty one breast before starting the baby on the other\\none. This can be accomplished by nursing at least 10\\nminutes per breast. If the baby does not completely\\nempty a breast, the job can be finished with the aid of a\\nbreast pump. The next time the mother nurses, she\\nshould start the child on the opposite breast.\\nLatching problems\\nTo ensure proper breast-feeding, the mother should en-\\ncourage the baby to latch on to the entire nipple, with his or\\nher lips past the outside perimeter of the areola, before start-\\ning to suck. The mother will likely have to guide the breast\\ninto the baby’s mouth, and repositioning may be required.\\nPractice makes perfect, and sometimes all an infant\\nneeds to improve his latching and suckling technique is\\ntime. If the baby has a structural problem in his mouth,\\nsuch as a cleft palate, a breast pump may be required to\\nkeep milk production going. In some cases where suck-\\nling does not improve, feeding with a supplementary nu-\\ntrition system may be required. The system consists of a\\nfeeding bottle containing the mother’s own breast-\\npumped milk, and two tubes that run down from the bot-\\ntle and attach to the nipples. Milk flows easily from the\\ntubes with a weak sucking action from the baby. Both\\nbaby and mother can still maintain closeness while pro-\\nviding the baby with adequate milk flow.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 295\\nBreast-feeding problems\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 295'),\n",

They\\nshould go no longer than five hours at night without feeding,\\nand may require waking to ensure they get enough to eat.\\nWomen who have returned to work can use a\\nportable breast pump at least once during the work day\\nto encourage sustained milk flow and to store milk for\\ntheir babies to eat during their time away from home.\\nNipple and breast problems\\nLiquid vitamin E applied regularly to sore or\\ncracked nipples can soothe the pain and help the healing\\nprocess. Women who think they have a breast infection\\nshould see their healthcare provider immediately, as they\\nwill probably require a course of antibiotics.\\nRetained placenta\\nMinor surgery known as a dilatation and curettage\\n(D and C) is usually required to remove pieces of placen-\\nta that were retained by the uterus. Once the placenta has\\nbeen removed, prolactin levels should rise, stimulating\\nmilk production.\\nStress and fatigue\\nRelaxation exercises, yoga, meditation , massage,\\nand aromatherapy can all be useful tools for relieving\\nstress. Women should establish a quiet, restful environ-\\nment for nursing. Warm compresses to the breast may\\nalso assist in milk let down. If it is feasible, taking naps\\nwhen the baby is sleeping can help to ease the fatigue\\ncaused by nighttime feedings.\\nPsychological issues\\nSupport from family and friends is necessary for any\\nnew mother, especially one that chooses to nurse her child. If\\nno familiar support network exists, women may seek help\\nfrom groups for nursing mothers such as the LaLeche league.\\nMany hospitals offer mothers and their spouses\\nclasses on breast-feeding techniques and nursing issues.\\nWomen who have negative feelings about breast-feeding\\nmay find classes helpful in overcoming these issues.\\nExpected results\\nIn most cases, treatment for breast-feeding problems\\nis successful and mother and baby do well.

For a small\\npercentage of women, physical problems or psychologi-\\ncal issues may prevent successful nursing altogether.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way for a new mother to prevent nursing\\nproblems is to take care of herself by eating right, drinking\\nplenty of fluids, and staying rested and relaxed.

Patanjali, sometimes known as\\nthe “Father of Yoga,” codified yoga philosophy and tech-\\nnique in his Yoga Sutras , written sometime during the\\nlast several centuries of the pre-Christian era.\\nBreathwork\\nBreathwork refers to a number of different breath-\\nbased therapies, most of which have developed since the\\n1970s. Rebirthing, also known as intuitive breathing,\\nuses breathing techniques (in conjunction with affirma-\\ntions and other cognitive practices) as a form of psy-\\nchotherapy. The intent is for the person to reexperience\\nand release birth trauma and other emotional and psy-\\nchological blockages.\\nRelaxation response\\nDr. Herbert Benson of Harvard Medical School\\nbegan studying the physiological effects of breathing and\\nmeditationtechniques on the human body in the 1960s.\\nThis led him to pinpoint a specific psycho-physiological\\ncondition said to offer various therapeutic effects. In the\\n1970s, Benson founded the Mind/Body Medical Institute\\nat Harvard.\\nBenefits\\nMost breath therapies are commonly used both to\\npromote general well-being and to address specific psy-\\nchological, physical, and/or spiritual conditions. General\\nbenefits may include reduced stress, enhanced energy\\nand vitality, and (in the case of yoga and other similar\\npractices) increased flexibility. Breath therapies have\\nalso been used to treat a wide range of specific com-\\nplaints, such as asthma, high blood pressure, headaches,\\nand rheumatoid arthritis . Breathing exercises have\\nhelped some children avoid asthma attacks and improve\\nlung function. Breathing therapy has been used to help\\nreduce anger, exhaustion, hostility, and risk of new heart\\nproblems in some people who have had heart surgery.\\nYoga, in particular, is increasingly being used as a com-\\npanion therapy to conventional treatment for such criti-\\ncal illnesses as cancer, heart disease, and HIV/AIDS.\\nUsed as a form of psychotherapy, both breathwork\\nand meditation are said to help practitioners address old\\nconflicts, enhance their self-esteem, and achieve greater\\npeace of mind.\\nIn addition to these benefits, spiritual seekers may\\nexplore these therapies to achieve higher consciousness.\\nDescription\\nYoga\\nMost schools of yoga incorporate breathing exercis-\\nes (known as pranayama) as one key component, along\\nwith physical poses (asanas) and, sometimes, chanting\\nand/or sitting meditation. Perhaps the most basic form of\\npranayama is three-level breathing, in which the practi-\\ntioner first fills the abdomen, then the rib cage, and then\\nthe upper chest, before exhaling in reverse order. Anoth-\\ner breathing technique sometimes used in yogic practice\\nis alternate-nostril breathing, in which air is taken in\\nthrough one nostril and expelled through the other, often\\nusing the hand or a finger to close the unused nostril. A\\nmore intensive breathing technique, often associated\\nwith the kundalini school of yoga, is the breath of fire.\\nThis involves pumping the diaphragm to draw in and\\nexpel air rapidly. More advanced yogic practice may also\\ninvolve any number of other breathing techniques.\\nBreathwork\\nVarious types of breathwork employ a breathing\\ntechnique originally associated with rebirthing, known\\nas conscious (or circular) connected breath. This tech-\\nnique, performed lying down, involves a continuous\\ncycle of inhaling and exhaling air through the mouth.\\nThe person inhales as fully as possible and allows a nat-\\nural, relaxed exhale, with no pause between intake and\\nrelease. Holotropic breathwork uses deep and rapid\\nbreathing coordinated with dramatic sounds and rhythms\\nto induce psychedelic states.\\nRelaxation response\\nBased on his study of the effects of transcendental\\nmeditation (a popular approach brought to the West by\\nMaharishi Mahesh Yogi of India), Dr. Herbert Benson de-\\nveloped a nonreligious approach to meditation that com-\\nbines breathing techniques, sitting quietly, and focusing\\nthe mind in order to achieve the “relaxation response.”\\nPrecautions\\nMany breath therapies are intended to be practiced in\\na safe, controlled environment, under the guidance of a\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 297\\nBreath therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 297'),\n",

They are\\nbodywork, Self-Breema exercises, and the nine universal\\nprinciples of Breema.\\nBodywork\\nSince Breema regards the body as an energy system,\\nthe bodywork is intended “to enhance the flow of life en-\\nergy and bring one to the present.” A person receiving a\\nBreema treatment is fully clothed and works with the in-\\nstructor or practitioner lying down or seated on a padded\\nfloor. The bodywork is a harmonious choreography of\\nsupported movements, gradual leaning, gentle stretching\\nand bending, holding postures, “nurturing brushes,” and\\nrhythmic tapping.

It consists\\nof the ground, dried cells of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a\\none-celled plant that is a variety of fungus.\\nBrewer’s yeast contains all the essential amino\\nacids, 14 minerals, and 17 vitamins. It is one of the best\\nnatural sources of the B-complex vitamins thiamin, ri-\\nboflavin, niacin,B 6, pantothenic acid, biotin, and folic\\nacid. It is also high in minerals, including chromium ,\\nzinc, iron, phosphorus, and selenium. Brewer’s yeast is\\nalso a good source of protein. It contains approximately\\n16 g of protein per 30 g of powdered yeast. Brewer’s\\nyeast is a good source of RNA, an immune-enhancing\\nnucleic acid that may help in the prevention of degenera-\\ntive diseases and slowing the aging process.\\nGeneral use\\nVegetarians have used brewer’s yeast as a source of\\nprotein, vitamins, and minerals for many years. In addi-\\ntion to being an excellent nutritional supplement, brew-\\ner’s yeast is often recommended to regulate blood sugar\\nlevels, improve the health of the skin, control diarrhea,\\nlower cholesterol, and repel insects.\\nBrewer’s yeast is one of the best sources of the miner-\\nal chromium. Two tablespoons of brewer’s yeast yields\\nabout 120 micrograms (/H9262g) of chromium, an amount\\nequal to the recommended daily allowance. Chromium is\\nan important factor in regulating blood sugar levels. High\\nlevels of chromium increase glucose tolerance. Diabetes\\nand hypoglycemia are two conditions in which blood\\nsugar levels are unstable. Brewer’s yeast has been reported\\nto help improve symptoms of diabetes and hypoglycemia,\\nand may act to prevent diabetes from developing in per-\\nsons with a family history of diabetes and in those who\\nhave problems with blood sugar metabolism. One Danish\\nstudy reported that people with hypoglycemia showed an\\nimprovement in their symptoms after taking 2 tbsp of\\nbrewer’s yeast every day for one month.\\nB-complex vitamins are important for healthy skin\\nand nails. Persons deficient in these vitamins may bene-\\nfit from taking brewer’s yeast as it is rich in B-complex\\nvitamins. A compound derived from brewer’s yeast, skin\\nrespiratory factor (SRF) reportedly has wound healing\\nproperties. SRF has been a component in over-the-\\ncounter hemorrhoid remedies for more than four\\ndecades. SRF also has been used to treat skin problems.\\nBrewer’s yeast has been used in the treatment of contact\\ndermatitis, a condition of the skin characterized by red,\\nitchy, and inflamed skin.\\nAnother component of brewer’s yeast also has\\nwound healing properties. Glucan, a substance derived\\nfrom the yeast, has been shown to improve wound heal-\\ning in mice by activating macrophages and promoting\\nthe growth of skin cells and capillaries.\\nBrewer’s yeast may help to prevent constipation .\\nThirty grams of brewer’s yeast contains approximately\\n6 grams of dietary fiber (24% of the recommended\\ndaily amount). Fiber is an important part of the diet as\\nit helps increase the bulk of fecal matter, thereby pro-\\nmoting healthy bowels and intestines. Brewer’s yeast\\nhas also been found to be helpful in cases of diarrhea.\\nThe yeast acts to encourage the growth of good bacteria\\nin the intestines.\\nStudies show that brewer’s yeast may be helpful in\\ndecreasing cholesterol and raising HDL levels (the good\\ncholesterol). A study performed at Syracuse University\\nin New York reported that persons who consumed 2 tbsp\\nof brewer’s yeast daily for two months reduced their\\ncholesterol levels by 10%.\\nPet owners have known about the ability of brewer’s\\nyeast ability to repel ticks and fleas for many years.\\nWafers that contain brewer’s yeast can be given to ani-\\nmals for this purpose. Powdered brewer’s yeast may be\\nsprinkled on the animal’s food also. The large amounts\\nof thiamine in brewer’s yeast may act to repel mosqui-\\ntoes from humans as well.\\nGenerous doses of brewer’s yeast may help to pre-\\nvent cancers such as prostate cancer . When combined\\nwith wheat germ, brewer’s yeast is helpful in preventing\\nheart problems. Brewer’s yeast may also be helpful in\\nthe treatment of fatigue or low energy.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2300\\nBrewer’s yeast\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:28 PM  Page 300'),\n",

Some packaged brewer’s yeasts are\\nprocessed to remove the alcohol and/or chemical\\nbyproducts that may be left behind in the brewing\\nprocess. This processing phase lowers the nutritional\\nquality of the yeast. High quality brewer’s yeast is grown\\non molasses or sugar beets and is grown specifically for\\nsupplemental purposes.

Although the people of Guade-\\nloupe introduced Christopher Columbus to the fruit in 1493,\\nEuropeans did not recognize the pineapple’s beneficial at-\\ntributes until later. Pineapple had a long history of traditional\\nuse among the native peoples of Central and South America.\\nThey applied pineapple dressings to wounds and skin in-\\njuries to reduce inflammation, and eased stomachachesand\\nindigestionby drinking the juice of the fruit.\\nBromelain was first isolated from pineapple juice in\\n1891 and introduced as a therapeutic supplement in\\n1957. The active ingredients of bromelain are found in\\nthe juice and stem of the pineapple plant, but the stem\\ncontains more bromelain than the fruit.\\nGeneral use\\nBromelain is most notable for its effectiveness in the\\nreduction of inflammation and decreasing swelling, but\\nthe scope of its benefits continues to increase. As a nat-\\nural anti-inflammatory enzyme, bromelain has many\\nuses. Arthritis patients may reduce the swelling that\\ncauses joint pain by taking bromelain. Bromelain may\\nalso be helpful for the pain, numbness, tingling, aching,\\nand loss of motor and sensory function in the fingers re-\\nsulting from carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).\\nThe protease enzyme is beneficial in reducing the\\nclumping of platelets (small platelike bodies in the\\nblood), the formation of plaques in the arteries, and the\\nformation of blood clots . All these effects help to pre-\\nvent and treat cardiovascular disease. Bromelain has also\\nbeen discovered to have anti-tumor action, as well as\\nhelping the body absorb medications.\\nAlthough bromelain is often labeled an alternative\\ntreatment, mainstream medical research continues to\\nstudy its effectiveness in the prevention and treatment of\\nhematomas, or localized blood clots. Bromelain has been\\nfound useful in the reduction of swelling and congestion\\nin the affected tissue after an athletic injury or surgery. It\\nis commonly used in Germany for this purpose.\\nBromelain’s anti-clotting activity may be useful in\\npreventing strokes, one of the most feared results of ob-\\nstructions in the circulatory system. Due to the lack of oxy-\\ngenated blood flowing to the brain, a stroke can cause per-\\nmanent damage to the affected area of the central nervous\\nsystem. Bromelain is thought to help maintain healthy car-\\ndiac tissue and reduce the risk of stroke by its anti-inflam-\\nmatory activity. By preventing mild infection or inflamma-\\ntion caused by the fatty substances inside the blood vessels\\nwhere plaque may form, bromelain helps to reduce inflam-\\nmation by digesting the byproducts of tissue repair.\\nBromelain is helpful to people with colds due to its\\nability to reduce mucus and keep it moving out of the\\nbody. Bromelain has also been shown to reduce the\\npainful inflammation associated with costochondritis, an\\ninflammation of the cartilage that attaches the ribs to the\\nbreastbone. In addition, bromelain appears to be benefi-\\ncial to asthma patients. Asthma is caused by spasms of\\nthe bronchial passages that restrict the flow of air in and\\nout of the lungs. Taking bromelain may reduce the ex-\\ncess mucus that tends to collect in the respiratory sys-\\ntems of asthma patients. In addition, people who suffer\\nfrom hay fever and similar seasonal allergies may also\\nbe helped by bromelain’s antiinflammatory activity.\\nAdditional benefits of bromelain include reducing\\nthe painful symptoms of varicose veins , including dull\\naches, tired legs and feet, and itchy skin.\\nResearch has also shown that bromelain benefits\\ncows as well as humans. Bromelain has been shown to\\nreduce the white blood cell count in cows with mastitis.\\nThis reduction increases the quality of their milk. Re-\\nsearchers have found that bromelain works to reduce in-\\nflammation by interfering with the synthesis of\\nprostaglandins and other inflammatory substances.\\nPreparations\\nBromelain is available as a dietary supplement that\\nis offered in several different tablet strengths. For\\nrheumatoid arthritis, the recommended dosage of\\nbromelain is 250–750 mg, taken two or three times a day\\nbetween or before meals. In Germany, the standard\\ndosage to reduce swelling after surgery is 80–320 mg\\ndaily. The supplement has found to offer the most benefit\\nwhen taken on an empty stomach, and its therapeutic ef-\\nfects are also enhanced when taken in higher doses.\\nIncreasing the dosage of bromelain to 400–1,000 mg per\\nday has shown to reduce the symptoms of angina pectoris\\n(the severe pain and feeling of constriction about the heart\\nthat often radiates to the left shoulder and down the left arm).\\nPrecautions\\nBromelain has shown to be generally safe when\\ntaken in moderate doses, although a preliminary report\\nlinks an increased heart rate with the use of the supple-\\nment. People with an inflammation of the stomach lining\\nshould not use digestive enzyme supplements such as\\nbromelain. In addition, the safe use of bromelain in preg-\\nnant or nursing women, small children, and people with\\nkidney or liver disease has not been established.\\nSide effects\\nWhile bromelain can be taken safely without side\\neffects in moderate doses, there are anecdotal reports of\\nallergic reactions to it.

Chronic\\nbronchitis is recurrent, has a prolonged course, and is\\noften a sign of a serious underlying lung disease.\\nDescription\\nAcute bronchitis\\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the breathing air-\\nways accompanied by coughing and spitting up of\\nphlegm. It can be caused by exposure to a cold or the flu,\\ninfection, or irritants. Although the symptoms of acute\\nand chronic bronchitis are similar, their causes and treat-\\nments are different. Acute bronchitis is most common in\\nwinter. It usually follows an upper respiratory infection,\\nand may be accompanied by a secondary bacterial infec-\\ntion. Acute bronchitis usually resolves within two weeks,\\nalthough the cough may persist longer. Like any upper\\nairway inflammatory process, acute bronchitis can in-\\ncrease a person’s likelihood of developing pneumonia.\\nAnyone can get acute bronchitis, but infants, young\\nchildren, and the elderly are more likely to come down with\\nthe disease. Smokers and people with heart or lung diseases\\nare at a higher risk of developing acute bronchitis. Individu-\\nals exposed to chemical fumes or high levels of air pollution\\nalso have a greater chance of developing acute bronchitis.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nChronic bronchitis is one of a group of diseases that\\nfall under the name chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\\n(COPD). Other diseases in this category include emphyse-\\nma and chronic asthmatic bronchitis. Chronic bronchitis is\\na major cause of disability and death in the United States.\\nThe American Lung Association estimates that about 14\\nmillion Americans suffer from the disease. Chronic bron-\\nchitis shows symptoms similar to acute bronchitis, but it re-\\ncurs and is present for at least three months a year. Until re-\\ncently, more men than women developed chronic bronchi-\\ntis, but as the number of women who smoke has increased,\\nso has their rate of chronic bronchitis. Because this disease\\nprogresses slowly, middle-aged and older people are more\\nlikely to be diagnosed with chronic bronchitis.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAcute bronchitis\\nAcute bronchitis usually begins with the symptoms of a\\ncold, such as a runny nose,sneezing, and dry cough. How-\\never, the cough soon becomes deep and painful. Coughing\\nbrings up a greenish yellow phlegm or sputum. These symp-\\ntoms may be accompanied by a fever of up to 102°F\\nobserved include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and men-\\norrhagia (excessively heavy menstrual flow).\\nInteractions\\nBecause of bromelain’s anti-clotting activity, it should\\nnot be combined with other blood-thinning medications,\\nsuch as warfarin (Coumadin), heparin, or aspirin. It is also\\npossible that bromelain could cause problems with bleed-\\ning if it is combined with other complementary therapies\\nthat thin the blood, such as garlic or gingko biloba.\\nResources\\nPERIODICALS\\nKelly, G.S. “Bromelain: A Literature Review and Discussion of\\nIts Therapeutic Applications.” Alternative Medicine Re-\\nview (November 1, 1996).\\nPetry, Judy J. “Nutritional supplements and surgical patients.”\\nAORN Journal (June 1997).\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nAmerican Botanical Council.

A mix-\\nture of the essential oils of clove,Eugenia aromaticum;cin-\\nnamon,Cinnamomum zeylanicum;lemon balm, Melissa of-\\nficianalis;and lavender,Lavandula officinalis,is reported to\\nbe particularly effective when taken as a steam inhalation.\\nHerbalists recommend taking a tea, syrup or tincture\\nof any of the following: mullein , Verbascum thapsus;\\ncoltsfoot , Tussilago farfara; aniseed, Pimpinella\\nanisum; hyssop, Hyssopus officinalis; elecampane, Inula\\nhelenium; and garlic, Allium sativum. The Chinese herb\\nephedra, also called ma huang or Ephedra sinica, may\\nbe recommended as long as heart disease or high blood\\npressure is not a problem. Ephedra is only used in herbal\\ncombinations and when coughing and wheezing are pre-\\nsent. There are many remedies in traditional Chinese\\nmedicine for coughing and phlegm.\\n(38.8°C). Wheezingafter coughing is common. About 90%\\nof acute bronchitis is caused by a bacterial infection.\\nIn uncomplicated acute bronchitis, the fever and\\nmost other symptoms, except the cough, disappear after\\nthree to five days. Coughing may continue for several\\nweeks. Acute bronchitis is often complicated by a bacte-\\nrial infection, in which case the fever and a general feel-\\ning of illness persist.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nChronic bronchitis is caused by inhaling respiratory\\ntract irritants; it may also be due to recurrent bouts of\\nacute bronchitis. The most common cause, however, is\\nthe irritation of cigarette smoke. The cells that line the\\nrespiratory system contain fine, hair-like outgrowths\\ncalled cilia. Normally, the cilia of many cells beat rhyth-\\nmically to move mucus along the airways. When smoke\\nor other irritants are inhaled or when there is irritation\\nfrom repeated dry coughing, the cilia become paralyzed\\nor snap off and the airways become inflamed, narrowed,\\nand clogged. This leads to difficulty breathing and can\\nprogress to the life-threatening disease emphysema. A\\nmild cough is usually the first visible sign of chronic\\nbronchitis.

Aspirin should not\\nbe given to children because of its association with\\nseizures in children. Cough syrups are recommended to\\nreduce coughing, soothe irritation, and increase expecto-\\nration of mucus.\\nIt is important for mucus to be cleared from the\\nlungs. The use of cough suppressants should be limited\\nbecause when coughing is suppressed, the mucus accu-\\nmulates in the plugged airways and may become a\\nbreeding ground for pneumonia bacteria. If the patient is\\ncoughing up phlegm, the cough should be allowed to\\ncontinue to bring up mucus and irritants from the lungs.\\nCough medicines with expectorants may, therefore, be\\nhelpful. Expectorant cough medicines are used to thin\\nthe mucus in the lungs, making it easier to cough up and\\nexpel. People who are unsure about what type of med-\\nications are in over-the-counter cough syrups should ask\\ntheir pharmacist for an explanation.\\nIf a secondary bacterial infection is present, the\\ninfection may be treated with an antibiotic. Patients\\nneed to take the entire amount of antibiotic pre-\\nscribed. However, in 2002, a new study showed that\\nantibiotics really don’t do anything to help acute bron-\\nchitis. The drug is mostly prescribed to make the\\nphysician and the patient feel like they are “doing\\nsomething.” Inn a double blind study, treatment with\\ncough suppressant medication and inhaled albuterol\\nreported the same improvement as those patients who\\ntook antibiotics.\\nChronic bronchitis\\nDrug therapy uses bronchodilators to relax the mus-\\ncles of the bronchial tubes and allow increased airflow.\\nThey can be taken by mouth or inhaled using a nebulizer.\\nCommon bronchodilators include albuterol (Ventolin,\\nProventil, Apo-Salvent) and metaproterenol (Alupent,\\nOrciprenaline, Metaprel, Dey-Dose). Anti-inflammatory\\nmedications are added to reduce swelling of the airway\\ntissue. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be taken\\norally or intravenously. Other steroids are inhaled. Med-\\nications are also given to reduce the quantity of mucus.\\nAs the disease progresses, the patient may need supple-\\nmental oxygen. A one-time pneumonia vaccination may\\nalso be recommended.\\nIn 2002, a new drug therapy was approved to treat\\nchronic bronchitis, as well as other pulmonary diseases.\\nCalled Severent Diskus, or salmeterol, it is a long-acting\\nbronchodilator that can be inhaled twice a day and will\\nlast for 12 hours. It works well for patients with the\\nchronic form of bronchitis, but is not intended for use in\\nacute episodes.\\nExpected results\\nWhen treated, acute bronchitis normally resolves\\nin one to two weeks without complications, although a\\ncough may continue for several more weeks. Unfortu-\\nnately, there is no cure for chronic bronchitis, and the\\ndisease can often lead to or coexist with emphysema.\\nOn the whole, all forms of COPD are a leading cause\\nof death.\\nPrevention\\nThe best way to prevent bronchitis is not to begin\\nsmoking or to stop smoking. Smokers are 10 times more\\nlikely to die of COPD than non-smokers. Smokers who\\nstop show improvement in lung function. Other preven-\\ntative steps include avoiding chemical and environmental\\nirritants, such as air pollution, and maintaining good\\noverall health.\\nSupplementation with vitamins A, C, and E, zinc\\nand bioflavonoids may also be helpful in preventing re-\\ncurrence and secondary infections .

Odle\\nBruises\\nDefinition\\nBruises, or ecchymoses, are a discoloration and ten-\\nderness of the skin or mucous membranes due to the\\nleakage of blood from an injured blood vessel into the\\ntissues. Pupura refers to bruising as the result of a dis-\\nease condition. A very small bruise is called a petechia.\\nThese often appear as many tiny red dots clustered to-\\ngether, and could indicate a serious problem.\\nDescription\\nBruises change colors over time in a predictable pat-\\ntern, so that it is possible to estimate when an injury oc-\\ncurred by the color of the bruise. Initially, a bruise will\\nbe reddish, the color of the blood under the skin. After\\none to two days, the red blood cells begin to break down,\\nand the bruise will darken to a blue or purplish color.\\nThis fades to green at about day six. Around the eighth\\nor ninth day, the skin over the bruised area will have a\\nbrown or yellowish appearance, and it will gradually di-\\nminish back to its normal color.\\nLong periods of standing will cause the blood that\\ncollects in a bruise to seep through the tissues. Bruises\\nare actually made of little pools of blood, so the blood in\\none place may flow downhill after awhile and appear in\\nanother. For instance, bruising in the back of the ab-\\ndomen may eventually appear in the groin; bruising in the\\nthigh or the knee will work its way down to the ankle.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nHealthy people may develop bruises from any injury\\nthat doesn’t break through the skin. Vigorous exercisemay\\nalso cause bruises due to bringing about small tears in blood\\nvessels walls. In a condition known as purpura simplex,\\nthere is a tendency to bruise easily due to an increased\\nfragility of the blood vessels. Bruises also develop easily in\\nthe elderly, because the skin and blood vessels have a ten-\\ndency to become thinner and more fragile with aging, and\\nthere is an increased use of medications that interfere with\\nthe blood clotting system. In the condition known as purpu-\\nra senilis, the elderly develop bruises from minimal contact\\nthat may take up to several months to completely heal.\\nThe use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories such as\\nibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve) may lead to in-\\ncreased bruising. Aspirin, antidepressants,asthma med-\\nications, and cortisone medications also have this effect.\\nThe anti-clotting medications also known as blood thin-\\nners, especially the drug warfarin (Coumadin), may be\\nthe cause of particularly severe bruising.\\nSometimes bruises are connected with more serious\\nillnesses. There are a number of diseases that cause exces-\\nsive bleeding or bleeding from injuries too slight to have\\nconsequences in healthy people. An abnormal tendency to\\nbleed may be due to hereditary bleeding disorders, certain\\nprescription medications, diseases of the blood such as\\nleukemia, and diseases that increase the fragility of blood\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2306\\nBruises\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBronchoscopy—An examination of the lungs and air-\\nway passages using a flexible fiberoptic instrument.\\nEmphysema —A disease involving destruction of\\nair sacs in the lungs, so that they do not take in\\noxygen easily and have the tendency to retain air\\nwithin the lungs.\\nMucus—The slippery secretion of the mucous\\nmembranes of the respiratory tract.\\nPhlegm—A thick secretion of mucus produced in re-\\nsponse to irritation that may clog the airway passages.\\nSputum—Mucus and other substances coughed\\nup from the lungs.\\nTrachea—A cartilage tube in the area of the throat\\nthat carries air to the lungs.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 306'),\n",

Other causes\\nthat should be ruled out include liver disease,alcoholism,\\ndrug addiction, and acquired immune deficiency syn-\\ndrome (AIDS). Bruising that occurs around the navel may\\nindicate dangerous internal bleeding; bruising behind the\\near, called Battle’s sign, may be due to a skull fracture;\\nand raised bruises may point to autoimmune disease.\\nDiagnosis\\nBruising is usually a minor problem, which does not\\nrequire a medical diagnosis. However, faced with exten-\\nsive bruising, bruising with no apparent cause, or bruis-\\ning in certain locations, a physician will pursue an evalu-\\nation that will include a number of blood tests. If the area\\nof the bruise becomes hard, an x ray may be required.\\nTreatment\\nSeveral types of topical applications are usually rec-\\nommend to speed healing and to reduce the pain associ-\\nated with bruises. Vitamin K cream can be applied di-\\nrectly to the site of injury. Astringent herbs such as witch\\nhazel, Hamamelis virginiana , can be used. This will\\ntighten the tissues and therefore diminish the bruising.\\nThe homeopathic remedy,Arnica montana , can be ap-\\nplied as a cream or gel to unbroken skin.\\nOral homeopathic remedies may reduce bruising,\\npain, and swelling as well. Arnica montana , at 30 ml (1\\noz), taken one to two times per day is highly recom-\\nmended. For ledum, 30 ml (1 oz) one to two times per\\nday is also useful.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA bruise by itself needs no medical treatment. It is\\noften recommended that ice packs be applied on and off\\nduring the first 24 hours of injury to reduce the bruising.\\nAfter that, heat, especially moist heat, is recommended\\nto increase the circulation and the healing of the injured\\ntissues. Rest, elevation of the effected part, and compres-\\nsion with a bandage will also retard the accumulation of\\nblood. Rarely, if a bruise is so large that the body cannot\\ncompletely absorb it or if the site becomes infected, it\\nmay have to be surgically removed.\\nExpected results\\nThe blood under the skin which causes the discol-\\noration of bruising should be totally reabsorbed by the\\nbody in three weeks or less. At that time, the skin color\\nshould completely return to normal.\\nSometimes, a bruise may become solid and increase\\nin size instead of dissolving. This may indicate blood\\ntrapped in the tissues, which may be need to be drained.\\nThis is referred to as a hematoma. Less commonly, the\\nbody may develop calcium deposits at the injury site in a\\nprocess called heterotopic ossification.\\nPrevention\\nVitamin K promotes normal clotting in the blood,\\nand therefore may help reduce the tendency to bruise\\neasily. Green leafy vegetables,alfalfa , broccoli, sea-\\nweed, and fish liver oils are dietary sources of vitamin K.\\nOther good foods to eat would be those containing\\nbioflavonoids, such as reddish-blue berries. These can\\nassist in strengthening the connective tissue, which will\\ndecrease the spread of blood and bruising.

It most often occurs at night during sleep, but may\\nalso occur during the day. It is an unconscious behavior\\nor habit perhaps performed to release anxiety , aggres-\\nsion, or anger.\\nDescription\\nBruxism is one of the oldest disorders known, and\\napproximately one in four adults experience it. It can\\noccur in children and adolescents as well; cases of brux-\\nism in children as young as 24 months have been report-\\ned. Most people are not aware of the disorder until their\\nteeth have been damaged.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nWhile bruxism is typically associated with stress,i t\\nmay also be triggered by abnormal occlusion (the way the\\nupper and lower teeth fit together) or crooked or missing\\nteeth. Symptoms of bruxism include: dull headaches; sore\\nand tired facial muscles; earaches; sensitive teeth; and\\nlocking, popping, and clicking of the jaw. During a dental\\nexamination, a dentist may recognize damage resulting\\nfrom bruxism, including: enamel loss from the chewing\\nsurfaces of teeth; flattened tooth surfaces; loosened teeth;\\nand fractured teeth and fillings. Left untreated, bruxism\\nmay lead to tooth loss and jaw dysfunction.\\nBruxism also appears to be associated with Rett\\nsyndrome, an X-linked neurodegenerative disorder that\\noccurs almost exclusively in girls. It is not known as of\\n2003 why children with this disorder frequently devel-\\nop bruxism.\\nDiagnosis\\nMedical and dental histories, examinations, and x\\nrays are usually necessary to differentiate bruxism from\\nother conditions that may cause similar pain, such as ear\\ninfections , dental infections, and temporomandibular\\njoint syndrome (TMJ). In many cases, untreated brux-\\nism can lead to chronic TMJ due to the stress that pro-\\nlonged grinding places on the jaw and the temporo-\\nmandibular joint.\\nWearing away of the tooth surface is generally regard-\\ned as the most important clinical sign of bruxism. Although\\nthere is no universally accepted scale for measuring the de-\\ngree of tooth wear, a 2002 Dutch study reported on a five-\\npoint scale that appears to be a reliable instrument for diag-\\nnosing bruxism. The five points are as follows:\\n• 0 = no wear.\\n• 1 = visible wear within the tooth enamel.\\n• 2 = visible wear with dentine exposure and loss of\\ncrown height.\\n• 3 = loss of crown height between 1/3 and 2/3.\\n• 4 = loss of crown height greater than 2/3.\\nTreatment\\nStress management and relaxation techniques, such\\nas hypnosis and guided imagery, may be useful in break-\\ning the habit of jaw clenching and teeth grinding. Tight\\njaw muscles are often relaxed by applying warm com-\\npresses to the sides of the face. Acupuncture may relieve\\nthe jaw tension associated with both bruxism and TMJ.\\nMassage therapyand deep tissue realignment, including\\nrolfing, can also assist in releasing the clenching pattern.\\nAnti-spasmodic herbal preparations which also con-\\ntain central nervous system relaxant properties, such as\\nchamomile(Matricaria chamomilla), may be prescribed\\nbefore bed to prevent grinding while asleep.\\nBiofeedback, which teaches an individual to control\\nmuscle tension and any associated pain through thought\\nand visualization techniques, is also a treatment option\\nfor bruxism. In biofeedback treatments, sensors placed\\non the surface of the jaw are connected to a special ma-\\nchine that allows the patient and healthcare professional\\nto monitor a visual and/or audible readout of the level of\\ntension in the jaw muscles. Through relaxation and visu-\\nalization exercises, the patient learns to relieve the ten-\\nsion and can actually see or hear the results of their ef-\\nforts instantly through the sensor readout on the biofeed-\\nback equipment. Once the technique is learned and the\\npatient is able to recognize and differentiate between the\\nfeelings of muscle tension and muscle relaxation, the\\nbiofeedback equipment itself is no longer needed and the\\npatient has a powerful, portable, and self-administered\\ntreatment tool to deal with pain and tension.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTo prevent further damage to the teeth and jaw,\\nbruxism is treated by placing a removable custom-fitted\\nplastic appliance called a night guard between the upper\\nand lower teeth. Although the clenching and grinding be-\\nhavior may continue, the teeth wear away the plastic in-\\nstead of each other.\\nIn some cases, abnormal occlusion may be adjusted\\nand high spots removed so that the teeth fit together in a\\nmore comfortable position. Missing teeth may be re-\\nplaced and crooked teeth may be straightened with or-\\nthodontic treatment to eliminate possible underlying\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2308\\nBruxism\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 308'),\n",

In opposition\\nto traditional medicine, the Law of Infinitesimal states\\nthat the lower a dose of curative, the more effective it is.\\nTo achieve a low dose, the curative is diluted many,\\nmany times until only a tiny amount, if any, remains in a\\nlarge amount of the diluting liquid.\\nIn homeopathic terminology, the effectiveness of\\nremedies is proved by experimentation and reporting\\ndone by famous homeopathic practitioners. Bryonia was\\nproved as a remedy by the German founder of homeopa-\\nthy, Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1775–1843) in 1834.\\nIn homeopathic medicine, bryonia is used to treat\\nsymptoms that develop slowly. These symptoms include\\nfeeling lethargic, tired, irritable, extremely thirsty, and\\nfeeling excruciating pain upon the slightest movement.\\nPsychological symptoms include feeling mentally slug-\\ngish. People who need bryonia may fall into a stupor and\\nbe confused when called back to reality, especially at\\nnight. Some people feel indecisive and restless despite\\nthe fact that any movement makes their symptoms worse.\\nBryonia is used to treat dry, spasmodic cough that\\ncauses pain, influenza symptoms, and severe headaches\\nthat develop slowly. It is also used to treat chronic dis-\\neases such as arthritis, painful or swollen joints, and\\nrheumatism.\\nOther conditions for which homeopathic healers\\nrecommend bryonia include inflammation of the chest,\\npleurisy, pneumonia, and other lung conditions. Byro-\\nnia is also said to have an effect on the digestive system.\\nIt is used to treat abdominal pain, acute gastroenteritis,\\ndiarrhea (especially diarrhea that is worse in the morn-\\ning), nausea, and vomiting.\\nIn homeopathic medicine the fact that certain symp-\\ntoms get better or worse under different conditions is\\nused as a diagnostic tool to indicate what remedy will be\\nmost effective. Symptoms that benefit from treatment\\nwith bryonia get much worse with movement. The\\nsmallest movement aggravates the person needing bry-\\nonia. Symptoms may get worse after eating and drink-\\ning, despite the fact that people needing bryonia crave\\ncool drinks and food. Symptoms also get worse in heat\\nand in the summer. People may feel dizzy in the heat and\\nhave trouble sleeping. Pain is worse at night and on the\\nright side of the body. Symptoms improve with rest, ap-\\nplication of pressure to the painful part of the body, re-\\nmaining still, and a cool environment.\\nHomeopathy also ascribes certain personality types\\nto certain remedies. The bryonia personality is said to be\\ninsecure about their financial situation, even when they\\nare wealthy, and thus become materialistic. People with\\nthe bryonia personality tend to be calculating, clean-liv-\\ning, prudent, and meticulous about details, fitting the\\nstereotype of an accountant or banker.\\nOutside of homeopathy, bryonia has a long history\\nof folk use. The Greeks used bryony to treat gangrene,\\nand in the Middle Ages it was used to treat leprosy. Mod-\\nern herbalists use bryony to treat painful joints. It may be\\ntaken internally, or the leaves may be applied externally\\nto increase blood flow to the painful area. It is also used\\nto treat asthma, bronchitis , pleurisy, and intestinal ul-\\ncers. Some herbalists use it to reduce blood pressure.\\nPreparations\\nThe root is dug in the autumn, chopped, then pound-\\ned into a pulp. For homeopathic remedies, the dried plant\\nmaterial is ground finely then prepared by extensive di-\\nlutions. There are two homeopathic dilution scales of di-\\nlution, the decimal (x) scale with a dilution of 1:10 and\\nthe centesimal (c) scale where the dilution factor is\\n1:100. Once the mixture is diluted, shaken, strained, then\\nre-diluted many times to reach the desired degree of po-\\ntency, the final mixture is added to lactose (a type of\\nsugar) tablets or pellets. These are then stored away from\\nlight. Bryonia is available commercially in tablets in\\nmany different strengths. Dosage depends on the symp-\\ntoms being treated.\\nHomeopathic and orthodox medical practitioners\\nagree that by the time the initial remedy solution is dilut-\\ned to strengths used in homeopathic healing, it is likely\\nthat very few, if any, molecules of the original remedy re-\\nmain. Homeopaths, however, believe that these remedies\\ncontinue to work through an effect called potentization\\nthat has not yet been explained by mainstream scientists.\\nPrecautions\\nBryonia is a poisonous plant and should be used as a\\nfolk remedy very, very cautiously. It can cause death.\\nWhen taken in the extremely dilute doses recommended\\nby homeopaths, it has no toxicity, although some individ-\\nuals may have a personal adverse reaction to the remedy.\\nSide effects\\nWhen taken in the recommended homeopathic di-\\nlute form, no side effects have been reported. When\\ntaken in larger doses, bryonia irritates and inflames the\\ndigestive system, which may result in death.\\nInteractions\\nStudies on interactions between bryonia and con-\\nventional pharmaceuticals or other herbs have not been\\nfound.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2310\\nBryonia\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 310'),\n",

Ajugas are part of the Lamiaceae, the\\nsame grouping to which plants of the mint family belong.\\nOther names by which bugle weed is known include water\\nbugle, sweet bugle, Virginian water horehound, and\\ngypsy weed. Bugle weeds usually have shining, oval-\\nshaped leaves that are reminiscent of spinach leaves in ap-\\npearance and have glandular dots on their underside. This\\nfoliage grows thickly along the surface of a spreading\\ntransverse root. Bugle weed blooms in spring, typically\\nproducing flowers of a startling cobalt blue. Some species,\\nhowever, have pink or white flowers. Bugle weed flowers\\nare tubular and lipped in appearance, growing in whorls\\nalong the erect spikes that rise from the dense foliage.\\nThere are different varieties of bugle weed with\\nvarying characteristics:\\n• Ajuga genevensis, or Geneva bugle weed, is one of the\\ntaller varieties. It has very dense, dark green leaves,\\nwhich can grow to 4–5 in (10–12 cm) in length, and\\nproduce spikes 6–12 in (15–30 cm) high with either\\npink or blue flowers in clusters along the spike.\\n• Ajuga pyramidalis, or upright bugle weed, is a bushy, slow-\\ner-growing plant with very shiny leaves that are slightly\\npuckered. This variety also has bright blue flowers.\\n• Ajuga Reptans is the most common type of bugle weed.\\nIt is smaller, with 4–10 in (10–20 cm) spikes, and\\nleaves 2–3 in (5–7.5 cm) in length. Its flowers are the\\nsame cobalt blue, and leaves may be either dark green\\nor bronze-colored. There are several highly attractive\\nsub-types in the A. reptans grouping. A. reptans alba\\nhas white flowers; Atropurpurea has bronze leaves;\\nburgundy glow bugle weed has three-toned white,\\ngreen and pink foliage; and several others are combina-\\ntions of these.\\nBugle weed grows in either sun or shade, in well-\\ndrained, fairly rich soil. It establishes itself rather quick-\\nly and spreads via underground roots. It can become very\\ninvasive, and generally provides a mat of dense ground\\ncover that does not permit the growth of weeds or other\\nplants. It can be propagated by dividing the plants.\\nIt is believed that bugle weed is native to the Northern\\nHemisphere, worldwide. Species of bugle weed are found\\nin Europe, Asia, and North America. Like other members\\nof the Laminaceae or mint family, bugle weed has a mild,\\npleasant, mint-like aroma when it is freshly picked. It con-\\ntains flavone glycosides, volatile oils, and tannins.\\nGeneral use\\nBeside its horticultural use as an attractive spreading\\nground cover in rock gardens and other types of gardens,\\nbugle weed is useful medicinally for several different pur-\\nposes. It is an astringent, and is considered to have seda-\\ntive qualities as well. It can calm anxiety symptoms, in-\\ncluding heart palpitations. It is a valued cough suppres-\\nsant. In old herbal remedy books such as Thayer’s Fluid\\nand Solid Extracts, and even in the more recent A Modern\\nHerbal, the authors state that in addition to cough sup-\\npression, bugle weed is also useful for healing tuberculo-\\nsis and stopping bleeding from the lungs. It has long been\\nrecognized in Western herbal medicine as a cardiac tonic\\nand can actually slow a rapid heart rate and improve the\\nfunctioning of a weak heart by increasing the strength of\\nthe heartbeat. Because of its diuretic properties, bugle\\nweed is useful in removing excess fluid from the body\\nand thus improving circulation. It has been shown to in-\\nhibit the body’s metabolism of iodine, and is helpful for\\nthis reason in treating hyperthyroidism. Poultices con-\\ntaining bugle weed leaves in combination with other\\nherbs have been found to speed the healing of bruised\\nareas. Lastly, bugle weed is useful in weaning babies as it\\nhelps to suppress the production of breast milk.\\nPreparations\\nAll parts of the bugle weed that grow above ground\\nare used in herbal medicine. It is collected in early spring\\nbefore the flower buds open. The entire plant is dried and\\npulverized, and used as a decoction or tea. The tea is\\nmade by pouring a cup of boiling water over one tea-\\nspoonful of dried bugle weed, and allowing this mixture\\nto steep for 10–15 minutes. This tea may be taken three\\ntimes a day.

People with bulimia, known as bulimics, con-\\nsume large amounts of food (binge) and then try to rid\\nthemselves of the food and calories (purge) through fast-\\ning, excessive exercise , vomiting , or use of laxatives.\\nBulimics often feel that the behavior serves to reduce\\nstressand relieve anxiety. Because bulimia results from\\nan excessive concern with weight control and self-image,\\nand is often accompanied by depression, it is also con-\\nsidered a psychiatric illness.\\nDescription\\nBulimia nervosa is a serious health problem for\\nmore than two million adolescent girls and young\\nwomen in the United States. The bingeing and purging\\nactivity associated with this disorder can cause severe\\ndamage, even death, although the risk of death is not as\\nhigh as for anorexia nervosa , an eating disorder that\\nleads to excessive weight loss.\\nBinge eating may in rare instances cause the stom-\\nach to rupture. In the case of purging, heart failure can\\nresult due to loss of vital minerals such as potassium .\\nV omiting causes other serious problems, including acid-\\nrelated scarring of the fingers (if used to induce vomit-\\ning) and damage to tooth enamel. In addition, the tube\\nthat brings food from the mouth to the stomach (the\\nesophagus) often becomes inflamed and salivary glands\\ncan become swollen. Irregular menstrual periods can\\nalso result, and interest in sex may diminish.\\nMost bulimics find it difficult to stop their behavior\\nwithout professional help. Many typically recognize that\\nthe behavior is not normal, but feel out of control. Some\\nbulimics struggle with other compulsive, risky behaviors\\nsuch as drug and alcohol abuse. Many also suffer from\\nother psychiatric illnesses, including clinical depression,\\nanxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).\\nin this mixture, cooled until warm but not hot enough to\\nburn the patient, and applied to the bruised area.\\nPrecautions\\nBugle weed should not be used internally if a person\\nhas a thyroid condition unless they have consulted a physi-\\ncian or health care practitioner. Because of bugle weed’s\\ninfluence on thyroid function and its ability to reduce se-\\ncretions (including breast milk), it should be used only for\\nshort periods and prescribed by a trained practitioner.\\nIn addition, plants in the mint family, which in-\\ncludes bugle weed, are high in methyl salicylate. This\\ncompound causes allergies in some people.\\nSide effects\\nThe Complete German Commission E Monographs\\nincludes reports of uncommon cases of long-term high-\\ndosage therapy with bugle weed preparations resulting in\\nenlargement of the thyroid gland. When this herb is used\\nin the treatment of hyperthyroidism, its sudden stoppage\\ncan result in an increase in the symptoms.\\nInteractions\\nBugle weed preparations may interfere with the use\\nof radioactive isotopes used in some diagnostic proce-\\ndures.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBlumenthal, Mark.

People\\nof all races develop the disorder, but most of those diag-\\nnosed are white.\\nBulimic behavior is often carried out in secrecy, accom-\\npanied by feelings of guilt or shame. Outwardly, many peo-\\nple with bulimia appear healthy and successful, while inside\\nthey have feelings of helplessness and low self-esteem.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses\\nThe cause of bulimia is unknown. Researchers be-\\nlieve that it may be caused by a combination of genetic\\nand environmental factors. Bulimia tends to run in fami-\\nlies. Research shows that certain brain chemicals, known\\nas neurotransmitters, may function abnormally in acutely\\nill bulimia patients. Scientists also believe there may be a\\nlink between bulimia and other psychiatric problems,\\nsuch as depression and OCD. Environmental influences\\ninclude participation in work or sports that emphasize\\nthinness, such as modeling, dancing, or gymnastics. Fam-\\nily pressures also may play a role. One study found that\\nmothers who are extremely concerned about their daugh-\\nters’ physical attractiveness and weight may help to cause\\nbulimia. In addition, girls with eating disorders tend to\\nhave fathers and brothers who criticize their weight.\\nSymptoms\\nAccording to the American Anorexia/Bulimia Asso-\\nciation, Inc., warning signs of bulimia include:\\n• eating large amounts of food uncontrollably (bingeing)\\n• vomiting, abusing laxatives or diuretics, or engaging in\\nfasting, dieting, or vigorous exercise (purging)\\n• preoccupation with body weight\\n• using the bathroom frequently after meals\\n• depression or mood swings\\n• irregular menstrual periods\\n• onset of dental problems, swollen cheeks or glands,\\nheartburn or bloating\\nDiagnosis\\nBulimia is treated most successfully when diag-\\nnosed early. But because the bulimic may deny there is a\\nproblem, getting medical help is often delayed. A com-\\nplete physical examination in order to rule out other ill-\\nnesses is the first step toward diagnosis.\\nAccording to the American Psychiatric Association,\\na diagnosis of bulimia requires that a person have all of\\nthe following symptoms: >\\n• recurrent episodes of binge eating (minimum average\\nof two binge-eating episodes a week for at least three\\nmonths)\\n• a feeling of lack of control over eating during the\\nbinges\\n• regular use of one or more of the following to prevent\\nweight gain: self-induced vomiting, use of laxatives or\\ndiuretics, strict dieting or fasting, or vigorous exercise\\n• persistent over-concern with body shape and weight\\nTreatment\\nAlternative therapies may be used as complemen-\\ntary to conventional treatment program for bulimic pa-\\ntients. They include diet, nutritional therapy, herbal ther-\\napy,homeopathy, hydrotherapy, biofeedback training,\\nhypnotherapy, massage therapy and light therapy.\\nDiet\\nThe following dietary changes may be helpful for\\nbulimic patients:\\n• Eat small but nutritious meals at regularly scheduled\\nhours.\\n• Avoid sweet, baked goods or any other foods that may\\ncause craving.\\n• Avoid allergenic foods.\\n• Limit intake of alcohol, caffeine , monosodium gluta-\\nmate (MSG), and salty foods.\\nNutritional therapy\\nThe following supplements may help improve bu-\\nlimic symptoms and prevent deficiency of essential vita-\\nmins and minerals:\\n• Multivitamin and mineral supplement to prevent defi-\\nciency of essential nutrients.\\n• Vitamin B complex with C.\\n• Zinc supplement.

It is caused by inflamma-\\ntion and usually results from chronic irritation and pres-\\nsure from poorly fitting footwear.\\nDescription\\nA displacement of two major bones of the foot (hal-\\nlux valgus) causes bunions, although not everyone with\\nthis displacement will develop the joint swelling and\\nbone overgrowth that characterize a bunion. One of the\\nbones involved is called the first metatarsal bone. This\\nbone is long and slender, with the big toe attached on\\none end and the other end connected to foot bones closer\\nto the ankle. This foot bone is displaced in the direction\\nof the four other metatarsals connected with the toes.\\nThe other bone involved is the big toe itself, which is\\ndisplaced toward the smaller toes. As the big toe contin-\\nues to move toward the smaller toes, it may become dis-\\nplaced under or over the second toe. The displacement of\\nthese two foot bones causes a projection of bone on the\\ninside portion of the forefoot. The skin over this projec-\\ntion often becomes inflamed from rubbing against the\\nshoe, and a callus may form.\\nThe joint contains a small sac (bursa) filled with\\nfluid that cushions the bones and helps the joint to move\\nsmoothly. When a bunion forms, this sac becomes in-\\nflamed and thickened. Inflammation of the bursa is\\ncalled bursitis. The swelling in the joint causes addition-\\nal pain and pressure in the toe.\\nBunions can also form on the bones that attach the\\nlittle toe to the foot (the fifth metatarsal bone). These\\nbunions are called tailor’s bunion or bunionette.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBunions may form as a result of abnormal motion of\\nthe foot during walking or running. One common exam-\\nple of an abnormal movement is an excessive amount of\\nstress placed upon the inside of the foot. This leads to\\nfriction and irritation of the involved structures. Age has\\nalso been noted as a factor in developing bunions, in part\\nbecause the underlying bone displacement worsens over\\ntime unless corrective measures are taken.\\nWearing improperly fitting shoes, especially those\\nwith a narrow toe box and excessive heel height, often\\ncauses the formation of a bunion. This forefoot deformity\\nis seen more often in women than men. The higher fre-\\nquency in females may be related to the strong link be-\\ntween footwear fashion and bunions. In fact, in a recent\\nsurvey of more than 350 women, nearly 90% wore shoes\\nthat were at least one size too small or too narrow. Shoes\\nwithout proper arch supports contribute to bunions, since\\nthey allow the foot to roll inward (pronate,) putting more\\npressure on the joint of the big toe.\\nBecause genetic factors can predispose people to\\nhallux valgus bone displacement, a strong family history\\nof bunions can increase the likelihood of developing this\\nfoot disorder. Various arthritic conditions and several ge-\\nnetic and neuromuscular diseases, such as Down syn-\\ndrome and Marfan syndrome, cause muscle imbalances\\nthat can create bunions from displacement of the first\\nmetatarsal and big toe. Other possible causes of bunions\\nare leg-length discrepancies (with the bunion present on\\nthe longer leg) and trauma occurring to the joint of the\\nbig toe. Persons with flat feet or gout are at increased\\nrisk for developing bunions.\\nSymptoms of bunions include the common signs of\\ninflammation such as redness, swelling, and pain. The\\ndiscomfort is primarily located along the inside of the\\nfoot just behind the big toe. Because of friction, a callus\\nmay develop over the bunion. If an overlapping of the\\ntoes is allowed, additional rubbing and pain occurs. In-\\nflammation of this area causes a decrease in motion with\\nassociated discomfort in the joint between the big toe\\nand the first metatarsal. If allowed to worsen, the skin\\nover the bunion may break down causing an ulcer, which\\nalso presents a problem of potential infection. (Foot ul-\\ncers can be particularly dangerous for people with dia-\\nbetes, who may have trouble feeling the ulcer forming\\nand healing if it becomes infected.)\\nDiagnosis\\nA thorough medical history and physical exam by a\\nphysician is always necessary for the proper diagnosis of\\nbunions and other foot conditions. X rays can help con-\\nfirm the diagnosis by showing the bone displacement,\\njoint swelling, and, in some cases, the overgrowth of\\nbone that characterizes bunions. Doctors will also con-\\nsider the possibility that the joint pain is caused by or\\ncomplicated by arthritis (which causes destruction of the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2318\\nBunion\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 318'),\n",

A foam-rubber\\npad may be worn at night while sleeping to separate the\\nbig toe from the other toes. Various taping techniques\\ncan be useful to realign the toe and decrease friction and\\nrubbing that may be present. Most patients are instructed\\nto rest or choose exercises that put less stress on their\\nfeet, at least until the misalignment is corrected.\\nPersons with bunions should wear shoes that have\\nenough room in the toe box to accommodate the bunion.\\nHigh-heeled shoes and tight-fitting socks or stockings\\nshould be avoided. Sandals are a good choice. Shoes\\nmay be stretched to provide more comfort or customized\\nto relieve pressure on the affected area. Shoes should be\\nremoved periodically during the day to give feet a break.\\nDressings and pads help protect the bunion from addi-\\ntional shoe pressure. Arch supports can reduce the pres-\\nsure on the bunion. The application of splints or cus-\\ntomized shoe inserts (orthotics) to correct the alignment\\nof the big toe joint is effective for many bunions. These\\ncan correct the excessive pronation (turning inward) so\\nthat the pressure is not continually on the big toe.\\nDeep friction massage techniques by a physical or\\nmassage therapist can be helpful to increase circulation,\\nreduce inflammation, and prevent soft tissue build-up.\\nPhysical therapy also provides useful approaches, such\\nas ultrasound, to help retard or reverse the formation of\\nthe bunion.\\nOne study found that using an extract from marigold\\n(Tagetes patula) with a protective pad led to a reduction\\nin the size and pain of bunions. A used chamomile tea\\nbag applied to a bunion may be helpful. Massaging with\\nessential oil of chamomile or with a cream containing\\nchamomile may provide relief.

This procedure is called a bunionectomy,\\nand there are many variations on the operation, which is\\nusually performed by a surgeon who specializes in treat-\\ning bone conditions (orthopedics) or by one who special-\\nizes in treating the foot (podiatry). The procedure chosen\\ndepends upon the angle of the bone misalignment, con-\\ndition of the bursa, and strength of the bones. Most\\nbunionectomies involve the removal of a section of bone\\nand the insertion of pins to rejoin the bone.

This massive herb is thought of as a tenacious\\nweed by many gardeners but it is valued by herbalists\\nworldwide as a medicinal and culinary storehouse. Great\\nburdock may grow as tall as 9 ft (3 m) in its second year.\\nCommon burdock (Articum minus ) a smaller species, is\\nabundant in North America, growing to 5 ft (1.5 m) tall.\\nThere are about 10 species of burdock.\\nOver the centuries, the hardy burdock has acquired\\nmany names, including beggar’s buttons, bardana, burr\\nseed, clot-bur, clothburr, cocklebur, cockle buttons, fox’s\\nclote, great burr, Gypsy rhubarb, happy major, hardock,\\nhareburr, love leaves, personata, philanthropium, thorny\\nburr, and turkey burrseed. In Japan the herb is known as\\ngobo and is cultivated for its somewhat sweet-tasting\\nroot, an ingredient in numerous culinary dishes. Gobo has\\nbeen grown in the United States as a vegetable for soups\\nand salds since the 1980s. In Russia, a common name for\\nthe herb is lapuh. Most common folk names for this\\nmember of the Compositae family refer to the large and\\nprickly seed covers that adhere securely to passersby.\\nBurdock has a deep primary root producing a large\\nrosette of basal leaves in the first year that may grow as\\nlarge as 1.5 ft (0.45 m) long and nearly as wide. In the\\nsecond year of growth, burdock shoots upward with a\\nstout, grooved, branching stem. Leaf stalks are longer\\nthan the leaves, and each has a purple hue at the base that\\nextends up the stalk along the inner groove and into the\\nleaf veins. Stalks are hollow in common burdock. Leaves\\nresemble those of rhubarb in size and shape. They are\\ndark green on top and a downy, pale green on the under-\\nside. Flower heads are round and thistle-like, with nu-\\nmerous, small purple-hued, funnel-shaped blooms in\\nmid-summer to early fall. Blossoms are surrounded by\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2320\\nBurdock root\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBursitis—Inflammation of the bursa.\\nOrthopedics —A medical specialty concerned\\nwith treating diseases, injuries, and malformations\\nof the bones and supporting structures, such as\\ntendons, ligaments, and muscles.\\nOrthotic—A device or brace used to control, cor-\\nrect, or compensate for a bone deformity.\\nPodiatry—A medical specialty concerned with\\ntreating diseases, injuries, and malformations of\\nthe feet.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 320'),\n",

Most of the herb’s\\nmedicinal constituents are stored in these underground\\nparts. The entire plant has both nutritive and medicinal\\nuses. The roots contain as much as 45% inulin, as well as\\nalkaloids, essential oil, flavonoids, glycosides, mucilage,\\npolyacetylenes, resin, tannins, and volatile oil. The seeds\\nare rich in vitamins A and B and essential fatty acids .\\nBoth the seeds and the root have a demulcent quality that\\nis soothing to the mucous membranes of the body. The\\nleaves are generally less potent than the root and seed\\nwhen used in medicinal preparations.\\nBurdock is primarily a tonic and alterative herb. The\\ncumulative effect of its use is said to bring a subtle\\nstrengthening and cleansing to the entire system. Though\\nmost of the therapeutic benefits attributed to this stately\\nherb have not been clinically proven, burdock has been\\nlong tested in folk use, and is a safe, if mild, herbal remedy.\\nBurdock has been traditionally used as a blood purifier. It\\npromotes perspiration and the release of toxins from the\\nbody. It is helpful in clearing up such skin conditions as\\npsoriasisand dry, scaly eczema. It works best when used\\nover a period of time. The bitter properties of burdock, par-\\nticularly noticeable in the dried leaf and seed, stimulate\\nbile secretions. It is a good digestive herb and liver remedy.\\nBurdock’s anti-microbial and fungistatic properties have\\nbeen traced to as many as 14 different polyacetylene com-\\npounds in the root. Burdock has been used to treat boils,\\ncanker sores, carbuncles, measles, and sties. It will help\\nrestore friendly bacteria in the system after antibiotic use,\\nand may bring relief in cases of chronic arthritis and gout.\\nBurdock may also help reduce blood sugar levels.\\nIn medieval times burdock was used for more seri-\\nous problems, such as the treatment of syphilis and lep-\\nrosy. Hildegard of Bingen, a twelfth-century German\\nabbess, considered burdock a valuable remedy for can-\\ncerous tumors. Herbalists in other cultures and times, in-\\ncluding the Americas, China, India, and Russia have\\nturned to the root of this familiar herb for a folk treat-\\nment of cancer. The oil of burdock, known as repeinoe\\nmaslo, used over a period of six to eight months, was\\nsaid to help stimulate the growth of new hair. A drink\\nprepared with aged wine and fine-shredded, fresh bur-\\ndock leaves was taken after the bite of a mad dog. A\\npoultice of the fresh leaf, applied to the forehead was\\nused to relieve headache . Shredded leaves were also\\ncombined with an egg white, beaten until stiff, and the\\nmixture was applied to burns to speed healing.\\nBurdock seeds have also been used in medicinal\\npreparations, particularly to treat psoriasis and to stimulate\\nthe digestive process. In Chinese medicine seeds were\\nused as a treatment for feverish colds and sore throat.\\nBurdock has been recently shown to have significant\\nantibacterial and anticandidal activity, which helps to ex-\\nplain its place in folk medicine as a treatment for various\\ninfectious diseases. In addition, a team of Asian re-\\nsearchers reported in 2002 that burdock appears to coun-\\nteract the damaging effects of alcohol on the liver.\\nPreparations\\nBurdock root is harvested from the first-year plant\\nin the early fall. Roots are deep and may be difficult to\\nextract. The leaves are best used when fresh, as the dried\\nleaf is bitter. Harvesting is done before the plant flowers.\\nDecoction: Burdock’s medicinal properties, concen-\\ntrated in the root, are best extracted by decoction. Add\\nabout 1 tsp of thinly-sliced, fresh or dried burdock root\\nper 8 oz of cold water in a glass or ceramic pot. Bring to\\na boil. Reduce heat and simmer for about 20 minutes.\\nDrink up to three cups daily.\\nPoultice: Simmer fresh, chopped burdock leaves for\\nup to five minutes. Drain, squeezing out the liquid. Cool\\nuntil warm. Apply to the affected area and secure with a\\nclean strip of cotton gauze. A little oil applied to the skin\\nfirst may keep the poultice from sticking when dry. Pre-\\npare a fresh poultice every few hours until the desired re-\\nlief is obtained.\\nTincture: Combine one part fresh herb to three parts\\nalcohol (50% alcohol/water solution) in glass container.\\nSet aside in dark place. Shake daily for two weeks.\\nStrain through muslin or cheesecloth, and store in dark\\nbottle. The tincture should maintain potency for two\\nyears. Standard dosage, unless otherwise prescribed, is\\n1/2 tsp, three times daily.\\nCulinary: Fresh burdock roots are mild tasting and\\nsomewhat sweet. They may be peeled and thinly sliced\\nto add to soups, salads, and in a mixture of stir-fried veg-\\netables. The young leaves of the first year plant may be\\neaten fresh or steamed as a nutritious potherb, and the\\nfresh stalks, peeled and steamed until tender, are also a\\nculinary treat. Burdock root, roasted and ground to a\\npowder, has been used as coffee additive or substitute.\\nPrecautions\\nSome commercially available burdock leaves and\\nroots have been suspected of being adulterated, on occa-\\nsion, with the root of the deadly belladonna (Atropa bel-\\nladonna) with toxic consequences to unwary users.

A second-de-\\ngree burn involves redness, swelling, and blistering. The\\ndamage extends beneath the epidermis to the deeper lay-\\ners of skin, the dermis. A third-degree burn, also called a\\nfull-thickness burn, destroys the entire depth of skin,\\ncausing significant scarring. Damage also may extend to\\nthe underlying fat, muscle, or bone. Third-degree burns\\nrequire immediate medical attention. Burns are the third\\nleading cause of accidental death in North America.\\nThe severity of a burn is judged by the amount of\\nbody surface area (BSA) involved as well as the depth of\\nthe burn. A burn is considered to be critical, or major, if a\\nperson has third-degree burns on more than 10% of the\\nBSA or second-degree burns covering more than 25% of\\nan adult’s BSA, and more than 20% of a child’s BSA.\\nSuch burns are serious and should be treated in a special-\\nized hospital burn unit. Burns involving the hands, feet,\\nface, eyes, ears, or genitals are considered critical, as\\nwell. Moderate burns are defined as first- or second-de-\\ngree burns covering 15%-25% of an adult’s body or 10%-\\n20% of a child’s body, or a third-degree burn on 2%-10%\\nBSA. These burns also require medical attention.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nBurns may be caused by any encounter, however\\nbrief, with heat greater than 120°F (49°C). The source of\\nthis heat may be the sun, hot liquids, steam, fire, electric-\\nity, friction (rug burns and rope burns,) and chemicals.\\nSigns that the skin has been burned are localized red-\\nness, swelling, and pain. A blister may develop. The skin\\nmay peel, appear white or charred, and feel numb. A\\nburn may trigger a headache or fever, and extensive\\nburns may induce shock.\\nThermal burns are caused by heat sources such as\\nfire, hot liquids, gases or other objects. Radiation burns\\nare usually due to excess exposure to the sun’s rays, tan-\\nning beds, or x rays. Chemical burns are most likely to\\ncome from strong acids, alkalis, phenols, or phosphorus.\\nElectrical burns may be quite severe due to the high heat\\ngenerated by electric currents.\\nDiagnosis\\nA physician will diagnose a burn based upon visual\\nexamination, and will ask questions to determine the his-\\ntory of contact with possible sources of damage. De-\\npending on the circumstances, there should be an evalua-\\ntion of the condition of the lungs and breathing, related\\ninjuries, evidence of any suspected child abuse, and the\\nextent and location of the burn. Shock and infection are\\noften the results of moderate and major burns, and\\nshould be included in any evaluation.\\nTreatment\\nA number of herbal remedies, applied topically, can\\nhelp mild burns heal. These include aloe (Aloe bar-\\nbadensis or Aloe vera ), St. John’s wort ,( Hypericum\\nperforatum) Calendula officinalis, comfrey root (Sym-\\nphytum officinale), and tea tree oil (Melaleuca spp.)\\nNutritional support is particularly important for burn\\nvictims. Supplementing the diet with vitamins A, C, and\\nE,zinc and B-complex, essential fatty acids (omega-3\\nand omego-6) and eating foods high in these nutrients\\ncan be very beneficial to the healing process. Proteins\\nand fluid intake should be increased to replace losses.\\nThe traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) approach\\nrecommends foods that remove heat and toxins, nourish\\nyin, and promote the production of body fluids. These\\nfoods include mung beans, kidney beans, lima beans,\\nsoybeans, cucumbers, potatoes, summer squash, sweet\\npotatoes, and barley. In addition, freshly juiced ginger,\\npotatoes, and cucumbers can be applied to burns to re-\\nduce pain and swelling. The pulp of fresh pumpkin can\\nbe used as a poultice (soft compress applied to the affect-\\ned area).

Ten drops should be\\nadded to one ounce of water and applied to the burn\\nthree times daily. Arnica montana 30c can help prevent\\nshock. Urtica urens 6c and Causticum 6c may also be\\nuseful for burns. Urtica may be applied to the skin as an\\nointment as well.\\nGuided imagery can assist with pain control.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nBurn treatment usually consists of relieving pain,\\npreventing infection, and maintaining body fluids, elec-\\ntrolytes, and calorie intake while the body heals. Chil-\\ndren and the elderly are more vulnerable to complica-\\ntions from burn injuries and require more intensive care.\\nOther factors that influence treatment include associated\\ninjuries such as bone fractures and smoke inhalation,\\npresence of a chronic disease, a history of abuse, and the\\noccurrence of shock or infection. Moderate and major\\nburns should always be treated by a medical practitioner.\\nThe first act of treating a burn is to stop the burning\\nprocess. Small thermal burns should be immediately\\nplaced in cold water if possible. To avoid infection, the\\nwound should be cleaned with soap and water, and all dirt\\nshould be carefully removed. Butter, shortening, or simi-\\nlar salve should never be applied to the burn since it pre-\\nvents heat from escaping and drives the burning process\\ndeeper into the skin. Minor burns should be cleaned gen-\\ntly with soap and water. If the skin is broken or apt to be\\ndisturbed, the burned area should be coated lightly with\\nan antibacterial ointment and covered with a sterile ban-\\ndage. Pain relievers such as aspirin or non-steroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used as needed. A\\ndoctor should be consulted if signs of infection appear:\\nincreased warmth, redness, pain, or swelling; pus or simi-\\nlar drainage from the wound; swollen lymph nodes; or\\nred streaks spreading from the burn.\\nAt an accident site, the victim should be immediate-\\nly removed from the burning process. Clothing should be\\nremoved from all affected areas. Any clothing embedded\\nin the burn should not be disturbed. Dry chemicals\\nshould be brushed from the skin; burns caused by acids,\\nalkalis, phosphorus, or organic compounds, such as phe-\\nnols and cresols, should be flushed with water continu-\\nously over an extended time.\\nIn cases of moderate and major burn damage, fur-\\nther medical treatment may include assessment of\\nbreathing and treatment if the patient’s airways or lungs\\nhave been damaged; a flush of any chemicals; and the\\nadministering of intravenous fluids, since burns may dra-\\nmatically deplete body fluids. Antibiotic ointments are\\nusually applied to burns, and the patient is also given an-\\ntibiotics intravenously to prevent infection. A tetanus\\nshot may also be given. Dead tissue is surgically re-\\nmoved, or debrided. Once the burned area is cleaned and\\ntreated, it is usually covered with sterile bandages. Oral\\nnarcotics such as codeine may be required for pain relief.\\nThe burn patient may have to undergo physical and oc-\\ncupational therapy. If there is extensive scarring, a skin\\ngraft is usually performed.\\nExpected results\\nPrognosis is dependent upon the degree of the burn,\\nthe amount of body surface covered, whether critical\\nbody parts are affected, any additional injuries or com-\\nplications, and the promptness of medical treatment. The\\nepidermis in first-degree burns regenerates rapidly; not\\nmuch scarring results unless infection develops. With\\ndeeper burns, the process of healing is slow, and scars\\noften develop. This may limit mobility and function,\\nmaking physical therapy necessary. In some cases,\\nsurgery may be advisable to remove scar tissue and re-\\nstore appearance. Some people, especially young women\\nand people with dark skin, may develop keloids.\\nSecondary infections are common, and may be a\\nmajor cause of loss of function, disfigurement, and\\ndeath. Patients with burns over more than 40% BSA,\\nthose older than 60 years old, and those with inhalation\\ninjuries are at risk for burn injuries that result in death.\\nPrevention\\nBurns are commonly received from fires in the\\nhome. Properly placed and working smoke detectors in\\ncombination with rapid evacuation plans will minimize a\\nperson’s exposure to smoke and flames in the event of a\\nfire. Children must be taught never to play with matches,\\nlighters, fireworks, gasoline or cleaning fluids.\\nBurns from scalding with hot water or other liquids\\nmay be prevented by setting the water heater thermostat\\nno higher than 120°F (49°C), checking the temperature\\nof bath water before getting into the tub, and turning pot\\nhandles on the stove out of the reach of children. Care\\nshould be used when removing covers from pans of\\nsteaming foods and when uncovering or opening foods\\nheated in a microwave oven.\\nSunburns may be avoided by the liberal use of sun-\\nscreen. Hats, loose clothing, and umbrellas also provide\\nprotection, especially between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., when\\nthe most damaging ultraviolet rays are present.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2324\\nBurns\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 324'),\n",

Bursae cushion the move-\\nments between the bones, tendons and muscles near the\\njoints. Bursitis is most often caused by repetitive move-\\nment and is known by several common names, including\\nweaver’s bottom, clergyman’s knee, housemaid’s knee,\\nand miner’s elbow, depending on the area of injury.\\nDescription\\nThere are over 150 bursae in the human body. Usual-\\nly bursae are present from birth, but they may form in re-\\nsponse to repeated pressure. Each sac contains a small\\namount of synovial fluid, a clear liquid that acts as a lubri-\\ncant. The bursae may become inflamed through traumatic\\ninjury, infection, or the development of arthritis. The in-\\nflammation then causes pain whenever the joint is moved.\\nThe most common site for bursitis to occur is the shoulder\\njoint (subdeltoid), but it also is seen in the elbows (olecra-\\nnon), hips (trochanteric), knees, heels (Achilles), and toes.\\nThe affected area may be referred to as “frozen,” because\\nmovement is so limited. In the knee there are four bursae,\\nand all can become inflamed with overuse.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe most common cause of bursitis is repeated\\nphysical activity, but it can flare up for no known reason.\\nIt can also be caused by trauma, rheumatoid arthritis,\\ngout, and acute or chronic infection.\\nPain and tenderness are common symptoms of bur-\\nsitis. If the affected joint is close to the skin, as with the\\nshoulder, knee, elbow, or Achilles tendon, swelling and\\nredness are seen and the area may feel warm to the\\ntouch. The bursae around the hip joint are deeper, and\\nswelling is not as obvious. Movement may be limited\\nand is painful. In the shoulder, it may be difficult to raise\\nBurns are often received from electrical appliances.\\nCare should be exercised around stoves, space heaters,\\nirons, and curling irons. Electrical burns may be prevent-\\ned by covering unused outlets with safety plugs and\\nkeeping electrical cords away from infants and toddlers\\nwho might chew on them.\\nChemical burns may be prevented by wearing pro-\\ntective clothing, including gloves and eye shields.

R. aculeatus is a common evergreen shrub native\\nto Mediterranean countries. It is related to asparagus. The\\nshrub grows to less than 3 ft (1 m) in height and about the\\nsame size in girth in shady, moist, uncultivated ground.\\nIts leaves are small and laced with brown membranes.\\nThe root, which is the medicinal part, is fleshy. Butcher’s\\nof the affected joint area is the first step. A sling can be\\nused for a shoulder injury; a cane is helpful for hip\\nproblems. The patient can take nonsteroidal anti-in-\\nflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like aspirin, ibuprofen,\\nand naproxen to relieve the pain and inflammation.\\nOnce the pain decreases, exercises of the affected area\\ncan begin. If the nearby muscles have become weak be-\\ncause of the disease or prolonged immobility, then ex-\\nercises to build strength and improve movement are\\nbest. A doctor or physical therapist can prescribe an ef-\\nfective regimen.\\nIf the bursitis is related to an inflammatory condi-\\ntion like arthritis or gout, then management of that dis-\\nease is needed to control the bursitis.\\nWhen bursitis does not respond to conservative\\ntreatment, an injection into the joint of a long-acting cor-\\nticosteroid preparation like prednisone can bring imme-\\ndiate and lasting relief. The drug is mixed with a local\\nanesthetic and works on the joint within five minutes.\\nUsually one injection is all that is needed.\\nSurgery to remove the damaged bursa may be per-\\nformed in extreme cases.\\nIf the bursitis is caused by an infection, then addi-\\ntional treatment is needed. Septic bursitis is caused by\\nthe presence of a pus-forming organism, usually Staphy-\\nlococcus aureus. Septic bursitis requires treatment with\\nantibiotics, which can be taken by mouth, injected into a\\nmuscle, or injected directly into a vein (intravenously).\\nThe bursa will also need to be drained by needle two or\\nthree times over the first week of treatment.\\nExpected results\\nBursitis usually responds well to treatment, but it\\nmay develop into a chronic condition if the underlying\\ncause is not corrected.\\nPrevention\\nAggravating factors should be eliminated to prevent\\nbursitis. Overexercising or the repetition of a movement\\nthat triggers the condition should be avoided. Doing ex-\\nercises to strengthen the muscles around the joint will\\nalso help. When doing repetitive tasks, the patient should\\ntake frequent breaks and alternate the repetitive activity\\nwith others that use different parts of the body. To cush-\\nion the joints, it is a good idea to use cushioned chairs\\nwhen sitting and foam kneeling pads for the knees.\\nLeaning on the elbows, kneeling, or sitting on a hard sur-\\nface for a long period of time should be avoided. Not\\nwearing high heels can help prevent bursitis in the heel,\\nas can changing to new running shoes as soon as the old\\nones are worn out.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 327\\nButcher’s broom\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nArthritis—Inflammation of a joint that may lead to\\nchanges in the joint’s structure.

He\\ncalled this habit Hidden Hyperventilation, which he ob-\\nserved to be prevalent. Professor Buteyko claimed to\\ncure patients of respiratory disorders by correcting their\\nbreathing to more shallow and slower patterns. He also\\ndid scientific studies to study the mechanisms of over-\\nbreathing’s negative effects n the body.\\nButeyko concluded that over-breathing causes an\\nimbalance in the carbon dioxide levels in the body (espe-\\ncially lungs and bloodstream), which in turn changes\\nblood oxygen levels and decreases the amount of oxygen\\nthat cells receive. Body acidity/alkalinity balance can\\nalso be influenced by breathing pattern, and CO2/O2 con-\\ncentrations. In time, over-breathing can stress the sys-\\ntems of the body including the respiratory, circulatory,\\nand nervous systems. According to Buteyko, breathing\\ndifficulties such as asthma are believed to be symptoms\\nof over-breathing, and are in fact the body’s natural reac-\\ntion to reduce the intake of air into the lungs. For\\nButeyko, many diseases were viewed as the body’s reac-\\ntion to over-breathing. Buteyko also believed that over-\\nbreathing was a bad habit that people learned, citing the\\nprevailing beliefs in in Russian society that deep breath-\\ning was good for the body and the nerves. He also identi-\\nfied improper breathing habits as being caused by the ex-\\ncess consumption of protein, which requires increased\\nmetabolism for digestion and thus deeper breathing.\\nOther causes of improper breathing habits include stress\\nand a sedentary lifestyle\\nButeyko claimed that many symptoms are caused by\\nover-breathing, including bronchial spasms, excess\\nmucus, nervous problems,dizziness, headaches, and al-\\nlergies. Buteyko also theorized that over-breathing is di-\\nrectly linked to many diseases including asthma, hyper-\\ntension , heart disease , strokes, hemorrhoids , and\\neczema. Buteyko’s philosophy of medicine was, “Hav-\\ning not found the reason [cause] of the disease, the\\nphysician has no right to treat the patient. Only having\\ndiscovered the reason for the disease, is it possible to\\nguarantee recovery.” For Buteyko, deepbreathing was the\\ncause of many diseases, and the bad habit could be easily\\nreplaced by a healthier pattern. He developed a tech-\\nnique to recondition breathing patterns, and demonstrat-\\ned success in healing some diseases and conditions with\\nthe breathing technique. Buteyko’s method was met with\\nresistance from the mainstream Russian medical system,\\nand his findings were resisted and suppressed, until other\\ndoctors observed and agreed with its beneficial effects\\nfor asthma sufferers. In the 1990s one of Buteyko’s\\npupils, Alexander Stalmatski, went to Australia to train\\npractitioners in the Buteyko method.

The method is also used for other respi-\\nratory conditions including bronchitis and emphysema.\\nDescription\\nDuring an attack, asthma sufferers breathe about\\ntwice as fast as people without the condition, which is\\nknown as hyperventilation The Buteyko method aims to\\ncorrect the breathing pattern, thereby maintaining bal-\\nance body CO2 and cellular oxygenation levels. With\\ncareful and consistent practice of the technique, asthma\\nsufferers can retrain their breathing patterns and often\\nimprove their symptoms of the disease.\\nThe Buteyko method strives to remove the bad\\nhabits of over-breathing and to replace them with new\\nhabits of slower, shallower breathing, called “reduced\\nbreathing.” Emphasis is placed on posture and relax-\\nation in the upper body. Proper breathing technique is\\none in which the navel and lower ribcage move out slow-\\nly during inspiration and move inward during a relaxed\\nexpiration. People are taught to avoid breathing through\\nthe mouth as much as possible, taking breaths through\\nthe nostrils even during exercise and sleep.\\nDuring training for reduced breathing, the pulse is\\nmonitored as a feedback signal: shallow and efficient\\nbreathing reduces the pulse and heart rate. During train-\\ning, there is also attention to what is called a controlled\\npause, in which breathing stops and the duration of paus-\\ning the breath is recorded and extended through practice\\n. In correct Buteyko breathing, the body can maintain a\\ncontrolled pause of 40 to 60 seconds. For asthma suffer-\\ners, the controlled pause is typically only 5 to 15 sec-\\nonds; through habituation to the technique the controlled\\npause can be held for much longer.\\nWhen the technique is effectively practiced and re-\\nduced breathing becomes habitual, fewer allergens are\\ninhaled and the airways become less dehydrated and irri-\\ntated. Mucus and histamine production decreases, in-\\nflammation decreases, and breathing becomes easier.\\nPreparation\\nPeople seeking to learn the Buteyko method are en-\\ncouraged to find a certified practitioner or class. Books\\nand videos are available that give step-by-step instruc-\\ntions in the technique.\\nPrecautions\\nAsthma sufferers learning the technique should con-\\ntinue use of their asthma medication; but may taper\\ndown with dosages under their doctors’ supervision. \\nSide Effects\\nNo unfavorable side effects with the technique have\\nbeen observed.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThe Buteyko method has not gained widespread\\npopularity in the United States. The technique is more\\nprevalent in Australia and England. Conclusive scientific\\nstudies of the method have yet to be conducted.\\nIn Australia two studies have pointed to the effective-\\nness of the technique for asthma. In Brisbane, a group of\\nasthma sufferers taught the Buteyko method were able to\\nreduce the use of bronchodilators by 90 percent after six\\nweeks, compared to 5 percent of the control group, and re-\\nduced the use of steroids by nearly 50 percent after 12\\nweeks. Another study at Victoria University showed that,\\n12 weeks after learning the Buteyko method, asthma suf-\\nfers were able to reduce medication by 92 percent. Two\\nclinical trials in Russia pointed to the method’s success for\\nasthma treatment.

While spontaneous recovery from\\nmild cadmium exposure is common, doses as low as 10\\nmilligrams can cause symptoms of poisoning. There is\\nno accepted fatal dose amount.\\nDescription\\nThe symptoms of ingested cadmium poisoning are:\\n• increased salivation\\n• choking\\n• vomiting\\n• abdominal pain\\n• anemia\\n• painful spasms of the anal sphincter\\nWhen cadmium dust or powder is inhaled, the first\\nsymptoms are a sweet or metallic taste, followed by\\nthroat irritation. Other symptoms that may appear in\\nthree to five hours include:\\n• dry throat\\n• cough\\n• headache\\n• vomiting\\n• chest pain\\n• pulmonary edema, a congestive lung condition\\n• bronchospasm, the abnormal tightening of airways that\\nmay be accompanied by wheezing and coughing\\n• pneumonitis, inflammation of the lung\\n• muscle weakness\\n• leg pain\\nWhen a person has exposure to cadmium in low\\ndoses over a long period of time, symptoms may include\\nloss of sense of smell, cough, shortness of breath, weight\\nloss, and tooth staining. Chronic cadmium exposure may\\ncause damage to the liver and kidneys.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe most common cause of cadmium poisoning is a\\nlack of proper precautions in places where cadmium is\\nused. In such industries, air quality should be regularly\\nmonitored. Cadmium-plated containers should never be\\nused to store acidic foods such as fruit juices or vinegar.\\nFossil fuels, such as coal and oil, release cadmium\\nfumes into the air.

He-\\nmodialysis may be used to remove circulating cadmium\\nfrom the bloodstream, although the literature on the sub-\\nject is scarce. Addition of a chelating agent, particularly\\nethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), will increase\\nthe amount of cadmium removed by the dialysate (the\\nfluid used in dialysis to carry substances to or remove\\nfrom the kidney during hemodialysis).\\nThese treatments are only effective for oral poison-\\ning, and have no demonstrated benefit in cadmium fume\\ninhalation.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThere are no generally accepted treatments for the acute\\neffects of cadmium poisoning. Other than dialysis, dimer-\\ncaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) (an oral chelating agent), has\\nbeen recommended for removal of cadmium from the blood.\\nExpected results\\nThe prognosis depends on the nature and severity of\\nthe cadmium load.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 354}, page_content='Calcarea carbonica is one of the three most impor-\\ntant remedies, along with Lycopodium and Sulphur in the\\ntraditional homeopath’s medicine chest because all three\\nare antipsoric remedies. The term antipsoric is derived\\nfrom Hahnemann’s theory of miasms. In homeopathy, a\\nmiasm is an inherited fundamental weakness or predis-\\nposition to chronic diseases. Hahnemann thought that the\\nmost ancient and universal miasm, the one that underlay\\nthe majority of the chronic illnesses that afflict humans,\\nis the psoric miasm, or Psora. To define a remedy as an-\\ntipsoric is to say that it is capable of healing a basic\\nsource of constitutional vulnerability to disease. Because\\nCalcarea carbonicais an antipsoric remedy, it is also a\\npolychrest remedy. Polychrest is the term used in home-\\nopathy for a remedy that has many uses. Calcarea car-\\nbonica is used to treat a variety of diseases and disorders\\nsuch as acne, arthritis, vaginal discharges in women,\\nnight terrors in children, and ringworm on the scalp.\\nCalcarea carbonica is in general considered a\\n“chilly” remedy, appropriate for people who suffer keen-\\nly from the cold and have difficulty keeping warm. A\\nhomeopathic practitioner who is asking a patient about\\nsymptoms will inquire about the circumstances (e.g.,\\nlight or dark, heat or cold, rest or activity, etc.) that make\\nthe patient feel better or worse. These factors are called\\nmodalities in homeopathy. In terms of modalities, pa-\\ntients who need Calcarea carbonica feel worse when\\nthey are cold. They may complain of a cold sensation in\\nthe abdomen and cold, clammy feet at night. Dampness,\\nactivity, and fright also make them feel worse. They feel\\nbetter when they are warm and lying down.\\nOther aspects of Calcarea carbonica patients that\\nare noted in the homeopathic literature are their tendency\\nto tire easily, to move slowly and sluggishly, to sweat\\nreadily, and to have poor muscle tone and swollen lymph\\nnodes. As a rule, they are passive, overweight people\\nwith fair or chalky complexions, large heads, and large\\npuffy abdomens. They appear to be bloated rather than\\nsolidly muscular. Their perspiration and other body dis-\\ncharges often have a sour smell. Women may have ex-\\ncessively heavy menstrual periods (menorrhagia) and\\nsore breasts before the flow begins. Calcarea carbonica\\npatients often crave cold or iced drinks even when they\\ndo not have much appetite. On the other hand, they may\\nhave cravings for indigestible nonfood items, such as\\ncoal or chalk. They may dislike milk or meat, and com-\\nplain of headaches and nausea after meals.\\nThe intellectual constitution of Calcarea carbonica\\npatients is marked by the same slowness and lack of en-\\nergy that characterizes their physical movements. They\\nmay complain of heaviness or sensations of pressure in\\nthe head when they are asked to do anything requiring\\nintellectual effort. Children with a Calcarea carbonica\\nconstitution are slow to teethe and to walk, but they are\\nalso likely to be stubborn and strong-willed. Emotional-\\nly,Calcarea carbonica patients tend to be afraid of the\\ndark, of isolation, of getting sick, and of going insane.\\nPreparations\\nCalcarea carbonica is available in tablet form as a\\nsingle remedy, and in a number of combination reme-\\ndies. Since it is a polychrest remedy, it is manufactured\\nby all major suppliers of homeopathic medicines, and\\ncan be easily purchased from homeopathic pharmacies\\nor over the Internet.\\nPrecautions\\nIn homeopathy, most precautions about the remedies\\nconcern proper storage and administration rather than\\nexcluding certain types of patients. Homeopathic practi-\\ntioners believe that remedies lose their power from expo-\\nsure to heat, light, or other substances. Guidelines for\\nproper storage of homeopathic remedies include keeping\\nthem away from strong sunlight and high temperatures,\\nkeeping them in their original containers, and not storing\\nthem near perfumes, bleach, or other strong-smelling\\nsubstances. In addition, patients under care of a home-\\nopath are instructed to avoid coffee or products contain-\\ning camphor (lip balms, chest rubs, etc.) during a period\\nof homeopathic treatment and for two days after the last\\ndose. Homeopaths believe that these substances counter-\\nact or “antidote” the effects of homeopathic remedies.\\nPrecautions regarding homeopathic remedies also in-\\nclude avoiding contamination of the medicine. The patient\\nshould not touch the medicine; it should be dispensed into\\na cup and tipped directly into the mouth. Homeopathic\\nremedies are not taken with water but allowed to dissolve\\nin the mouth. Patients are asked not to eat or drink for\\nabout 20 minutes before and after each dose.\\nSide effects\\nCalcarea carbonica , like other homeopathic reme-\\ndies, has so little of the original substance in the tablets\\nthat it is highly unlikely to produce side effects in the\\nusual sense. In addition, because Calcarea carbonica is\\ngiven more often for constitutional treatment than for\\nacute illnesses, it is not as likely to produce the tempo-\\nrary worsening of the patient’s symptoms known as ag-\\ngravation.\\nInteractions\\nHomeopathic remedies are so dilute that they are\\nhighly unlikely to interact with allopathic medications.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2338\\nCalcarea carbonica\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 338'),\n",

Calcium is beneficial to everyone, but re-\\nsearch has shown that women may benefit more than\\nothers. A study in the October 1999 issue of the journal\\nObstetrics & Gynecologyfound that pregnant women\\nwho do not get enough calcium in their diet can increase\\nthe bone mineral content of their fetus by about 15% by\\ntaking 1,300 mg of a calcium supplement per day during\\ntheir second and third trimesters. For those women who\\nalready consume enough calcium, the additional supple-\\nments do not have this effect. Additional research shows\\nthat calcium deficiencies lead to preeclampsia during\\npregnancy, causing high blood pressure, swelling, and\\nweight gain greater than 1 lb (0.5 kg) per day. The risk of\\npreeclampsia developing lowers by 45–75% for women\\nwho receive calcium supplementation.\\nPremenstrual syndrome(PMS) is another condition\\nwomen face that may be alleviated by the use of calcium\\nsupplements. Researchers at the National Institute of Men-\\ntal Health (NIMH) concluded that those women who took\\n1,200 mg of calcium per day reduced their overall PMS\\nsymptoms by more than 50%. In the study, calcium supple-\\nmentation led to the reduction of psychological PMS\\nsymptoms (such as mood swings) by 45%, food cravings\\nby 54%, and bloating and water retention by 36%.\\nA 1999 study reported that researchers have found\\nthat increasing the amount of daily calcium consumed by\\nwomen may reduce their risk of stroke. Those women in\\nthe Nurses’ Health Study who took more than 400 mg of\\ncalcium daily were at the lowest risk for a stroke, while\\nthose who consumed more than 600 mg each day did not\\nhave an increased benefit. Researchers believe that the\\nrisk of stroke is reduced by calcium from decreased cho-\\nlesterol levels, or by stopping the formation of blood\\nclots that cause strokes.\\nFor elderly postmenopausal women, the prevention\\nof osteoporosis becomes critical. In order to maintain\\nbone mass during this time, a study conducted in 1999\\nconcluded that a low-dose hormone replacement therapy\\n(HRT) combined with calcium and vitamin D supple-\\nmentation is an effective therapeutic option for preven-\\ntion of osteoporosis. Estriol, which is used in HRT, ap-\\npears to be helpful in controlling menopausal symptoms.\\nResults from research regarding this use of estriol on\\nbone density have been contradictory, according to the\\nAlternative Medicine Review,with the results showing\\nthe most effectiveness coming from Japanese studies.\\nCalcium alone is frequently prescribed with estro-\\ngen at the beginning of menopause to treat or prevent\\nosteoporosis. This therapy is recommended to guard\\nagainst the increased loss of calcium in the bones due to\\nincreasing age. As bones lose more calcium they become\\ndense and brittle, and more vulnerable to the attack of\\nosteoporosis. This condition is most common in people\\nover 70, and in women after menopause, where it may\\nincrease the risk of broken hips, ribs, and pelvis, and the\\nweakening of other bones. Increased physical exercise is\\nalso important for bone strengthening.\\nOn the other hand, although calcium supplementation\\nis useful in lowering the risk of osteoporosis in Western\\nwomen, more research is needed to determine why the\\nrates of osteoporosis are low in some Eastern societies\\nwith low-calcium diets. There is evidence that osteoporo-\\nsis, like coronary artery disease, is primarily a problem in\\nWestern societies. In addition, accumulating evidence that\\na diet high in fruits and vegetables helps to prevent frac-\\ntures suggests that the level of calcium in the diet is not\\nthe only nutritional factor involved in osteoporosis.\\nCalcium has been shown to be beneficial to the\\ncolon. Among those people taking calcium supplements,\\nresearch points to a modest reduction in the recurrence of\\npolyps in their colons. Colon polyps are benign tumors\\nthat often turn cancerous. Researchers think that calcium\\nbinds to carcinogens, preventing abnormal cell growth.\\nStemming from its active role in building bone den-\\nsity throughout the body, calcium may prove particularly\\nbeneficial for strengthening of the jawbone. Dental re-\\nsearchers at the State University of New York at Buffalo\\nreport that calcium supplementation may prevent peri-\\nodontal disease as it builds a strong jawbone. Periodon-\\ntal, or gum, disease is an infection caused by bacteria\\nthat deposits in pockets between the teeth and gums, and\\nis the leading cause of tooth loss in the United States. As\\nthe infection progresses, the jawbone that holds a tooth\\nin place is eventually destroyed, causing the tooth to\\nloosen and fall out. The researchers contend that calci-\\num’s overall bone-building role would equal a stronger\\njawbone that would better fight off gum disease.\\nWhile supplements of calcium can be found in many\\nforms, research has shown a promising benefit if it is ob-\\ntained from dairy foods, rather than supplements or leafy\\ngreens—calcium in the form of dairy may actually pre-\\nvent weight gain. Those in the study who consumed at\\nleast 1,000 mg of calcium a day (equaling about 3 cups,\\nor 750 ml of skim milk), gained 6–7 lb (2.7–3.2 kg) less\\nover two years than those with low-calcium diets. Re-\\nsearchers of Purdue University speculate that calcium\\nprobably prevents weight gain by increasing the break-\\ndown of body fat and decreasing its formation. It is im-\\nportant to note, however, that dairy products should be\\nconsumed in moderation, as other research conducted\\nhas indicated that dairy products are not necessarily a\\ngood source of absorbable calcium.

The report list-\\ned increased consumption of soft drinks and decreased\\nconsumption of milk as contributing to the problem.\\nPreparations\\nCalcium may be supplemented in the diet in a vari-\\nety of ways. Numerous foods are rich in calcium, includ-\\ning dairy products (such as milk, yogurt, and cheese) and\\nleafy green vegetables like turnip greens, broccoli, kale,\\nand collards. Canned salmon, sardines, shrimp, and tofu\\nare also high in calcium. More foods are being fortified\\nwith calcium, making it easier to ensure the proper\\namount of the mineral is consumed. Calcium-fortified\\nfoods range from cranberry juice cocktail, cereal and\\nwaffles, to orange juice and flour. With almost every seg-\\nment of the population consuming too little calcium, re-\\nsearchers recommend calcium-fortified foods to increase\\ndaily calcium intake.\\nWhile the types of food calcium may be obtained\\nfrom continues to increase, most people still lack enough\\nof the essential mineral. For those who are not getting\\nenough calcium from foods, supplements are an accept-\\nable alternative. The chemical form of calcium supple-\\nments come in five varieties: carbonate, citrate, lactate,\\nphosphate, chelate, and citrate malate. The supplements\\nare available as tablets, syrup, or suspension form. Calci-\\num supplements should be stored at room temperature\\nand away from moisture and sunlight. It should not be\\nstored in the bathroom, and the liquid forms should not\\nbe frozen.\\nExperts state that calcium is best absorbed from the\\ncitrate malate form, or the type of calcium found in some\\njuices, but they recommend calcium carbonate for the\\noverall amount of calcium it offers and its affordability.\\nCalcium carbonate can be found in antacids, and it is ab-\\nsorbed better when taken with meals. Food slows down\\nthe time it takes substances to travel through the gut, giv-\\ning the calcium more time to be absorbed. Absorption is\\nkey for the proper functioning of calcium. Sufficient lev-\\nels of vitamin D and hydrochloric acid in the stomach,\\nand the presence of other minerals, such as magnesium\\nand phosphorous are essential for quick absorption.\\nThe body may also be better able to absorb calcium\\nwhen taken along with ingredients extracted from chico-\\nry root. Research indicates that Raftilin inulin and\\nRaftilose oligofructose, both extracts from chicory root,\\nare dietary fibers that are not digested in the stomach or\\nthe small intestine. Instead, they are fermented by Bifi-\\ndobacteria in the colon—beneficially leading to in-\\ncreased calcium absorption throughout the body, with\\nemphasis on bone tissue. Additionally, Oligofructose im-\\nproves the texture and mouthfeel while improving taste\\nand fruit flavors in low-fat yogurts. Inulin is used for fat\\nreplacement and fiber enrichment of reduced-fat and fat-\\nfree sour cream and whipped topping.\\nThere are many ways to ensure calcium is part of a\\ndaily diet, but it is important that the recommended daily\\nallowance (RDA), or appropriate dosage of the mineral\\nbe followed. The RDA of calcium for adults is 800 mg;\\npregnant women and young adults should be certain\\ntheir intake equals 1,200 mg per day. Adults over 50\\nshould increase their intake to 1,000 mg per day with\\nsupplements that include vitamin D.\\nCalcium supplements may be taken with a large\\nglass of water during or after a meal. Tablets in chewable\\nform must be chewed thoroughly before swallowing, and\\neffervescent tablets should be diluted in cold water or\\njuice before taking. It is recommended that other med-\\nications be taken two hours after any calcium supple-\\nment. The simultaneous intake of calcium may interfere\\nwith the absorption of other drugs. Do not take more\\nthan 500 mg of calcium at one time for the best absorp-\\ntion of the mineral.\\nPrecautions\\nWhen adding calcium supplements to the diet, it is\\nrecommended that it not be taken within one to two hours\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 341\\nCalcium\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 341'),\n",

Frey, PhD\\nCalendula\\nDescription\\nCalendula ( Calendula officinalis ) is also known as\\ngarden marigold, holligold, goldbloom, golds, ruddes,\\nMary bud, bull’s eyes, and pot marigold. It is a member\\nof the Asteraceae family. Other members of this plant\\nfamily include daisies,arnica, chamomile, and yarrow.\\nThis bright, flowering herb opens its gold blossoms in\\nthe morning and closes them at dusk, or when rain\\nthreatens. Calendula is native to Asia and southern and\\ncentral Europe. Early settlers brought the herb to North\\nAmerica where it has become a garden favorite. It is cul-\\ntivated throughout the world and valued for its culinary\\nand medicinal uses. The first name,Calendula , is from\\nthe Latin kalendae , the word Romans used to indicate\\nthat it bloomed throughout the year in their area. The\\nsecond name officinalis indicates that calendula was in-\\ncluded in official lists of medicinal herbs. The common\\nname marigold refers to the blossoms’ association with\\nthe Virgin Mary.\\nCalendula is a familiar garden plant with yellow or\\norange-gold blooms that have a strong and distinctive\\nscent. The plant likes sun and will re-seed from year to\\nyear, even in poor soil. The erect, square and branching\\nstems emerge from a taproot to grow up to 2 ft (0.6 m)\\nhigh. The lower leaves are broad and spatula shaped.\\nUpper leaves may be oblong, are smooth at the edges,\\nand are arranged alternately along the stem. Blossoms\\nmay be single or double, are 1–4 in (2.54–10.2 cm)\\nacross, and are made of many small florets. The bushy\\nherb blooms continuously throughout the summer. Seeds\\nare crescent to horseshoe shaped with a rough exterior.\\nGeneral use\\nCalendula has been used for centuries as a culinary,\\nmedicinal, and magical herb. It was believed that calendu-\\nla could bring protection against dangerous influences.\\nThe seventeenth century astrologer and doctor, Nicholas\\nCulpeper, taught that the marigolds were under the influ-\\nence of the constellation Leo. The flowers, he said were “a\\ncomforter of the heart and spirits.” The bright yellow blos-\\nsom of this herb was used to make a dye to color cheese\\nand butter. In the kitchen, leaves and florets were added to\\nsauces, soups, porridge, and puddings for color and medi-\\ncinal benefit. The dried, powdered blossoms have also\\nbeen used as a substitute for saffron in cooking. During\\nthe Civil War, calendula was used to stop the blood flow\\nfrom battle wounds. Calendula blossom preparations con-\\ntinue to be valued as an antiseptic for external application\\nto scrapes,burns, cuts, or wounds. Local application, in\\nthe form of a plant poultice or an infusion soaked in a\\ncloth and applied to a wound, is an effective healing reme-\\ndy. The Romans valued the herb for its ability to break\\nfevers. During the Middle Ages, calendula used for pro-\\ntection against the plague. In early American Shaker med-\\nicine, calendula was a treatment for gangrene.\\nIn addition to its first aid uses, calendula also acts as a\\ndigestive remedy. An infusion or tincture of the flowers,\\ntaken internally, is beneficial in the treatment of ulcers,\\nstomach cramps, colitis, herpes viruses, yeast infections,\\nand diarrhea. An infusion may also be used as an external\\nwash helpful in treating bee stings, eye inflammations,\\nboilsand abscesses, varicose veins, eczema, acne, and as\\na gargle for mouth sores or a rinse to relieve toothache.\\nThe flowers have antispasmodic, antimicrobial, and antivi-\\nral properties. They improve the circulation of the blood\\nand the lymphatic fluids and aid in elimination of toxins\\nfrom the body. The juice from the fresh flowers or stem is\\nsaid to help remove warts and help heal mucous mem-\\nbranes and skin. An infusion or tincture of the herb is also\\nhelpful in cases of painful or delayed menstruation, and\\nthe herb is a beneficial ally in the transition to menopause.\\nThe tincture also has many other uses, such as a topical\\nwash for diaper rashin infants, a mouth gargle for sores, a\\nvaginal douche for yeast, an internal soother for inflamed\\nlungs, a topical for hemorrhoids, etc.\\nDespite a large number of studies on the chemical\\nconstituents of calendula flowers, the agents responsible\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 343\\nCalendula\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 343'),\n",

It is a genetic disease, with two\\nmain characteristics of uncontrolled growth of the cells\\nin the human body and the ability of those cells to mi-\\ngrate from the original site and spread to distant sites.\\nDescription\\nOne out of every four deaths in the United States is\\nfrom cancer. It is second only to heart disease as a cause\\nof death in the United States. About 1.2 million Ameri-\\ncans are expected to be diagnosed with cancer each year,\\nof which more than 500,000 are diagnosed as terminally\\nill. Cancer can attack anyone. Since the occurrence of\\ncancer increases as people age, most cases are seen in\\nadults, middle-aged or older. The most common cancers\\nare skin cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, breast can-\\ncer (in women), and prostate cancer (in men). In addi-\\ntion, cancer of the kidneys, ovaries, uterus, pancreas,\\nbladder, rectum, blood (leukemia ), and lymph nodes\\n(lymphoma) are also included among the 12 major can-\\ncers that affect most Americans.\\nCancer, by definition, is a disease of the genes. A\\ngene is a small part of DNA, which is the master mole-\\ncule of the cell. Genes make proteins, which are the ulti-\\nmate workhorses of the cells. It is these proteins, along\\nwith other substances, that allow our bodies to carry out\\nthe many processes that permit people to breathe, think,\\nmove, etc. Many genes produce proteins that are in-\\nvolved in controlling the processes of cell growth and di-\\nvision. An alteration, or mutation, to the DNA molecule\\ncan disrupt the genes and produce faulty proteins. This\\ncauses the cell to become abnormal and lose its restraints\\non growth. The abnormal cell begins to divide uncontrol-\\nlably and eventually forms a new growth known as a\\ntumor or neoplasm (medical term for cancer meaning\\n“new growth”). In a healthy individual, the immune sys-\\ntem can recognize the neoplastic cells and destroy them\\nbefore they get a chance to divide. However, some mu-\\ntant cells may escape immune detection and survive to\\nbecome tumors or cancers.\\nTumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A be-\\nnign tumor is slow growing, does not spread or invade\\nsurrounding tissue, and once removed, it does not usual-\\nly recur. A malignant tumor, on the other hand, invades\\nsurrounding tissue and has the capacity to spread to other\\nparts of the body. If the cancer cells have spread to the\\nsurrounding tissues, then, even after the primary malig-\\nnant tumor is removed, it generally recurs either locally\\nor to a distant site. A majority of cancers are caused by\\nchanges in the cell’s DNA because of damage due to the\\ncell’s environment. Environmental factors that are re-\\nsponsible for causing the initial mutation in the DNA are\\ncalled carcinogens, and there are many types. Some can-\\ncers also have a genetic basis. In other words, an individ-\\nual could inherit faulty DNA from a patient’s parents,\\nwhich could predispose the patient to getting cancer.\\nThere is also the two “hit” theory, where there is a com-\\nbination of a genetic mutation and a stimulation of cell\\ndivision and/or replication, due to environmental circum-\\nstances. While this scientific evidence points to both fac-\\ntors (environmental and genetic) playing a role, less than\\n10% of all cancers are purely hereditary. Cancers that are\\nknown to have a hereditary link are breast cancer, colon\\ncancer,ovarian cancer , and uterine cancer . In late\\n2001, scientists took one step closer to identifying genet-\\nic markers that indicate cancer susceptibility. Called\\n“low penetrance genes,” these markers are believed to\\ncombine to increase risk for cancer.\\nThere are several different types of cancers. Carci-\\nnomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the layer\\nof cells covering the body’s surface and lining the inter-\\nnal organs and various glands). Ninety percent of human\\ncancers fall into this category. Melanomas are cancers\\nthat originate in the skin, usually in the pigment cells\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 345\\nCancer\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 345'),\n",

Eighty to ninety percent of lung cancer\\ncases occur in smokers. Smoking has also been shown to\\nbe a contributory factor in cancers of the upper respiratory\\ntract, esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably\\nliver, stomach, breast, and kidney, as well. Recently, scien-\\ntists have also shown that second-hand smoke (or passive\\nsmoking) can increase one’s risk of developing cancer.\\nAlcohol. Excessive consumption of alcohol is a risk\\nfactor in certain cancers, such as liver cancer. Alcohol, in\\ncombination with tobacco, significantly increases the\\nchances that an individual will develop mouth, pharynx,\\nlarynx, and esophageal cancers.\\nDiet. Thirty five percent of all cancers are estimated\\nto be due to dietary causes. Excessive intake of fat lead-\\ning to obesity has been associated with cancers of the\\nbreast, colon, rectum, pancreas, prostate, gall bladder,\\novaries, and uterus.\\nSexual and reproductive behavior.The human papil-\\nlomavirus, which is sexually transmitted, has been impli-\\ncated to cause cancer of the cervix. In addition, it has\\nalso been shown that women who have not had children\\nor have children late in life have an increased risk for\\nboth ovarian and breast cancer.\\nInfectious agents. In the last 20 years, scientists\\nhave obtained evidence to estimate that 15% of the\\nworld’s cancer deaths may be traced to viruses, bacteria,\\nor parasites.\\nFamily history. Certain cancers like breast, colon,\\novarian, and uterine cancer, recur generation after gener-\\nation in some families. A few cancers, such as the eye\\ncancer “retinoblastoma,” a type of colon cancer, and a\\ntype of breast cancer known as “early-onset breast can-\\ncer,” have been shown to be linked to certain genes that\\ncan be tracked within a family. It is therefore possible\\nthat inheriting particular genes makes a person suscepti-\\nble to certain cancers.\\nOccupational hazards. There is evidence to estimate\\nthat certain occupational hazards account for 4% of all\\ncancer deaths. For example, asbestos workers have an in-\\ncreased incidence of lung cancer. Similarly, a higher\\nlikelihood of getting bladder cancer is associated with\\ndye, rubber, and gas workers; skin and lung cancer with\\nsmelters, gold miners, and arsenic workers; leukemia\\nwith glue and varnish workers; liver cancer with PVC\\nmanufacturers; and lung, bone, and bone marrow cancer\\nwith radiologists and uranium miners.\\nEnvironmental radiation. Exposure is believed to\\ncause 1–2% of all cancer deaths. Ultra-violet radiation\\n(melanocytes). Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting\\ntissues of the body, such as bone, muscle, and blood ves-\\nsels. Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called\\nleukemiasand lymphomas respectively. Gliomas are can-\\ncers of the nerve tissue.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses & risk factors\\nThe major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco-\\nhol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectious\\nagents, family history, occupation, environment, and pol-\\nlution. According to the estimates of the American Can-\\ncer Society (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer\\ndeaths in 2003 were due to tobacco and excessive alco-\\nhol use.

Other sources of radiation are x rays, radon gas,\\nand ionizing radiation from nuclear material.\\nPollution. Several studies have shown that there is a\\nwell established link between asbestos and cancer. Chlo-\\nrination of water may account for a small rise in cancer\\nrisk. Studies released in 2003 showed that cadmium, a\\nnatural metal found in food, water, and cigarette smoke,\\ndisturbs a system in our cells essential to preventing can-\\ncer. The main danger from pollution occurs when dan-\\ngerous chemicals from the industries escape into the sur-\\nrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1% of\\ncancer deaths are due to air, land, and water pollution.\\nAlternative medicine tends to disagree with conven-\\ntional medicine about the causes of cancer, claiming that\\nenvironmental pollution and emotional and psychologi-\\ncal factors are major influences upon the disease. Samuel\\nS. Epstein, a professor of Occupational and Environmen-\\ntal Medicine at the University of Illinois and the chair-\\nman of the Cancer Prevention Coalition, is one of the\\nstrongest critics of the National Cancer Institute and the\\nAmerican Cancer Society (ACS). Epstein tends to echo\\nmany of the beliefs of alternative practitioners. He\\nclaims that mainstream medicine, driven by politics,\\nprofits, and pharmaceutical sales, is not discussing or\\nsufficiently researching some major factors behind can-\\ncer, or researching ways of preventing those causes. Ep-\\nstein asserts that a primary cause of cancer is the massive\\npollution of the air, water, food, and workplace. For in-\\nstance, since the 1940s over 100,000 new chemicals\\nhave been added to the environment, and each year in the\\nUnited States alone, over 10 lb (4.5 kg) of pesticides and\\nherbicides per person are used on the food supply, chem-\\nicals that are proven to be carcinogenic. Epstein believes\\nthat the human immune system simply cannot handle all\\nthe new carcinogens and stresses in the environment, and\\ncancer represents this breakdown of the immune system.\\nHe is also a critic of some conventional cancer therapies\\nlike radiation and chemotherapy, claiming that the thera-\\npies themselves are highly carcinogenic and are often re-\\nsponsible for recurrent cancer. Epstein points out that de-\\nspite the “war on cancer” by mainstream medicine, mor-\\ntality rates have not been significantly improved by its\\nmethods, and more research needs to be dedicated to\\npreventative and alternative measures instead of pharma-\\nceuticals and invasive treatments.\\nSymptoms\\nCancer is a progressive disease, and goes through\\nseveral stages with varying symptoms. Some symptoms\\nare produced early and may occur due to a tumor that is\\ngrowing within an organ or a gland. As the tumor grows,\\nit may press on the nearby nerves, organs, and blood ves-\\nsels. This causes pain and some pressure that may be the\\nearliest warning signs of cancer. Despite the fact that\\nthere are several hundred different types of cancers, pro-\\nducing very different symptoms, the ACS has established\\nthe following seven symptoms as possible warning sig-\\nnals of cancer:\\n• changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole\\n• a sore that does not heal\\n• persistent cough, hoarseness, or sore throat\\n• a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere\\n• unusual bleeding or discharge\\n• chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing\\n• any change in bowel or bladder habits\\nMany other diseases besides cancer, could produce\\nthe same symptoms. However, it is important to have\\nthese symptoms checked as soon as possible, especially\\nif they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat-\\ned, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancers,\\nsuch as breast cancer, may not have any early symptoms.\\nTherefore, it is important to undergo routine screening\\ntests, such as breast self-exams and mammograms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina-\\ntion and a complete medical history.

By focusing a light into the\\nmouth, he or she will look for abnormalities in color,\\nmoisture, surface texture, or presence of any thickening\\nor soreness in the lips, tongue, gums, the hard palate on\\nthe roof of the mouth, and the throat.\\nTo detect thyroid cancer, the doctor will observe the\\nfront of the neck for swelling. He may gently manipulate\\nthe neck and palpate the front and side surfaces of the\\nthyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) to detect\\nany nodules or tenderness. As part of the physical exami-\\nnation, the doctor will also palpate the lymph nodes in\\nthe neck, under the arms, and in the groin. Many illness-\\nes and cancers cause a swelling of the lymph nodes.\\nThe doctor may conduct a thorough examination of\\nthe skin to look for sores that have been present for more\\nthan three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust; irritated\\npatches that may itch or hurt, and any change in the size of\\na wart or a mole. Examination of the female pelvis is used\\nto detect cancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina.\\nIn the visual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal\\ndischarges or the presence of sores. Then, using gloved\\nhands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organs\\nsuch as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormal\\nmasses. Breast examination includes visual observation\\nwhere the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness, dis-\\ncoloration, or scaling. The doctor palpates both breasts to\\nfeel for masses or lumps. For males, inspection of the rec-\\ntum and the prostate is also included in the physical exam-\\nination. The doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum\\nand rotates it slowly to feel for any growths, tumors, or\\nother abnormalities. The doctor also conducts an examina-\\ntion of the testes, where the doctor observes the genital\\narea and looks for swelling or other abnormalities. The\\ntesticles are palpated to identify any lumps, thickening, or\\ndifferences in the size, weight, and firmness.\\nIf the doctor detects an abnormality on physical ex-\\namination, or the patient has some symptom that could\\nbe indicative of cancer, the doctor may order diagnostic\\ntests. Laboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology),\\nblood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that may\\nindicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where the\\nphlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopi-\\ncally examined. It is often used to detect lung cancer.\\nA blood test for cancer is easy to perform, usually\\ninexpensive and risk- free. Blood tests can be either spe-\\ncific or nonspecific. Often times, in certain cancers, the\\ncancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor\\nmarkers) and blood tests can be used to detect the pres-\\nence of these tumor markers. However, with a few ex-\\nceptions, tumor markers are not used for routine screen-\\ning of cancers, because several noncancerous conditions\\nalso produce positive results. Blood tests are generally\\nmore useful in monitoring the effectiveness of the treat-\\nment, or in following the course of the disease and de-\\ntecting recurrent disease.\\nImaging tests such as computed tomography scans\\n(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra-\\nsound, and fiberoptic scope examinations help doctors\\ndetermine the location of the tumor even if it is deep\\nwithin the body. Conventional x rays are often used for\\ninitial evaluation, because they are relatively cheap,\\npainless, and easily accessible. In order to increase the\\ninformation obtained from a conventional x ray, air or a\\ndye (such as barium or iodine) may be used as a contrast\\nmedium to outline or highlight parts of the body.\\nThe most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,\\nwherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for mi-\\ncroscope examination. Besides confirming a cancer, the\\nbiopsy also provides information about the type of can-\\ncer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of the\\ncancer, and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy pro-\\nvides the most accurate analysis, it is considered the gold\\nstandard of diagnostic tests. Screening examinations,\\nconducted regularly by healthcare professionals, can re-\\nsult in the detection of cancers of the breast, colon, rec-\\ntum, cervix, prostate, testes, tongue, mouth, and skin at\\nearly stages, when treatment is more likely to be suc-\\ncessful. Some of the routine screening tests recommend-\\ned by the ACS are sigmoidoscopy (for colorectal\\ncancer), mammography (for breast cancer), pap smear\\n(for cervical cancer), and the PSA test (for prostate can-\\ncer). Self-examinations for cancers of the breast, testes,\\nmouth, and skin can also help in detecting the tumors be-\\nfore the symptoms become serious.\\nDiagnosis in alternative treatment often relies on\\nconventional diagnostic tools for determining the type\\nand stage of cancer, but will supplement those tools with\\ndiagnostic techniques that strive to evaluate the overall\\nhealth of a person, in order to treat a person holistically.\\nFor instance, Ayurvedic medicine and traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine place high priorities during diagnosis on\\nthe patient’s emotional and psychological history, as well\\nas considerations like lifestyle, relationships, and the de-\\ngree of social and spiritual support, in order to have in-\\nsight into the cause and proper treatment of a particular\\ncancer. These alternative practices also have highly de-\\nveloped diagnostic techniques for the body, including\\npulse diagnosis; methods of analyzing the tongue, eyes,\\nskin, hair, and fingernails; palpating and finding prob-\\nlems in the organs and abdomen; and listening to the\\nbreath for clues to the internal environment.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2348\\nCancer\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 348'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 365}, page_content='Treatment\\nChoosing an alternative cancer treatment\\nThere are a multitude of alternative treatments avail-\\nable to help a person with cancer. They are usually inte-\\ngrated with allopathic treatments like surgery, chemother-\\napy, and radiation therapy, where only an estimated 4%\\nexclusively use alternative medicine. Chemotherapy and\\nradiation treatments are some of the most painful and\\ntoxic of conventional treatments, and often have unpre-\\ndictable results. As a rule, alternative treatments are less\\ninvasive, nontoxic, and have minimal side effects. When\\nused as adjuncts to conventional treatment, some alterna-\\ntive treatments have been shown to decrease pain and\\nside effects, aid in the recovery process, and improve the\\nquality of life of cancer patients.\\nAlternative treatment of cancer is a complicated\\narena and choosing one from the many can seem a diffi-\\ncult task, as can choosing an alternative practitioner. Pa-\\ntients should consult as many trained health practitioners\\nas feasible when choosing alternative therapies. If pa-\\ntients are willing to ask questions and thoroughly re-\\nsearch their options, they can increase their chances of\\ngetting the best possible alternative support for the diffi-\\ncult task of treating cancer.\\nWhen choosing alternative treatment, individuals\\nshould evaluate practitioners, therapies, and services de-\\nlivered by clinics or practitioners, as well as the extent of\\ndocumentation and published literature regarding these\\nconcerns. When looking for practitioners, patients\\nshould evaluate their training and credentials and their\\nreputations in the healing community. Referrals from\\nother patients should be requested. Furthermore, they\\nshould seek practitioners who are knowledgeable and fa-\\nmiliar with a broad spectrum of options of treating can-\\ncer, including those used by conventional medicine, and\\nwho are willing to work in conjunction with convention-\\nal doctors if the patient and treatment requires it. Con-\\nversely, if patients choose a physician who employs and\\nrecommends conventional, allopathic methods, that\\nphysician should be willing to communicate with pa-\\ntients, as well as communicate with an alternate\\nprovider. Another major consideration when choosing a\\npractitioner is whether he or she seems trustworthy, ethi-\\ncal, and compassionate.\\nPatients should also evaluate the particular therapy\\noffered by a practitioner or clinic. They should find out\\nexactly how the therapy works and the principles behind\\nit; whether it is harmless or potentially damaging, and\\nthe positive benefits it offers; what literature and scien-\\ntific studies exist for the therapy; and what other patients\\nsay about the treatment.\\nFinally, patients should evaluate the quality of ser-\\nvice that the practitioner or clinic offers. Cost, reputa-\\ntion, quality of support personnel, and attention to indi-\\nvidual needs are important considerations when evaluat-\\ning the service dimension of a treatment.\\nTypes of alternative treatment\\nAlternative medicine generally views cancer as a\\nholistic problem. That is, cancer represents a problem\\nwith the body’s overall health and immunity. As such,\\ntreatment is holistic as well, striving to strengthen and\\nheal the physical, mental, and spiritual aspects of pa-\\ntients. Alternative cancer treatments may emphasize dif-\\nferent basic approaches, which include traditional medi-\\ncines, psychological approaches, nutritional and dietary\\napproaches, physical approaches, integrated approaches,\\nand experimental programs.\\nTRADITIONAL MEDICINES. Traditional Chinese\\nmedicine uses acupuncture , acupressure massage,\\nherbal remedies, and movement therapies like t’ai chi\\nand qigong to treat cancer. Traditional Chinese herbal\\nremedies have already contributed a significant number\\nof anticancer drugs, as studies have shown their anti-\\ncancer properties and immune stimulants. A 2001 report\\nnoted that the ancient compound artemisinin (worm-\\nwood) appears surprisingly effective in targeting certain\\ncancer cells and helping to destroy them. The therapy is\\nmuch less expensive than many traditional options, but\\nfurther study was underway. Acupuncture has been\\nshown to reduce some tumors and significantly reduce\\npain and improve immune system activity.\\nAyurvedic medicine utilizes detoxification , herbal\\nremedies, massage, exercise, yoga, breathing techniques,\\nand meditation as part of its cancer treatment. Pan-\\nchakarma is an extensive detoxification and strengthen-\\ning program that is recommended for cancer sufferers\\nand those undergoing chemotherapy and radiation. Pan-\\nchakarma uses fasting, special vegetarian diets, enemas,\\nmassage, herbal medicines, and other techniques to rid\\nthe body of excess toxins that are believed to contribute\\nto chronic diseases like cancer, and to strengthen the im-\\nmune system. Ayurvedic herbs are also being demonstrat-\\ned to have significant anticancer properties.\\nNaturopathy and homeopathy are traditional West-\\nern healing systems using herbal medicines and other\\ntechniques to strengthen the immune system and reduce\\nthe pain of cancer treatment. Western herbalism is also\\nbeginning to compile studies of many herbs that have an-\\nticancer and immune strengthening properties.\\nPSYCHOLOGICAL APPROACHES.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 366}, page_content='py, support groups, guided imagery , meditation,\\nbiofeedback, and hypnosis.\\nPsychological approaches work with the idea that\\nthe mind and emotions can profoundly influence the\\nhealth of the body and diseases like cancer. Many studies\\nhave acknowledged that mind and emotions play a key\\nrole in cancer and immune functioning, and psychologi-\\ncal approaches are being used by many conventional\\nprograms, including Harvard Medical School. A new\\nfield of academic medicine called psychoneuroimmunol-\\nogy has begun that studies the interactions between men-\\ntal states and immune response.\\nStudies have shown that patients who approach their\\ncancer with positive attitudes and peaceful acceptance\\nhave higher survival rates than those patients who react\\nwith negative emotions, like depression , cynicism, or\\nhelplessness. Alternative treatments use psychological\\napproaches to help patients overcome the mental and\\nemotional barriers to healing.\\nPHYSICAL APPROACHES. Physical approaches to\\ncancer include exercise; massage therapies; movement\\ntherapies like yoga, t’ai chi and qigong; breathing tech-\\nniques; and relaxation techniques. These therapies strive\\nto increase immune system response, promote relaxation\\nand stress reduction, and reduce side effects of conven-\\ntional treatments such as pain, nausea, weakness, and\\nphysical immobility.\\nNUTRITIONAL AND DIETARY APPROACHES. Diet is\\nnow recognized by scientists to play a major role in re-\\nducing the risk of some cancers. A 1992 report in Oncol-\\nogy claimed that nutritional factors may account for up to\\n70% of avoidable cancer mortality in this country. Many\\nnutritionists also state that cancer patients have height-\\nened needs for diets free of toxic chemicals and full of\\ncancer-fighting nutrients. Diet and nutrition can improve\\nboth a cancer patient’s chances for recovery and quality\\nof life during treatment. In laboratory studies, vitamins\\nsuch as A, C, and E, as well as compounds such as isoth-\\niocyanates and dithiolthiones found in broccoli, cauli-\\nflower, and cabbage, and the antioxidant beta-carotene\\nfound in carrots, have been shown to protect against can-\\ncer. Additionally,bioflavonoids and lycophene found in\\ngreen tea help in the prevention of cancer.\\nDietary approaches for cancer include vegetarian-\\nism, raw food diets, macrobiotics, the Gerson diet, and\\nthe Livingston-Wheeler nutritional program, discussed\\nbelow. Cancer diets generally emphasize fresh fruits,\\nvegetables, whole grains, and legumes, and restrict in-\\ntake of fat, meat, dairy products, sugar, processed foods,\\nand other foods believed to tax cancer patients. Nutri-\\ntional approaches to cancer include antioxidant and vita-\\nmin supplementation and the use of numerous herbal ex-\\ntracts. There are many herbs that have been shown to\\nhave anticancer, immune enhancing, and symptom re-\\nducing properties, and patients are recommended to con-\\nsult competent herbalists for herbal support.\\nINTEGRATED APPROACHES. Keith Block is a con-\\nventional physician and oncologist who is integrating\\nmany alternative practices into his cancer treatment cen-\\nter affiliated with the Chicago Medical School in Illinois.\\nHis program seeks to provide individualized cancer\\ntreatment using conventional therapies while integrating\\nalternative healing techniques. Block advocates a special\\ndiet (based on vegetarianism and macrobiotics), exercise,\\npsychological support, and herbal and nutritional supple-\\nments. Block’s program has received acclaim for both\\ntreatment success and satisfaction of patients.\\nEXPERIMENTAL PROGRAMS. Antineoplaston therapy\\nwas developed by Stanislaw Burzynski, a Polish physi-\\ncian who began practicing in Houston, Texas. Burzynski\\nhas isolated a chemical, deficient in those with cancer,\\nwhich he believes stops cancer growth, and his treatment\\nhas shown some promise.\\nDr. Joseph Gold, the director of the Syracuse Cancer\\nResearch Institute, discovered that the chemical hy-\\ndrazine sulfate has many positive effects in cancer pa-\\ntients, including stopping weight loss, shrinking tumors,\\nand increasing survival rates.\\nThe Livingston therapy was developed by the late\\nDr. Virginia Livingston, an American physician. She as-\\nserted that cancer is caused by certain bacteria that she\\nclaimed are present in all tumors. She advocated a detox-\\nification program and special diet that emphasized raw\\nor lightly cooked and primarily vegetarian foods, with\\nspecial vitamin and nutritional supplements.\\nThe Gerson therapy was for years the best known\\nnutritional therapy for cancer. It is available in two clin-\\nics in California and Mexico. It consists of a basic vege-\\ntarian diet low in salt and fat, with high doses of particu-\\nlar nutrients using raw fruit and vegetable juices. The\\nGerson therapy also requires patients to drink raw calf’s\\nliver juice, believed to aid the liver, and advocates fre-\\nquent coffee enemas, which are claimed to help the body\\nevacuate toxins.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe aim of allopathic (conventional) cancer treatment\\nis to remove all or as much of the tumor as possible and to\\nprevent the recurrence or spread of the primary tumor.\\nWhile devising a conventional treatment plan for cancer,\\nthe likelihood of curing the cancer has to be weighed\\nagainst the side effects of the treatment.

Cancer treatment\\ncan take many different forms, and it is always tailored to\\nthe individual patient. The decision on which type of treat-\\nment is the most appropriate depends on the type and lo-\\ncation of cancer, the extent to which it has already spread,\\nthe patient’s age, sex, general health status, and personal\\ntreatment preferences. The major types of treatment are:\\nsurgery, radiation, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hor-\\nmone therapy, and bone marrow transplantation.\\nSurgery\\nSurgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the\\nmost frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec-\\ntive when a cancer is small and confined to one area of\\nthe body. Surgery can be used for many purposes. Treat-\\nment of cancer by surgery involves removal of the tumor\\nto cure the disease. Along with the cancer, some part of\\nthe normal surrounding tissue may also be removed to\\nensure that no cancer cells remain in the area. Since can-\\ncer usually spreads via the lymphatic system, adjoining\\nlymph nodes may be examined and sometimes removed,\\nas well. Preventive or prophylactic surgery involves re-\\nmoval of an abnormal looking area that is likely to be-\\ncome malignant over time. The most definitive tool for\\ndiagnosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes a biopsy can\\nbe performed by inserting a needle through the skin.\\nHowever, at other times, the only way to obtain tissue\\nsample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone in\\ncases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More often,\\nit is used in conjunction with surgery and chemotherapy.\\nRadiation can be either external or internal. In the external\\nform, the radiation is aimed at the tumor from outside the\\nbody. In internal radiation (also known as brachytherapy),\\na radioactive substance in the form of pellets or liquid is\\nplaced at the cancerous site by means of a pill, injection,\\nor insertion in a sealed container.\\nChemotherapy\\nChemotherapy is the use of drugs to kill cancer\\ncells. It destroys the hard-to-detect cancer cells that have\\nspread and are circulating in the body. Chemotherapeutic\\ndrugs can be taken either orally or intravenously, and\\nmay be given alone or in conjunction with surgery, radia-\\ntion, or both. The toxic effects of chemotherapy are se-\\nvere. In 2003, a new technique was developed to stream-\\nline identification of drug compounds that are toxic to\\ncancerous cells but not to healthy cells. The technique\\nidentified nine drugs, one of which had never before\\nbeen identified for use in cancer treatment. Researchers\\nbegan looking into developing the new drug for possible\\nuse. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant to the\\nside effects of other treatments that follow, such as radia-\\ntion therapy. The more common use of chemotherapy is\\nadjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance the effec-\\ntiveness of other treatments. For example, after surgery,\\nadjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy any cancerous\\ncells that still remain in the body.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s own immune sys-\\ntem to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment is\\nbeing intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yet\\nwidely available to most cancer patients. The various im-\\nmunological agents being tested include substances pro-\\nduced by the body (such as the interferons, interleukins,\\nand growth factors), monoclonal antibodies, and vac-\\ncines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do not\\nprevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treat people\\nwho already have the disease. Cancer vaccines work by\\nboosting the body’s immune system and training the im-\\nmune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells.\\nHormone therapy\\nHormone therapy is standard treatment for some\\ntypes of cancers that are hormone-dependent and grow\\nfaster in the presence of particular hormones. These in-\\nclude cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hormone\\ntherapy involves blocking the production or action of\\nthese hormones. As a result, the growth of the tumor\\nslows down and survival may be extended for several\\nmonths or years. However, in 2003, the Women’s Health\\nInitiative found that even relatively short-term use of es-\\ntrogen plus progestin is associated with increased risk of\\nbreast cancer, diagnosis at a more advanced stage of the\\ndisease, and a higher number of abnormal mammo-\\ngrams. The longer a woman used HRT, the more her risk\\nincreased. This contradicted earlier beliefs that HRT\\ncould prevent breast cancer. So checking with a physi-\\ncian for the latest information is advised.\\nBone marrow transplantation\\nThe bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi-\\nties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bone mar-\\nrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supply and is\\nessential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs or radi-\\nation needed to destroy cancer cells also unfortunately\\ndestroys bone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with\\nhealthy cells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone mar-\\nrow transplant is the removal of marrow from one person\\nand the transplant of the blood-forming cells either to the\\nsame person or to someone else. Bone marrow transplan-\\ntation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to res-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 351\\nCancer\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 351'),\n",

By raising tu-\\nmors to high fever temperatures, the performance of cer-\\ntain cancer drugs was noted. Hyperthermia is thought to\\ndestroy cancer cells much the same way that the body\\nuses fever to naturally combat other forms of disease.\\nMany different specialists generally work together\\nas a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is a\\nphysician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologist\\nprovides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any other\\nnon-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation.\\nThe oncologist often serves as the primary physician and\\ncoordinates the patient’s treatment plan. There are many\\nother specialists involved in cancer treatment, and virtu-\\nally any type of medical or surgical specialist may be-\\ncome involved with care of the cancer patient, should it\\nbecome necessary.\\nExpected results\\nLifetime risk is the term that cancer researchers use to\\nrefer to the probability that an individual, over the course\\nof a lifetime, will develop cancer or die from it. In the\\nUnited States, men have a one in two lifetime risk of de-\\nveloping cancer, and for women the risk is one in three.\\nOverall, African Americans are more likely to develop\\ncancer than Caucasians. African Americans are also 30%\\nmore likely to die of cancer than Caucasians. Many can-\\ncers are curable if detected and treated at their early\\nstages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affected by many\\nfactors, particularly the type of cancer the patient has, the\\nstage of the cancer, the extent to which it has metasta-\\nsized, and the aggressiveness of the cancer. In addition,\\nthe patient’s age, general health status, and the effective-\\nness of the treatment being pursued are also important fac-\\ntors. To help predict the future course and outcome of the\\ndisease and the likelihood of recovery from the disease,\\ndoctors often use statistics. The five-year survival rates are\\nthe most common measures used. The number refers to\\nthe proportion of people with cancer who are expected to\\nbe alive five years after initial diagnosis, compared with a\\nsimilar population that is free of cancer. It is important to\\nnote that while statistics can give some information about\\nthe average survival experience of cancer patients in a\\ngiven population, they cannot be used to indicate individ-\\nual prognosis, because no two patients or cancers are ex-\\nactly alike. The unpredictability of cancer can be seen as\\npositive, as well as negative—some patients have experi-\\nenced recoveries in cases that were deemed incurable.\\nAlternative medicine rarely claims to be able to cure\\ncancer on a regular basis, but many treatments seem to\\nhelp with controlling symptoms, controlling the pain and\\nside effects of conventional treatments, and increasing the\\nquality of life for cancer sufferers. Alternative therapies\\nhave also shown unexpected results and cures. Alternative\\ntherapies may be strongest as preventative measures, be-\\nfore major problems like cancer occur in the body.\\nPrevention\\nMost practitioners agree that the best treatment for\\ncancer is prevention. Having sound physical and mental\\nhealth can significantly reduce the chances of getting\\ncancer. The following guidelines are generally recom-\\nmended by doctors, nutritionists, and alternative practi-\\ntioners for cancer prevention and recovery:\\n• Refraining from smoking.\\n• Not drinking alcohol excessively.\\n• Exercising regularly, at least 20 minutes per day,\\npreferably outdoors in the fresh air.\\n• Avoiding exposure to radiation. This includes avoiding\\nunnecessary x rays, not residing near sources of natural\\nor human-made radiation, and avoiding occupational\\nexposure to radiation.\\n• Avoiding exposure to harmful chemicals in food, the\\nhome, and workplace.\\n• Maintaining proper body weight, particularly avoiding\\nobesity.\\n• Practicing safe sex.\\n• Protecting the skin from overexposure to sunlight.\\nAvoiding the midday sun between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M.\\nand never allowing the skin to become sunburned help\\nwith prevention.\\n• Eating a healthy diet. Becoming educated on and prac-\\nticing dietary principles reduces the risk of cancer.\\nThese principles include eating plenty of fresh fruits,\\nvegetables, beans, and whole grains and consuming or-\\nganically grown foods when possible. Minimizing\\novereating and reducing intake of meat and dairy prod-\\nucts while increasing fiber are recommended. Avoiding\\nprocessed and canned foods, including soft drinks, and\\navoiding sugar and refined starch products like white\\nflour also helps. Reducing the intake of fat, avoiding\\nhydrogenated vegetable oils like margarine and short-\\nening, and drinking filtered or spring water have been\\nrecommended.\\n• Striving to maintain sound mental and emotional health\\nis believed to help prevent cancer. Learning a technique\\nlike yoga, t’ai chi, meditation, or others can reduce\\nstress and promote relaxation. Maintaining healthy rela-\\ntionships and social support systems also relieves stress.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2352\\nCancer\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 352'),\n",

Modern biological cancer therapies began to ap-\\npear at the beginning of the twentieth century.\\nDr. Max Gerson’s therapy is probably foremost\\namong the early ones, although he had some equally em-\\ninent contemporaries. However, there are now many al-\\nternative health practitioners specializing in the treat-\\nment of cancer to be considered, although success varies.\\nBenefits\\nBiological cancer treatments are non-invasive and\\ndo not have the drawbacks associated with chemothera-\\npy and radiation therapy. Unlike biological treatments,\\nboth deplete or completely destroy the body’s immune\\nsystem and can leave patients in a very weakened state.\\nBiological treatments work by actually strengthen-\\ning the immune system so that it can overcome any ab-\\nnormal situation. A successful biological cancer treat-\\nment will leave patients feeling better than they did be-\\nfore they became ill, with all bodily functions effectively\\nharmonized and energy levels raised.\\nDescription\\nAll biological cancer therapies focus on strengthen-\\ning the human organism so that it can kill the cancer,\\nrather than focusing on the cancer alone, as is the case\\nwith allopathic medicine. Therefore, all these therapies\\nhave in common that healthy lifestyle must be practiced.\\nIn particular, this means abstaining from processed, de-\\nnatured foods, and ensuring the absence of pollution and\\ntoxins from diet and living environment.\\nNatural hygiene and other alternative therapies pre-\\nscribe fresh fruit and vegetables in abundance. The Ger-\\nson therapy uses fresh juices from organic sources. Es-\\npecially in the beginning a vital aspect of the treatment is\\ndetoxification. This is the process of encouraging, and\\nsometimes forcing, the body to eliminate toxins stored in\\nthe body cells and gastrointestinal tract. In the case of\\ncancer patients, this can involve a considerable quantity\\nof toxic waste that must be flushed out of the system.\\nConcurrently with the detoxification process the\\ntreatment will aim to provide the organism with plentiful\\nsupplies of fresh enzymes and nutrients that will allow\\nthe body to rebuild itself, and renew systems such as the\\nendocrine system and immune system.\\nWhen treating most disorders and diseases with nat-\\nural therapies, the patient is encouraged to undertake a\\nprogram of exercise to enhance the effectiveness of the\\ntreatment. This is not so in the case of cancer patients,\\nhowever, as generally they may not be strong enough for\\nsuch activities, and as their bodies will need every ounce\\nof strength to fight the cancer. Instead, they are advised to\\nundertake an exercise program once they are well enough.\\nPractitioners\\nAll the practitioners who have been successful with\\nthe treatment of serious disease, particularly cancer, have\\na reputation for being very tough on their patients, in fact\\nsome have been described as Hitler-like in their attitudes.\\nWhen questioned, many say that unless a cancer patient\\nis prepared to tackle the problem of detoxification seri-\\nously and follow the diet without diversification, then\\nthere is little hope that they will be able to overcome the\\ndisease. Often patients who are in a weakened state of\\nhealth need the support of a therapist who is prepared to\\nbe firm with them.\\nDR. MAX GERSON (?–1959). Dr. Gerson’s therapy\\nprobably can be considered the original biological can-\\ncer treatment. In his book entitled A Cancer Therapy,\\nResults of Fifty Cases , Gerson documented 50 success-\\nfully treated cancer patients. He explained to readers that\\nthe cases in his book were the most extensively docu-\\nmented and therefore most suitable for the purposes of\\ndemonstrating his cure.\\nThis therapy relies mainly on fresh organic juices,\\nbut includes supplements and strict instructions for\\nlifestyle. A vital aspect of his treatment are the coffee en-\\nemas he devised to achieve thorough detoxification.\\nDR. LINUS PAULING (1901–1994). Nobel Prize laure-\\nate, Dr. Linus Pauling, researched the properties of nutri-\\ntional supplements in treating disease for many years,\\nand he is generally accepted as the foremost authority on\\nthe subject. In 1979, he published a work with co-author\\nEwan Cameron titled Cancer and Vitamin C. Pauling ad-\\nvocated supplements, in particular megadoses of vita-\\nmin C, for the treatment of cancer and other degenera-\\ntive diseases.\\nDR. ANN WIGMORE (1909–1993). Wheatgrass juice\\nand sprouts are the basis for Wigmore’s regimen, which\\nshe originally devised to cure her own chronic diseases\\nincluding cancer, and has been successfully helping peo-\\nple for decades. The Wigmore diet focuses primarily on\\nlive foods. Wigmore felt that raw vegetables held more\\nnutritionthan when cooked and were without the chem-\\nical additives that processed foods hold. Her therapy is\\nstill practiced at the Hippocrates Institute and has been\\nadopted by a number of alternative health care practi-\\ntioners as the basis for their treatment.\\nDR. RANDOLPH STONE (1890–1981). Stone devel-\\noped a system known as Polarity therapy during his ca-\\nreer, which spanned 60 years. He felt that health should\\nbe measured by an assessment of the human energy\\nfield. This is affected by daily life, nutrition, exercise,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2354\\nCancer treatments, biological\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 354'),\n",

This will balance health, and\\nso produce satisfactory energy fields.\\nDR. MICHIO KUSHI. Microbiotics is the belief that\\npeople are influenced by everything around them, in-\\ncluding the environment, foods they eat, and even where\\nthey live. Promoting a positive lifestyle is also encour-\\naged in order to keep a good outlook and mental attitude.\\nPossibly the most famous teacher of macrobiotics in the\\nUnited States, Michio Kushi, in collaboration with Alex\\nJack, wrote The Cancer Prevention Diet in 1993. It is a\\ncomprehensive guide to the prevention and treatment of\\ncancer with a macrobiotic diet.\\nTherapies\\nBOTANICAL MEDICINE. There are several different\\ntherapies that fit into this category, which encompasses\\ngeneral herbal medicine, Chinese herbalism and several\\nother ethnic herbal disciplines.\\nNATURAL HYGIENE. Natural hygiene practitioners\\nhave a long history of successfully treating such serious\\ndiseases as cancer. This diet is a vegetarian diet focused\\naround maintaining a healthy and happy out look. Rest,\\nfresh air, grains, fruits, and vegetables are encouraged.\\nThe American Natural Hygiene Society is a good source\\nof information regarding treatment and practitioners.\\nAYURVEDIC MEDICINE. This centuries old system of\\nnatural medicine originated in India. Arvada has a con-\\ncept of life force, which is similar to the Chinese chi. It\\naims to purge the body of undesirable matter, and then\\nrebuild it with good nutrition, while at the same time at-\\ntending to all aspects of the patient’s life both physical\\nand spiritual. This system is recognized by the World\\nHealth Organization.\\nMACROBIOTICS. A diet of largely whole grains and\\nvegetables, combined with a unique philosophy is the\\nessence of the macrobiotic diet. Classes are available\\nlasting a weekend, one week, or one month, costing\\n$350, $1,250, and $2,900 respectively.\\nIn general, the charge for various clinics and practi-\\ntioners varies widely, so it is essential for the patient to\\ndiscuss fees with the practitioner before treatment.\\nPreparations\\nWithout exception, the above practitioners advocat-\\ned the use of fresh natural produce, preferably organic,\\nfor cancer patients and anyone else who wishes to im-\\nprove their health. Where herbal remedies or other sup-\\nplements are prescribed, it is important to ensure that the\\noriginal formula is purchased, and not just a copy. Un-\\nscrupulous individuals have been known to pass off\\nunauthentic remedies using the names of well-known\\npractitioners.\\nPrecautions\\nNone of the therapies will be effective if the regimen\\nis not followed in its entirety. No matter how good the\\nquality of organic produce, no benefits will be felt if the\\npatient is still being exposed to environmental pollution,\\nor if detoxification procedures are inadequate. It is for\\nthis reason that most practitioners recommend that a cure\\nbe taken in the setting of a clinic, because all of these de-\\ntails can then become the responsibility of the staff, free-\\ning the patient to concentrate on the business of becom-\\ning well.\\nIn fact many practitioners who treat cancer take\\ntheir cure so seriously, that they will refuse to treat pa-\\ntients who are not prepared to take all the necessary steps\\nand truly commit themselves to becoming well. They\\nwarn that natural cures for cancer are not easy, cancer is\\na sign that the integrity of the body system has been seri-\\nously compromised, and nothing but the strictest regi-\\nmen is likely to facilitate a return to health. Even so,\\nthese therapies are very experimental and there are no\\nguarantees of a cure.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects associated with natural therapies are\\nvery mild compared to those commonly experienced\\nwith allopathic treatments. Cost is one of the main in-\\nhibitors of these treatments.\\nHowever, in the case of cancer treatment, a healing\\ncrisis can be an unpleasant experience. Alternative medi-\\ncine practitioners believe that all illness is a result of a\\ntoxic condition in the body, and cancer, being one of the\\nmost serious conditions, is an indication of more serious\\nlevels of toxicity. This means that when the body starts\\nto throw off these toxins, the blood system becomes\\noverloaded and the patient will experience headaches,\\nfevers,nausea, and in some cases extreme sensitivity to\\nstimuli such as sound and light. It is highly advisable to\\nseek a practitioner to help with detoxification therefore.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nTreatments for cancer are one of the areas where allo-\\npathic medicine disapproves most strongly of alternative\\nmedicine, and consequently these natural treatments are\\nthe subject of much adverse publicity.

They are painful and often recur from once\\nevery few years to almost continually. Canker sores are\\nknown medically as apthous ulcers or apthous stomatitis.\\nDescription\\nCanker sores occur on the inside of the mouth, usu-\\nally on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and/or soft palate.\\nThey can also occur on the tongue and in the throat.\\nOften, several canker sores will appear at the same time\\nand may be grouped in clusters. They are painful and\\nsensitive to touch. The average canker sore is about one-\\nquarter inch in size, although they can occasionally be\\nlarger. The sores may last for weeks at a time and leave a\\nscar. The initial symptom is a tingling or mildly painful\\nitchingsensation in the area where the sore will appear.\\nAfter one to several days, a small red swelling appears,\\nwhich eventually becomes a grayish ulcer with a red ring\\nof inflammation surrounding the sore. Canker sores can\\nbe very painful, especially if they are touched repeatedly\\n(e.g., by the tongue). They last for one to three weeks.\\nApproximately 20% of the United States population\\nis affected with recurring canker sores, and more women\\nthan men get them. Women are more likely to have\\ncanker sores during their premenstrual time.\\nCanker sores may be confused with cold sores\\ncaused by the herpes simplex virus because the appear-\\nance of both is similar. However, herpes infections occur\\nmost commonly on the outside of the lips, on the hard\\npalate, and on the gums, whereas canker sores usually\\noccur on the soft tissues inside the mouth. Unlike canker\\nsores, herpes cold sores are infectious.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe exact cause of canker sores is unknown. There\\nseems to be at least some link to immune reactions.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2356\\nCanker sores\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDenatured—Food which has been processed and\\nis no longer of benefit to the body.\\nDetoxification—The process of cleansing the sys-\\ntem of accumulated toxins.\\nOncologist—Cancer specialist.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 356'),\n",

(Photograph by Edward H. Gill,\\nCustom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permission.)\\nThere may also be a genetic tendency to develop canker\\nsores. Accidental injuries to the mouth from vigorous\\ntoothbrush scrapes, poorly fitted dentures, braces, or\\nself-inflicted bites may give rise to canker sores. They\\ncan also be triggered by stress, dietary deficiencies, hor-\\nmonal changes, and food allergies . Sodium lauryl sul-\\nfate, which is an ingredient in many toothpastes, may\\ncontribute to the development of canker sores by strip-\\nping the mucous coating inside the mouth.\\nDiagnosis\\nCanker sores are diagnosed by observation of the\\nsore. A distinction between canker sores and cold sores\\nshould be made because the latter is infectious. Other dis-\\norders of the mouth may need to be ruled out as well; a\\nskin lesion biopsy may be required for further diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nMany alternative therapies for canker sores try to\\nheal the existing sores and prevent their recurrence. Sev-\\neral herbal remedies may be helpful in the treatment of\\nexisting sores. These include:\\n• calendula (Calendula officinalis)\\n• chamomile (Matricaria recutita)\\n• goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis)\\n• licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra)\\n• myrrh (Commiphora molmol)\\n• peppermint (Mentha peperita)\\n• slippery elm (Ulmus fulva)\\nThe herbs can be made into a strong tea. Compresses\\nsoaked in the tea can be applied directly to the mouth, or\\nthe tea can be swished in the mouth for several minutes.\\nThe deglycyrrhizinated (DGL) form of licorice root,\\nGlycyrrhiza glabra, is soothing to the mucous mem-\\nbranes of the mouth and can shorten the healing time for\\ncanker sores. The powdered DGL should be mixed with\\nwarm water to make a thin paste that can be used twice\\ndaily. It should be swirled in the mouth for several min-\\nutes and then spit out.\\nB-complex vitamins, folic acid, and iron (taken sep-\\narately or combined in a multivitamin) can help prevent\\nrecurrent outbreaks, since canker sores are often associ-\\nated with deficiencies in these nutrients.\\nCanker sores often occur during stressful times. Re-\\nlaxation techniques such as meditation , guided im-\\nagery, and acupressure may help prevent or lessen the\\nseverity of outbreaks.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nSince canker sores heal themselves in most cases,\\ntreatment usually isn’t necessary. Topical anesthetics,\\nsuch as lidocaine and similar remedies, may be used for\\npainrelief. Corticosteroid ointments may be used to re-\\nduce inflammation and speed healing. A protective paste,\\nlike Orabase, can be used to prevent irritation of the\\nsores by teeth, dental appliances, or fluid intake.\\nSevere cases may be treated with the antibiotic\\ntetracycline. This is not recommended for children,\\nhowever, because it may permanently discolor any teeth\\nthat are still forming. Chemical or physical cautery or\\nlow-powered laser treatments may also be used to de-\\ncrease severe pain. Ulcers tend not to recur where a\\nlaser has been used.\\nExpected results\\nCanker sores tend to heal spontaneously. The pain\\nusually decreases within a few days, and other symptoms\\nresolve in one or two weeks. If symptoms last longer, if\\nthere are increasing numbers of outbreaks, or if the pain\\nis severe, a doctor should be consulted.\\nPrevention\\nGood oral hygiene is necessary to prevent recurrent\\noutbreaks as well as secondary bacterial infections dur-\\ning an outbreak. This includes regular brushing, floss-\\ning, and regular trips to the dentist. Dentures, braces,\\nand fillings should be rechecked and possibly refitted.\\nToothpastes containing sodium lauryl sulfate should\\nnot be used.\\nIdentifying food allergens and making dietary\\nchanges may help prevent outbreaks. Spicy foods should\\nalso be avoided because they may serve as irritants.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 357'),\n",

This beetle lives on honeysuckle and olive\\ntrees in western Asia and southern Europe. It is bright green\\nand about 0.5 in (1.3 cm) in length. Other names for cantharis\\ninclude:Cantharis vesicator, N.O. Insecta, and coleoptera.\\nThe Spanish fly produces a toxic substance called\\ncantharidin. Cantharidin is a strong poison that primarily\\naffects the urinary tract and causes burning pain and\\nvomiting . Cantharidian is caustic and causes skin blis-\\ntering. Since homeopathy is based on the Law of Simi-\\nlars, a doctrine that says to treat a symptom with a dilut-\\ned remedy that produces the same symptom is stronger\\namounts, this homeopathic remedy is used for illnesses\\nthat have burning pain as a symptom. Because cantharis\\nis a member of the animal kingdom, its activity excites\\nthe passions of animals. As such, cantharis is indicated\\nfor anger that is very severe with fits of rage. Likewise,\\ncantharis is indicated for conditions of the body that are\\nextreme, ie. pain that is stabbing, burning, and sharp.\\nGeneral use\\nHomeopathic remedies are chosen based upon the\\nspecific set of symptoms and traits displayed by each pa-\\ntient. In general, cantharis is used to treat conditions\\ncharacterized by burning pain and strong thirst but no\\nurge to drink. Conditions for which cantharis is indicated\\nwill typically worsen rapidly.\\nCantharis is primarily used to treat cystitis, which is\\ninflammation of the urinary bladder because of infection\\nor irritation. It is also used to treat burns and blisters .\\nSpanish fly was traditionally used as an aphrodisiac (in-\\ncreases sexual desire). It was also used to remove warts,\\ntreat baldness, increase loss of fluids (acting as a diuret-\\nic), and for rheumatic problems (inflammation and de-\\ngeneration of the joints).\\nMental symptoms treated with cantharis\\nHomeopathy treats a person’s whole being, mental\\nand physical. The patient who needs cantharis can be\\nconfused and have odd ideas, may be maniacal and\\ndemonstrate raging fury or sexual frenzy, or may loose\\nconsciousness. The cantharis patient may be restless and\\nexcitable. He or she may be extremely thirsty but have\\ndifficulty swallowing. Also, the patient may have no ap-\\npetite and a strong avoidance of food. Other mental\\nproblems that can be treated with cantharis include: ex-\\ncessive desire for sex (nymphomania), severe anxiety ,\\nscreaming, querulousness (constant complaining), and\\ninsolence (being overbearing).\\nPhysical symptoms treated with cantharis\\nThe intense urge to urinate and burning pain are key\\nsymptoms for cantharis. Cantharis is indicated for the\\npatient who experiences rapid and intense inflammation\\nof the urinary system. There is lower abdominal and\\nlower back pain. The severe burning pain associated with\\nthe urinary tract makes the patient afraid to urinate.\\nThere is a frequent and urgent need to urinate, however,\\nonly small amounts (drops) of urine are passed. The\\nurine may contain blood. The patient may experience hy-\\ndrophobia (fear of water) and, although extremely\\nthirsty, cannot drink water or even tolerate seeing or\\nhearing water. A severe, stabbing headache may be pre-\\nsent and the patient may avoid bright light.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2358\\nCantharis\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nInflammation —A localized reaction to tissue in-\\njury or damage, usually characterized by pain,\\nswelling, and redness.\\nSkin lesion biopsy—A procedure in which a sliver\\nof tissue from the skin is removed in order to ex-\\namine it and establish a diagnosis.\\nUlcer—A site of damage to the skin or mucous\\nmembranes characterized by the formation of pus\\nand the death of tissue.

In this context, essential\\nmeans it must be obtained in the diet. Nonessential types\\nof amino acids can be synthesized to some extent within\\nthe body. The kidney is able to form carnitine from the\\namino acids lysine and methionine , in addition to iron\\nand vitamins B6, niacin, and C. The function of carnitine\\nis to mobilize long-chain fatty acids into the powerhouse\\nof the cell, where they are used for energy. Carnitine is\\nnecessary for infants to grow and develop normally.\\nGeneral use\\nThe strongest indication for supplemental carnitine\\nis a genetic defect that causes a deficiency. It may also\\nbe inadequately manufactured by babies, particularly\\nthose who are premature or have a low birth weight.\\nAbnormally low levels of carnitine are most com-\\nmonly associated with a few rare genetic diseases.\\nSymptoms of inadequate carnitine can include confu-\\nsion, heart pain, muscle weakness, and obesity . Poor\\nconsumption of the nutrients required in order to synthe-\\nsize carnitine also sometimes results in deficiency. These\\nnutrients include lysine, methionine, vitamin C , iron,\\nniacin, and vitamin B6 (pyridoxine). Anyone with a pro-\\ntein deficient diet may have inadequate levels of the\\nbuilding blocks for carnitine. Lysine and methionine are\\nlikely to be lacking in a strict vegan diet, although some\\nfortified grains are available. Those who are under severe\\nor chronic health stress are also at higher risk. People\\nwho have had surgery, severe burns, or wasting illnesses\\nrequire higher protein levels, and might benefit from a\\nsupplement. The use of supplements containing D-carni-\\ntine has the potential to cause L-carnitine deficiency.\\nThe heart is the most carnitine-rich organ in the\\nbody, and there are several heart or circulatory condi-\\ntions that may benefit from more carnitine than is nor-\\nmally in the diet. Carnitine appears to help the heart, a\\nmuscle that requires a lot of energy, function better. One\\nof the primary heart problems that can be helped by car-\\nnitine supplementation is angina (heart pain due to de-\\ncreased oxygen because of coronary artery disease). Two\\nstudies using L-carnitine, and one using L-propionyl-\\ncarnitine, have demonstrated a reduction in symptoms of\\nthis condition. When carnitine is added to the treatment\\nplan, it can potentially reduce some of the other medica-\\ntions used to control angina. However, reducing medica-\\ntion for angina patients should be supervised and guided\\nby a healthcare provider.\\nIntermittent claudication is a condition that develops\\nin some people with severe atherosclerosis. Walking be-\\ncomes painful as a result of decreased blood flow to the\\nlegs. Most studies have shown significant improvement\\nin the distance walked without pain when a supplement\\nof L-propionyl-carnitine was used. The dose used in one\\nstudy was 0.07 oz (2 g) per day.\\nWhen used along with traditionally prescribed med-\\nications, carnitine may improve survival rates after a\\nheart attack. Other benefits, including lowering the\\nheart rate, blood pressure, and lipid levels occurred in\\ntreated groups. The dose and type used in one study was\\n0.14 oz (4 g) per day of L-carnitine.\\nMost studies of carnitine used to improve athletic\\nperformance have not shown any benefit. Supplementa-\\ntion may have some minimal effects on Alzheimer’s pa-\\ntients; some study groups had slightly slower rates of de-\\nterioration. These results remain questionable and fur-\\nther study is needed.\\nThere is some evidence that the use of supplemental\\nL-carnitine, at a dose of approximately 500-1000 mg\\nthree times per day, may help to lower levels of serum\\ncholesterol. However, this regimen would be expensive,\\nand there are other effective and less expensive supple-\\nments available. These include garlic, red yeast rice,\\nniacin, high fiber diets, and soy proteins.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2360\\nCarnitine\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 360'),\n",

Carnitine may prove helpful in alleviating the\\nsymptoms of CFS, perhaps by increasing the efficiency\\nof energy production. One small study used a dose of 0.1\\noz (3 g) of L-carnitine per day.\\nUndocumented claims for the health benefits of car-\\nnitine include treatment of Down’s syndrome, muscular\\ndystrophy, some forms of male infertility , chronic ob-\\nstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and alcoholic fatty\\nliver disease. Carnitine has also been said to reduce the\\ntoxicity of AZT, a medication for AIDS.\\nPreparations\\nCarnitine is found primarily in meats, but may also\\nbe found in avocados, breast milk, dairy products, and\\ntempeh. In the body, it can be synthesized in the kidney\\nfrom lysine and methionine. Supplements are available\\nin capsules, but are generally quite expensive.\\nSeveral forms of oral carnitine are available, includ-\\ning L-carnitine, D-carnitine, and DL-carnitine. The latter\\ntwo forms are often found in over-the-counter nutritional\\nproducts and supplements. They are associated with more\\nadverse effects. Products containing D-carnitine and DL-\\ncarnitine should be avoided. L-acetyl-carnitine and L-\\npropionyl-carnitine are acceptable alternative formula-\\ntions that may be recommended for specific conditions.\\nPrecautions\\nWomen who are pregnant or may become pregnant\\nshould not take carnitine supplements. Breastfeeding\\nmothers should also avoid them, since they may not be\\nsafe for infants in this situation. Babies requiring a supple-\\nment due to low birth weight or pre-term conditions\\nshould have it prescribed and monitored by a healthcare\\nprovider. Those with food allergies to proteins are at risk\\nof adverse reactions to carnitine. People who have chronic\\nliver disease are at risk of having high carnitine levels due\\nto their illness and should not take carnitine supplements.\\nSide effects\\nL-carnitine taken by mouth has been known to cause\\ngastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting,\\ncramps, and diarrhea.

Plants appear to pro-\\nduce carotenoids to protect their stems and leaves from\\nthe energy of the sun. Ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths can\\ngenerate molecules called free radicals that can damage\\nliving cells. Free radicals are molecules, or fragments of\\nmolecules, that are unstable and highly reactive. Free rad-\\nicals are produced as the result of a normal molecule los-\\ning or gaining an electron. In normal, stable molecules,\\nelectrons associate in pairs. However, radiation from the\\nsun can result in the removal of an electron from a mole-\\ncule and the formation of free radical. Carotenoids as an-\\ntioxidants limit free radical damage by donating electrons\\nto quench, or neutralize, the oxidant radicals.\\nIn human nutrition , carotenoids, as antioxidants,\\nserve to protect cells from the danger of free radicals that\\nmay be produced by the body during metabolism or by\\ncigarette smoke, sunlight, radiation, pollutants, or even\\nstress. Tens of thousands of free radicals are created in\\nthe body every second. When a free radical captures an\\nelectron from another molecule, a new free radical is cre-\\nated as the second molecule has a lone, unpaired electron.\\nThis new free radical seeks to capture another electron\\nand become normal again. This continual process of\\nforming free radicals becomes a chain reaction. Unless\\nquenched, these free radicals can damage DNA, fats, and\\nproteins. However, the body has a defense against these\\nfree radicals. With proper nourishment, the body can\\nmake sufficient quantities of antioxidant enzymes and\\nsubstrates for those enzymes that can facilitate the\\nquenching of free radical reactions by antioxidants. These\\nenzymes include superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glu-\\ntathione peroxidase. In addition to these enzymes pro-\\nduced by the body, antioxidant nutrients taken into the\\nbody through foods or through dietary supplements also\\ncan surrender electrons to the free radicals without\\nadding to the chain reaction, thus terminating the free\\nradical reactions. Antioxidant nutrients include vitamins\\nA, C, and E,bioflavonoids, lipoic acid, and carotenoids.\\nDespite the large number of carotenoids in nature,\\nonly about 50 are present in foods that people in the\\nUnited States eat, and only about 14 of those have been\\nidentified in blood, an indication of what is absorbed in\\nthe human body. All carotenoids are fat-soluble com-\\npounds, meaning that they can dissolve in fats and oils,\\nbut not in water. The carotenoid family consists of\\nsmaller families of pigments called carotenes and xan-\\nthophylls. Carotenes are hydrocarbons, containing only\\ncarbon and hydrogen atoms, while xanthophylls also\\ncontain oxygen. The carotenes have been studied more\\nthan the other carotenoids. The ones of most interest in\\nhuman nutrition are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and\\nlycopene. Important xanthophylls include lutein, astax-\\nanthin, zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin.\\nAs acceptance of the many health benefits of\\ncarotenoids increases and continues to be proven, the ad-\\ndition of five individual carotenoids (alpha-carotene,\\nbeta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and beta-cryptoxanthin)\\nwere added to the National Cancer Institute’s Diet Histo-\\nry Questionnaire. The carotenoids appear to have many\\nhealth benefits, but more research is required to confirm\\nmany of the health effects seen so far and to identify ad-\\nditional benefits.\\nAs one of the most common carotenoids, beta-\\ncarotene is the most well-known and well-studied\\ncarotenoid. It is found in carrots, pumpkins, peaches, and\\nsweet potatoes. Beta-carotene is the primary precursor to\\nvitamin A. With the aid of dioxygenase enzymes, the\\nhuman body can split one molecule of beta-carotene into\\ntwo vitamin A molecules. Vitamin A has many vital\\nfunctions in the human body, including being involved\\nin: (1) the growth and repair of body tissues, (2) the for-\\nmation of bones and teeth, (3) the resistance of the body\\nto infection, and (4) the development of healthy eye tis-\\nsues. Vitamin A deficiency symptoms include night\\nblindness , dry eyes, dry, rough skin, impaired bone\\ngrowth, and susceptibility to respiratory infections. Vita-\\nmin A, is a fat soluble vitamin, can be stored in the body\\nlong-term and can reach toxic levels over time if\\namounts above recommended levels (10,000 IU for\\nadults and only 6,000 IU for pregnant women) are in-\\ngested. Too much vitamin A can cause headaches, vision\\nproblems,nausea, vomiting, an enlarged liver or spleen,\\nbirth defects, and even death at very high levels. Beta-\\ncarotene is a better source of vitamin A than vitamin A\\nsupplements because it is only converted to vitamin A on\\nan as-needed basis; excess beta-carotene is stored in the\\nbody and unlike vitamin A, is not toxic when taken in\\namounts in excess of body needs. Beta-carotene also im-\\nproves immune function, increases lung capacity, re-\\nduces DNA damage, may provide protection from the\\nsun, and may lessen the risks of some types of cancer.\\nHowever, for people who drink and smoke excessively,\\nbeta-carotene may increase their risk of lung cancer.\\nAlpha-carotene, another common carotenoid, is nor-\\nmally found in the same foods as beta-carotene. It is sim-\\nilar to beta-carotene in structure, with one of the ring\\nstructures being beta-ionone. However, the other ring is\\ndifferent, so one molecule of alpha-carotene yields only\\none molecule of vitamin A. Alpha-carotene has been\\nfound to have powerful anticancer properties in cell-cul-\\nture studies.\\nLycopene is often the most common carotenoid in\\nthe American diet because it is found in tomato products,\\nincluding pizza and spaghetti sauce. It is also present in\\nlesser amounts in watermelon, pink grapefruit, guava,\\nand apricots. Lycopene does not produce vitamin A.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2362\\nCarotenoids\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 362'),\n",

In late 2001, the first clinical\\ntrial showed that lycopene supplementation could even\\nslow progression of prostate cancer growths.\\nCooked tomato sauces were to found to be associat-\\ned with greater health benefits, compared to uncooked\\ntomatoes, because the lycopene in the cooked tomatoes\\nwas more easily absorbed. Also, since lycopene is fat-\\nsoluble, absorption increased when it was mixed with oil\\nin the sauces. Uncooked tomatoes also demonstrated\\nhealth benefits, though to a lesser degree, especially\\nwhen they were used in a salad with a oil-based dressing\\nor in a sandwich with fat-containing meat. Lycopene\\nmay help in the prevention of other cancers as well as\\nprotect against heart attacks.

Both are components of the macula of the eye, a\\nsmall area in the center of the retina responsible for de-\\ntailed vision. These carotenoids may prevent and slow\\nmacular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in\\nthe elderly. As antioxidants, they reduce the amount of\\nfree radical damage to the macula. Lutein may also help\\nprevent the formation of cataracts , reduce the risk of\\nheart disease, and protect against breast cancer.\\nAstaxanthin is a minor carotenoid that serves as a\\npigment in aquatic animals such salmon, trout, and\\nAntarctic krill (small shrimp-like crustaceans that feed\\non algae and that serve as a food source for other sea ani-\\nmals such as whales). Astaxanthin is a strong antioxidant\\nthat appears to enhance the immune system and protect\\nagainst cancer. It also may protect against UV A light, a\\nwavelength of ultraviolet light that can cause sunburn\\nand skin cancer.\\nCryptoxanthin is a minor carotenoid found in peach-\\nes, papayas, tangerines, and oranges. Cryptoxanthin is\\nsecond to beta-carotene in the amount of dietary carotene\\nconverted to vitamin A. Along with other carotenoids, it\\nforms an antioxidant barrier in the human skin. It also ap-\\npears to protect women from cervical cancer.\\nThere are many other minor dietary carotenoids that\\nmost likely provide significant health benefits. A diet\\nthat includes many types of fruits and vegetables is im-\\nportant for supplying those nutrients and their associated\\nhealth benefits.\\nGeneral use\\nAlthough not classified as essential nutrients,\\ncarotenoids are important substances in human food\\nsources, especially in fruits, vegetables, and plant greens,\\nthat provide many health benefits. In addition, some are\\nprecursors to vitamin A. They are primarily consumed\\nthrough the diet; however the more common carotenoids\\nare available as dietary supplements.\\nPreparations\\nBeta-carotene, lutein, and lycopene are sold as indi-\\nvidual carotenoid supplements. Beta-carotene is avail-\\nable in two forms, natural and synthetic. The natural\\nform is preferred to the synthetic, as the natural form ap-\\npears to be a stronger antioxidant. Algae are an abundant\\nsource of beta-carotene and are used to produce supple-\\nments. Their presence in a supplement is usually identi-\\nfied on the label as Dunaliella salina or as some related\\ntype of algae. D. salina produces 10 to 100 times more\\nbeta-carotene than carrots. It grows in areas with strong\\nsunlight, high temperatures, and salty water, environ-\\nments where antioxidants are greatly needed for protec-\\ntion from free radicals. A dose for adults for beta-\\ncarotene may range up to 10–15 mg, or 25,000 IU, daily.\\nLutein is prepared from marigold petals as either free\\nlutein or lutein ester. Both forms are absorbed well by the\\nbody, though preliminary research has shown that lutein\\nester may be assimilated slightly better and be retained\\nslightly longer than free lutein. For general health, 4–6\\nmg of lutein should be satisfactory. For those at risk for\\nmacular degeneration, 30–40 mg daily may be useful.\\nLycopene supplements are prepared from tomatoes.\\nA typical daily dose is 4 mg, which is the amount in one\\nlarge ripe tomato. Zeaxanthin is not available as a sup-\\nplement. However, the body can convert some lutein to\\nzeaxanthin. Also lutein supplements usually contain\\nsome zeaxanthin.\\nMixed carotenoid supplements are available, with\\ndifferent formulations. For example, one typical formula\\ncontains mostly beta-carotene, with smaller amounts of\\nlutein, zeaxanthin, and cryptoxanthin. Another type con-\\ntains less beta-carotene but a higher percentage of alpha-\\ncarotene. Mixed carotenes may also be included in some\\nmulti-vitamin and multi-oxidant supplements. Labels of\\nsupplements should be read carefully to determine the\\ntypes of carotenoids present and their dosages.\\nA person consuming the typical American diet ob-\\ntains only about 1.5 mg of carotenoids per day.

The United States Department of Agriculture\\nand the National Cancer Institute have suggested that per-\\nhaps 5–6 mg of carotenoids should be a dietary target. A\\nstudy completed in 2001 found that the carotenoids pre-\\nsent in fruit increased as fruit ripened and that greater\\nconcentrations can be found in the peels than in the pulp.\\nTo enhance dietary health benefits, it may be useful\\nto supplement a diet high in fruits and vegetables with an\\nadditional 10–15 mg of carotenoids per day. Those with\\npoor diets may consider supplementation with 25 mg of\\nsupplementation per day. Since it is not possible to put\\nevery beneficial carotenoid in a supplement, the best way\\nto obtain a wide variety of carotenoids is to eat a diet\\ncontaining an assortment of carotenoid-containing foods.\\nResearch has not yet answered the question of\\nwhether a person requires additional vitamin A if he is\\ntaking beta-carotene supplements. Vitamin A is only\\navailable in foods of animal origin, so vegetarians should\\nconsider using vitamin A supplements. Persons with dis-\\neases such as diabetes may not be as efficient in convert-\\ning beta-carotene into vitamin A, so they need to get\\nsome from their diet or from supplements.\\nPrecautions\\nA study conducted to investigate the effects of vita-\\nmin E and beta-carotene on the incidence of lung cancer\\nand other cancers in male smokers indicated that, in the\\nsubjects who were heavy smokers and also were heavy\\ndrinkers, beta-carotene supplements may result in in-\\ncreased adverse health effects, including a slight increase\\nin cancer. Another study of smokers indicated that high\\nsupplemental doses of beta-carotene and vitamin A in-\\ncreased the risk of lung cancer (though in former smok-\\ners, beta-carotene and vitamin A decreased the chances\\nof developing lung cancer). Additional studies are being\\nconducted to further investigate the effects of beta-\\ncarotene supplementation. However, it would be prudent\\nfor those who drink heavily or smoke to avoid the use of\\nbeta-carotene supplements and vitamin A.\\nSide effects\\nA person taking high doses of beta-carotene and\\nother carotenoids may develop a yellowish color on his\\nfeet and hands.

Therefore the use of a mixed\\ncarotenoid supplement in combination with a multi-an-\\ntioxidant formula, along with a diet rich in a variety of\\nfruits and vegetables, is most desirable.\\nCarotenoid supplements are readily assimilated by\\nthe body, but to optimize absorption, they should be\\ntaken with the highest fat-content meal of the day.\\nResearch has not yet determined how the consump-\\ntion of one type of carotenoid as a supplement may af-\\nfect the absorption of other carotenoids.

The Gale Group.)\\nDescription\\nThe carpal tunnel is an area in the wrist where the\\nbones and ligaments create a small passageway for the\\nmedian nerve. The median nerve is responsible for both\\nsensation and movement in the hand, in particular the\\nthumb and first three fingers. When the median nerve is\\ncompressed, an individual’s hand will feel as if it has\\n“gone to sleep.”\\nWomen between the ages of 30 and 60 have the\\nhighest rates of carpal tunnel syndrome. Research has\\ndemonstrated that carpal tunnel syndrome is a significant\\ncause of missed work days due to pain. In 1995, about\\n$270 million was spent on sick days taken for pain from\\nrepetitive motion injuries.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCompression of the median nerve in the wrist can\\noccur during a number of different conditions, particu-\\nlarly those conditions which lead to changes in fluid ac-\\ncumulation throughout the body. Because the area of the\\nwrist through which the median nerve passes is very nar-\\nrow, any swelling in the area will lead to pressure on the\\nmedian nerve. This pressure will ultimately interfere\\nwith the nerve’s ability to function normally. Pregnancy,\\nobesity , arthritis, certain thyroid conditions, diabetes,\\nand certain pituitary abnormalities all predispose to\\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Other conditions that increase\\nthe risk for carpal tunnel syndrome include some forms\\nof arthritis and various injuries to the arm and wrist (in-\\ncluding fractures , sprains, and dislocations). Further-\\nmore, activities which cause a person to repeatedly bend\\nthe wrist inward toward the forearm can predispose to\\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Certain jobs that require repeat-\\ned strong wrist motions carry a relatively high risk of\\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Injuries of this type are referred\\nto as “repetitive motion” injuries, and are more frequent\\namong secretaries who do a lot of typing, people work-\\ning at computer keyboards or cash registers, factory\\nworkers, and some musicians.\\nSymptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome include numb-\\nness, burning, tingling, and a prickly pin-like sensation\\nover the palm surface of the hand, and into the thumb,\\nforefinger, middle finger, and half of the ring finger.\\nSome individuals notice a shooting pain which goes from\\nthe wrist up the arm, or down into the hand and fingers.\\nWith continued median nerve compression, an individual\\nmay begin to experience muscle weakness, making it dif-\\nficult to open jars and hold objects with the affected hand.\\nEventually, the muscles of the hand served by the median\\nnerve may begin to grow noticeably smaller (atrophy),\\nespecially the fleshy part of the thumb. Untreated, carpal\\ntunnel syndrome may eventually result in permanent\\nweakness, loss of sensation, or even paralysis of the\\nthumb and fingers of the affected hand.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is made in\\npart by checking to see whether the patient’s symptoms\\ncan be brought on by holding his or her hand with the\\nwrist bent for about a minute. Wrist x rays are often\\ntaken to rule out the possibility of a tumor causing pres-\\nsure on the median nerve. A physician examining a pa-\\ntient suspected of having carpal tunnel syndrome will\\nperform a variety of simple tests to measure muscle\\nstrength and sensation in the affected hand and arm. Fur-\\nther testing might include electromyographic or nerve\\nconduction velocity testing to determine the exact severi-\\nty of nerve damage.

In 2002, a report stated that three medical\\norganizations had concluded that electrodiagnostic stud-\\nies were the preferred methods of diagnosing carpal tun-\\nnel syndrome, offering the highest degrees of sensitivity\\nand specificity.\\nTreatment\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is initially treated with\\nsplints, which support the wrist and prevent it from flex-\\ning inward into the position that exacerbates median\\nnerve compression. Some people get significant relief by\\nwearing such splints to sleep at night, while others will\\nneed to wear the splints all day, especially if they are\\nperforming jobs that stress the wrist.\\nThe activity which caused the condition should be\\navoided whenever possible. Also, the actions of making\\na fist, holding objects, and typing should be reduced. The\\npatient’s work area should be modified to reduce stress\\non the body. This may be achieved by correct positioning\\nand with ergonomically designed furniture. Performing\\nhand and wrist exercises periodically throughout the day\\ncan be beneficial.\\nResearchers found that the carpal ligament can be\\nlengthened or released without surgery through osteo-\\npathic manipulation and weight loading. Combining the\\ntwo gives additional benefit because manipulation length-\\nens the ligament at one end and weight loading increases\\nthe length at the other end. Patients can be taught a\\nstretching exercise for self-manipulation of the ligament.\\nA National Institute of Health (NIH) panel conclud-\\ned that traditional acupuncture may be a useful alterna-\\ntive or complementary treatment for carpal tunnel syn-\\ndrome. Studies have shown that both laser acupuncture\\nand microamp transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation\\n(TENS) can significantly reduce the pain associated with\\ncarpal tunnel syndrome. Both of these therapies are pain-\\nless. Greater than 90% of the patients treated reported no\\npain or pain that had been reduced by more than half. Pa-\\ntients in this study were also using Chinese herbal medi-\\ncines, deep acupuncture (including needle acupuncture),\\nmoxibustion, and omega-3 fish oil capsules. All patients\\nwere able to return to work and the pain of most patients\\nremained stable for up to two years. Persons over the age\\nof 60 years had a poorer response.\\nSome studies have shown that persons with carpal\\ntunnel syndrome are deficient in vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)\\nand that supplementation with this vitamin is beneficial.\\nCarpal tunnel syndrome should improve within two to\\nthree months by taking 100 mg three times daily. The pa-\\ntient should consult with his or her physician when taking\\nhigh doses of this vitamin.\\nChinese and homeopathic remedies include:\\n• arnica; 30c dose\\n• astra essence\\n• Rhus toxicodendron; 6c dose\\n• Ruta graveolens; 6c dose\\nAllopathic treatment\\nIbuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\\ndrugs may be prescribed to decrease pain and swelling.\\nDiuretics may be used if the syndrome is related to the\\nmenstrual cycle. When carpal tunnel syndrome is more\\nadvanced, steroids may be injected into the wrist to de-\\ncrease inflammation.\\nThe most severe cases of carpal tunnel syndrome\\nmay require surgery to decrease the compression of the\\nmedian nerve and restore its normal function. Such a re-\\npair involves cutting that ligament that crosses the wrist,\\nthus allowing the median nerve more room and decreas-\\ning compression. This surgery is done almost exclusively\\non an outpatient basis and is often performed without the\\npatient having to be made unconscious. Careful injection\\nof numbing medicines (local anesthesia) or nerve blocks\\n(the injection of anesthetics directly into the nerve) cre-\\nate sufficient numbness to allow the surgery to be per-\\nformed painlessly, without the risks associated with gen-\\neral anesthesia. Recovery from this type of surgery is\\nusually quick and without complications.\\nIn 2002, researchers in the Netherlands reported that\\nafter studying about 80 patients over two years, surgery\\nproved more successful than nighttime splints in freeing\\nup compressed nerves of patients with carpal tunnel syn-\\ndrome. Many patients in the splint group ended up\\nchoosing the surgery option after several months of\\nwearing splints.\\nExpected results\\nWithout treatment, continued pressure on the median\\nnerve puts the patient at risk for permanent disability in the\\naffected hand.

Other pro-\\nposed explanations of the effectiveness of bovine carti-\\nlage include the inhibition of protease, which is an en-\\nzyme that helps to break down proteins; and by blocking\\nthe formation of enzymes that break down collagen pro-\\nteins. Numerous bovine cartilage supplements have been\\nmade available for immunostimulation or to fight off\\ncancer cells. Most reports on tumor response and the sur-\\nvival of cancer patients after cartilage treatment, howev-\\ner, are anecdotal.\\nShark cartilage supplements\\nThe use of shark cartilage to treat cancer is based on\\nthe claim that it blocks angiogenesis, or the development\\nof new blood vessels that tumors need to survive. A re-\\nsearcher at Harvard Medical School in the 1970s, Judah\\nFolkman, M.D., developed the theory of angiogenesis.\\nDr. Folkman’s proposal that tumors, much like a normal\\norgan or mass of cells, require a supply of blood to deliv-\\ner nutrients for growth, has since become closely linked\\nto the treatment of cancer with shark cartilage.\\nIn 1983, William Lane, Ph.D., motivated by Folk-\\nman’s research, began investigating the possible link be-\\ntween shark cartilage and its ability to starve tumors with\\nan antiangiogenetic mechanism. In 1993, Lane published\\nhis book Sharks Don’t Get Cancer, making shark cartilage\\none of the leading alternative cancer therapies, with 99% of\\nthe cartilage market in 1997 comprised of shark cartilage.\\nThe use of shark cartilage as an alternative treatment\\nhas been opposed by wildlife experts who say that use of\\nthe substance threatens the shark population. According\\nto figures for 1997, more than one hundred thousand\\nsharks are killed each year to produce cartilage products.\\nFurther research has also shattered the myth that sharks\\ndo not get cancer. A study discussed at a cancer research\\nmeeting in 2000 documented about a dozen cases of ap-\\nparent cancer in sharks, including cancer of the cartilage.\\nBoth shark and bovine cartilage have been used to\\ntreat a wide variety of cancers, including tumors of the\\nbreast, ovary, cervix, prostate, rectum, colon, stomach,\\nkidney, and brain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion (FDA) maintains that both types of cartilage can be\\ntested as potential cancer therapy in clinical trials, but\\nmust be sold strictly as dietary supplements. Dietary sup-\\nplement manufacturers are also prohibited from making\\nspecific claims that the supplements can cure disease.\\nWhile some studies have shown positive results\\nfrom both bovine and shark supplements as a treatment\\nfor cancer, continued research is being conducted to de-\\ntermine their effectiveness. Some studies indicate that\\nthe proposed antiangiogenetic effects of shark cartilage\\nare ultimately destroyed by digestion, and the substance\\ntherefore is unlikely to be effective when taken orally.\\nThe results from the phase II Cancer Treatment Centers\\nof America (CTCA) shark cartilage study were pub-\\nlished in November 1998. The report concluded that oral\\nshark cartilage given as a single agent was ineffective in\\n47 patients with advanced cancer.\\nChondroitin sulfate\\nChondroitin is best known to the general public as a\\nremedy for osteoarthritis, which is a form of arthritis\\ncaused by wearing away or degeneration of the cartilage\\nthat cushions the ends of bones. It is thought that the\\ndrying out of cartilage tissue in osteoarthritis is a major\\ncause of tissue destruction. Chondroitin sulfate is given\\ntogether with glucosamine, a compound that is a build-\\ning block of cartilage. The chondroitin helps to attract\\nand hold fluid within cartilage tissue. Tissue fluid keeps\\ncartilage healthy in two ways: it acts as a shock absorber\\nwithin the joints of the body, thus protecting cartilage\\nfrom being worn away by the bones; and it carries nutri-\\nents to the cartilage.\\nSeveral randomized double-blind studies of chon-\\ndroitin in osteoarthritis patients were conducted in\\nFrance and Italy in 1998. The European studies demon-\\nstrated that oral, as well as injected, chondroitin helps to\\nincrease joint mobility and reduce pain. A landmark\\n2001 study showed that combining glucosamine and\\nchondroitin worked better than either alone in preventing\\ncartilage damage and that both supplements worked well\\nwhen taken orally.\\nPreparations\\nShark and bovine cartilage supplements are avail-\\nable in capsule form, while shark is also sold as a pow-\\nder and liquid. Shark supplements are made from\\nground-up shark skeletons (mainly the fins and head),\\nwhile bovine supplements are prepared from the carti-\\nlage taken from cow bones. Chondroitin sulfate can be\\ntaken orally as a pill, powder, or liquid. It can also be ad-\\nministered by injection. Oral preparations of chon-\\ndroitin, by itself or in combination with glucosamine, are\\navailable in the United States as over-the-counter (OTC)\\ndietary supplements. They can be purchased over the In-\\nternet, at pharmacies, health food stores, or even some\\ngrocery stores.\\nThe recommended dosage of shark and bovine carti-\\nlage varies per person and individual need.

The castor seed, or bean, is the\\nsource of numerous economically important products as\\none of the world’s most important industrial oils, and\\nwas one of the earliest commercial products. Castor\\nbeans have been found in ancient Egyptian tombs dating\\nlowered. The recommended bovine cartilage dosage per\\nday is 9 g. With both supplements, patients must keep\\ntaking the same dose, and include the supplements in\\ntheir diets for life. The cost of shark cartilage for six\\nmonths of therapy was estimated at $3,000–6,000 in\\n1997. The same amount of bovine cartilage was estimat-\\ned to cost about $1,000 at this time.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile cartilage supplements do not appear to be\\nharmful, persons who are considering them as a cancer\\ntreatment should not use them as their sole form of ther-\\napy and should consult their doctor before taking them.\\nPersons who are considering chondroitin as a treatment\\nfor joint pain should be careful not to diagnose them-\\nselves. They should check with their physician to be sure\\nthat the pain is caused by osteoarthritis. Some condi-\\ntions, including Lyme disease , gout, bursitis , and\\nrheumatoid arthritis , can also cause pain in the joints.\\nAlthough chondroitin appears to be helpful in treating\\nosteoarthritis, it is not useful for these other conditions.\\nChondroitin has not been studied in children or in preg-\\nnant or nursing women.\\nSide effects\\nBoth shark and bovine cartilage supplements show\\nlittle or no side effects when taken at the appropriate\\ndosage levels. Some patients have reported an allergic\\nreaction to traces of bovine protein or other side effects\\nthat include a bad taste in the mouth,fatigue, and nau-\\nsea. Shark cartilage can cause hypercalcemia (excessive\\namounts of calcium in the body) when taken at the rec-\\nommended daily dose of 70 g per day. This dosage re-\\nsults in 14 times the amount of calcium recommended by\\nthe United States Recommended Daily Allowance\\n(USRDA). Some patients taking chondroitin have been\\nknown to experience nausea and gas or bloating.\\nInteractions\\nChondroitin sulfate is not known to cause any sig-\\nnificant interactions with other medications.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 386}, page_content='back to 4000 B.C. According to the Ebers Papyrus, an\\nEgyptian medical text from 1500 B.C., Egyptian doctors\\nused castor oil to protect the eyes from irritation. The oil\\nfrom the bean was used thousands of years ago in facial\\noils and in wick lamps for lighting. Castor oil has been\\nused medicinally in the United States since the days of\\nthe pioneers. Traveling medicine men in the late 1800s\\npeddled castor oil, often mixed with as much as 40% al-\\ncohol, as a heroic cure for everything from constipation\\nto heartburn . It was also used to induce labor. At the\\npresent time, castor oil is used internally as a laxative\\nand externally as a castor oil pack or poultice.\\nThe castor plant, whose botanical name is Ricinus\\ncommunis , is native to the Ethiopian region of east\\nAfrica. It now grows in tropical and warm temperate re-\\ngions throughout the world and is becoming an abundant\\nweed in the southwestern United States. Castor plants\\ngrow along stream banks, river beds, bottom lands, and\\nin almost any warm area where the soil is well drained\\nand with sufficient nutrients and moisture to sustain\\ngrowth. They are annuals that can grow 6–15 ft (1.8–5\\nm) tall in one season with full sunlight, heat, and mois-\\nture. The tropical leaves, with five to nine pointed, fin-\\nger-like lobes, may be 4–30 in (10–76 cm) across. Flow-\\ners occur on the plant (which is monoecious, meaning\\nthat there are separate male and female flowers on the\\nsame individual), during most of the year in dense termi-\\nnal clusters, with female flowers just above the male\\nflowers. Each female flower consists of a spiny ovary,\\nwhich develops into the fruit or seed capsule, and a\\nbright red structure with feathery branches (stigma\\nlobes) to receive pollen from the male flowers. Each\\nmale flower consists of a cluster of many stamens that\\nshed pollen that is distributed by wind. The spiny seed\\npod or capsule is composed of three sections, or carpels,\\nthat split apart at maturity. Each carpel contains a single\\nseed. As the carpel dries and splits open, the seed is\\nejected, often with considerable force. The seeds are\\nslightly larger than pinto beans and are covered with in-\\ntricate mottled designs, none of which have exactly the\\nsame pattern due to genetic variations. At one end of the\\nseed is a small spongy structure called the caruncle,\\nwhich aids in the absorption of water when the seeds\\nare planted.\\nThe name “castor” was given to the plant by English\\ntraders who confused its oil with the oil of another shrub,\\nVitex agnus—Castus, which the Spanish and Portuguese\\nin Jamaica called agno-casto. The scientific name of the\\nplant was given by the eighteenth-century Swedish natu-\\nralist Carolus Linnaeus. Ricinus is the Latin word for\\ntick; apparently Linnaeus thought the castor bean looked\\nlike a tick, especially a tick in engorged with blood, with\\nthe caruncle of the bean resembling the tick’s head.\\nCommunis means “common” in Latin. Castor plants\\nwere already commonly naturalized in many parts of the\\nworld by the eighteenth century.\\nThere are several cultivated varieties of the castor\\nplant, all of which have striking foliage colorations. The\\ncastor plant grows rapidly with little care and produces\\nlush tropical foliage. Its use as a cultivated plant should\\nbe discouraged because its seeds or beans are extremely\\npoisonous. Children should be taught to recognize and\\navoid the plant and its seeds, especially in the southwest-\\nern United States where it grows wild near residential\\nareas. Flower heads can be snipped off of castor plants as\\na protective measure.\\nThe active poison in the castor bean is ricin, a dead-\\nly water-soluble protein called a lectin. The ricin is left\\nin the meal or cake after the oil is extracted from the\\nbean, so castor oil does not contain any of the poison.\\nThe seed is only toxic if the outer shell is broken or\\nchewed. Humans and horses are most susceptible to\\nricin, although all pets and livestock should be kept away\\nfrom the castor seed. It has been estimated that gram for\\ngram, ricin is 6,000 times more deadly than cyanide and\\n12,000 times more deadly than rattlesnake venom. A\\ndose of only 70 /H9262grams, or one two-millionth of an\\nounce (roughly equivalent to the weight of a single grain\\nof table salt) is enough to kill a 160-pound person. Even\\nsmall particles in open sores or in the eyes may be fatal.\\nAs few as four ingested seeds can kill an adult human.\\nLesser amounts may result in vomiting, severe abdomi-\\nnal pain, diarrhea, increased heart rate, profuse sweat-\\ning, and convulsions. Signs of toxicity occur about\\n18–24 hours after ingestion. Ricin seems to cause\\nclumping (agglutination) and breakdown (hemolysis) of\\nred blood cells, hemorrhaging in the digestive tract, and\\ndamage to the liver and kidneys.\\nRicin has attracted considerable attention as of early\\n2003 because of its association with terrorist groups. Al-\\nthough ricin cannot easily be used against large groups\\nof people, it has been used to assassinate individuals by\\ninjection. The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-\\ntion (CDC) considers ricin a B-list bioterrorism agent,\\nmeaning that it is relatively easy to make and is consid-\\nered a moderate threat to life.\\nOn the positive side, ricin is being investigated as a\\ntool for cancer treatment. A promising use is the produc-\\ntion of an immunotoxin in which the protein ricin is\\njoined to monoclonal antibodies. The ricin-antibody con-\\njugate, which is produced in a test tube, should theoreti-\\ncally travel directly to the site of a tumor, where the ricin\\ncan destroy the tumor cells without damaging other cells\\nin the patient.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2370\\nCastor oil\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 370'),\n",

It has been used to clear the\\nbowels after food poisoning and to relieve constipation.\\nIt is sometimes used in hospitals to prepare the patient’s\\nabdomen for x rays of the colon or kidneys. Castor oil is\\nclassified as a stimulant laxative, also known as a contact\\nlaxative. This type of laxative encourages bowel move-\\nments by acting on the intestinal wall, increasing the\\nmuscle contractions that move along the stool mass.\\nStimulants are a popular type of laxative for self-treat-\\nment, but unfortunately are more likely to cause side ef-\\nfects. There are milder types of laxatives that may be\\nmore useful for inducing regularity and treating constipa-\\ntion. Generally laxatives should be used to provide short-\\nterm relief only, unless otherwise directed by a doctor.\\nCastor oil is frequently used in animal experiments\\nto test the effects of new medications on the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract.\\nIf castor oil has been prescribed by a doctor, his or\\nher instructions for the timing and quantity of doses\\nshould be followed. For self-treatment, users should fol-\\nlow the manufacturer’s instructions. At least 6–8 glasses\\n(8 oz each) of liquids should be taken each day to soften\\nthe stools. Castor oil is usually taken on an empty stom-\\nach for rapid effect. Because results usually occur within\\ntwo to six hours, castor oil is not usually taken late in the\\nday. The unpleasant taste of castor oil may be improved\\nby chilling it in the refrigerator for at least an hour. It\\nmay then be stirred into a glass of cold orange juice. Fla-\\nvored preparations of castor oil are also available.\\nExternal uses\\nCastor oil is also used topically to treat corns. The\\noil is applied once or twice daily directly to the corns,\\nwhich are surrounded with adhesive-backed corn aper-\\nture pads made of felt to hold the oil. The corns are then\\ncovered with hypoallergenic silk tape. After soaking with\\nthe castor oil, the corns will be softened for removal with\\na pumice stone. Castor oil can be used in a similar man-\\nner to remove warts. Castor oil is also used to treat ring-\\nworm, abscesses, bruises , dry skin, dermatitis , sun-\\nburn, open sores, and other skin conditions. Additional\\nless well-known uses of castor oil include hair tonics,\\ncosmetics, and contraceptive creams and jellies.\\nFor menstrual cramping, especially when fibroids\\nmay be present or when flows are heavy, castor oil packs\\nmay be placed on the abdomen for up to an hour. The\\npacks are made by soaking square or rectangular pieces\\nof cotton, cotton flannel, or undyed wool 2–4 in (5–10\\ncm) thick with 4–6 oz 118–177 ml) of castor oil. The\\npack is folded over once or twice, placed directly on the\\nabdomen, and covered with plastic wrap. Over the pack,\\na water bottle or a heating pad on a low setting may be\\nused to keep the pack warm. After use, the skin may be\\ncleansed with a warm solution of baking soda and water\\n(2 tsp of baking soda to 1 qt water). Some herbal thera-\\npists maintain that castor oil packs may aid in shrinking\\nsmall fibroids. Castor oil packs have also been used in\\nthe treatment of many other diseases and disorders, in-\\ncluding breast pain, digestive tract problems, abscesses,\\nhemorrhoids, wounds, and gallstones.\\nNonmedical uses\\nCastor oil and its derivatives also are used in many\\nindustrial products, including paint and varnish, fabric\\ncoatings and protective coverings, insulation, food con-\\ntainers, soap, ink, plastics, brake fluids, insecticidal oils,\\nand guns. It is a primary raw material for the production\\nof nylon and other synthetic resins and fibers, and a\\nbasic ingredient in racing motor oil for high-perfor-\\nmance automobile and motorcycle engines. Castor oil is\\nalso used as a fuel additive for two-cycle engines, im-\\nparting a distinctive aroma to their exhaust. Even though\\nit is malodorous and distasteful, it is the source of several\\nsynthetic flower scents and fruit flavors.\\nPreparations\\nCastor oil for medicinal purposes is pressed from\\nthe seeds of the castor plant and is slightly yellow or col-\\norless. It has a lingering nauseating aftertaste, even\\nthough peppermint or fruit juices are sometimes added\\nas flavor enhancers in an attempt to disguise its disagree-\\nable taste. Castor oil is available in both oil and emulsi-\\nfied liquid preparations.\\nPrecautions\\nCastor oil should not be used by a pregnant woman,\\nas it can cause contractions. Castor oil should not be used\\nif a patient is hypersensitive to the castor bean; or has an\\nintestinal obstruction, abdominal pain, cramping, bloat-\\ning, soreness,nausea, vomiting, fecal impaction, or any\\nsigns of appendicitis or an inflamed bowel. It should not\\nbe used by anyone for more than a week unless a doctor\\nhas ordered otherwise. Overuse of a laxative may lead to\\ndependence on it.

The outer layer of\\nthe eyeball consists of a transparent dome-shaped cornea\\nand an opaque white sclera, which is a fibrous mem-\\nbrane. The cornea and sclera help protect the eye. The\\nnext layer includes the iris, pupil, and ciliary body. The\\niris is the colored part of the eye; the pupil is the small\\ndark round hole in the middle of the iris. The pupil and\\niris allow light into the eye. The ciliary body contains\\nmuscles that help the eye to focus. The lens lies behind\\nthe pupil and iris. It is covered by a cellophane-like cap-\\nsule. The lens is normally transparent, elliptical in shape,\\nand somewhat elastic. This elasticity allows the lens to\\nfocus on both near and far objects. The lens is attached\\nto the ciliary body by fibers (zonules of Zinn).

This changing of shape is called\\naccommodation. As people age, the lens hardens and ac-\\ncommodates less easily, which makes it harder for the\\nperson to see close objects. This hardening of the lens\\ngenerally occurs around the age of 40 and continues until\\nabout age 65. The condition is called presbyopia. It is a\\nnormal condition of aging, generally resulting in the\\nneed for reading glasses.\\nThe lens is made up of approximately 35% protein\\nand 65% water. As people age, the proteins in the lens\\nbegin to degenerate. Changes in the proteins, water con-\\ntent, enzymes, and other chemicals are some of the caus-\\nes of cataract formation.\\nThe major parts of the lens are the nucleus, the cor-\\ntex, and the capsule. The nucleus is in the center of the\\nlens, the cortex surrounds the nucleus, and the capsule is\\nthe outer layer. Opaque areas can develop in any part of\\nthe lens. Cataracts, then, can be classified according to\\nlocation (nuclear, cortical, or posterior subcapular\\ncataracts). The density and location of the cataract deter-\\nmines the extent of vision affected. If the cataract forms\\nin the area of the lens directly behind the pupil, the per-\\nson’s vision may be significantly impaired. A cataract\\nthat occurs on the outer edges or side of the lens will\\ncause less severe impairment.\\nCataracts in the elderly are so common that they are\\nconsidered a normal part of the aging process. People\\nbetween the ages of 52–64 have a 50% chance of devel-\\noping a cataract, while at least 70% of those 70 and older\\nare affected. Cataracts associated with aging (senile or\\nage-related cataracts) most often occur in both eyes, with\\neach cataract progressing at a different rate. At first,\\nthese cataracts may not affect vision. If the cataract re-\\nmains small or at the periphery of the lens, the visual\\nchanges may be minor.\\nCataracts that occur in people other than the elderly\\nare much less common. Congenital cataracts occur very\\nrarely in newborns. Genetic defects or an infection or\\ndisease in the mother during pregnancy are among the\\ncauses of congenital cataracts. There is a condition\\ncalled blue cataracts, which is inheritance-linked and af-\\nfects primarily Tibetans and some other Asians. Trau-\\nmatic cataracts may develop after an injury or foreign\\nbody damages the lens or eye. Systemic illnesses like di-\\nabetes may result in cataracts. Cataracts can also occur\\nsecondary to other eye diseases—for example, an in-\\nflammation of the inner layer of the eye (uveitis) or\\nglaucoma. Such cataracts are called complicated\\ncataracts. Toxic cataracts result from chemical toxicity,\\nsuch as steroid use. Cataracts can also result from expo-\\nsure to the sun’s ultraviolet (UV) rays.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nRecent studies have been conducted to determine\\nwhether diet or the use of vitamins might have an effect\\non the formation of cataracts in older people. Although\\ndebate continues, several studies reported in late 2001\\nthat a diet rich in certain caretenoids may protect against\\ndevelopment of cataracts. Likewise, there has been con-\\nsiderable interest in the use of antioxidant supplements\\nas a protection against cataracts. Such antioxidant vita-\\nmins as vitamins A, C, E, and beta-carotene protect body\\ntissues against free radicals, which are byproducts of ox-\\nidation. Vitamin C in particular, has shown the strongest\\nimpact on lower rates of cataracts. Some vitamins are\\nmarketed specifically for the eyes. Patients should speak\\nto their doctors about the use of such vitamins.\\nStudies also have recently linked changes in lens\\nproteins to cataract formation. Soluble proteins in the\\nlens begin to condense and form clumps, leading to\\ncataracts. Researchers have identified mutations in genes\\nthat likely lead to protein changes resulting in juvenile\\ncataracts. The next step is to study a possible genetic re-\\nlationship to formation of age-related cataracts as well.\\nSmoking and alcohol intake have been implicated\\nin cataract formation. Some studies have determined that\\na diet high in fat will increase the likelihood of cataract\\nformation, while eating more foods rich in antioxidants\\nwill lower the risk. More research is needed to determine\\nif diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, or vitamins have\\nany connection to the formation of cataracts.\\nCataracts may have the following symptoms:\\n• gradual, painless onset of blurry, filmy, or fuzzy vision\\n• poor central vision\\n• frequent changes in eyeglass prescription\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 373'),\n",

Only an ophthalmologist, how-\\never, can perform cataract extraction.\\nCataracts are easily diagnosed from the reporting of\\nsymptoms, a visual acuity examination using an eye\\nchart, and by a physician or optometrist’s examination of\\nthe eye. Shining a penlight into the pupil may reveal\\nopacities or a color change of the lens even before the\\npatient develops visual symptoms. A slit lamp, which is\\nbasically a large microscope, allows the doctor to exam-\\nine the front of the eye and the lens, and to determine the\\nlocation of the cataract.\\nSome other diagnostic tests may be used to determine\\nif cataracts are present or how much improvement the pa-\\ntient may have after surgery. These tests include a glare\\ntest, potential vision test, and contrast sensitivity test.\\nTreatment\\nBecause free radicals have been implicated as a\\ncause of cataracts, alternative therapies emphasize the\\nimportance of a healthful diet, nutritional supplements\\nand/or herbal remedies to prevent and slow down the\\nprogression of cataracts.\\nNutritional therapy\\nA naturopathic doctor or a nutritionist may recom-\\nmend the following dietary changes:\\n• Reduce consumption of salty or fatty foods. Diabetics\\nshould also limit their intake of milk and other dairy\\nproducts.\\n• Increase intake of foods that are high in beta-carotene:\\npeaches, apricots, berries, carrots, and leafy green veg-\\netables. Beta-carotene and other antioxidants can pro-\\ntect against or slow down the development of cataracts.\\n• Stop cigarette smoking and avoid exposure to second-\\nhand smoke.\\n• Eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables with high con-\\ncentrations of vitamin C. Take supplemental vitamin C\\n(1 g three times daily) and vitamin A (25,000 IU per\\nday).\\n• Take supplemental beta-carotene (25,000–100,000 IU\\nper day) and selenium (400 mcg per day). Low seleni-\\num levels may increase the risk of cataracts.\\n• Increase intake of L-cysteine (400 mg per day), L-glut-\\namine (200 mg per day), and L-glycine (200 mg per\\nday). These three amino acids may be beneficial to\\nsome cataract patients.\\n• Add other supplements: zinc, lutein, riboflavin , and\\ncod liver oil.\\nHerbal therapy\\nThere are two herbal remedies that may help protect\\nthe eyes against cataracts:\\n• Bilberries (40–80 mg daily). Early research indicates\\nthat eating bilberries may halt cataract progression.\\n• Hachimijiogan . Hachimijiogan is an ancient Chinese\\nherbal formula. Animal studies suggest that it may pro-\\ntect the eyes against cataracts by increasing the glu-\\ntathione content of the lens.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nCataracts that cause no symptoms or only minor vi-\\nsual changes may not require any treatment. An ophthal-\\nmologist or optometrist should continue to monitor and\\nassess the cataract at scheduled office visits. Stronger\\nprescription eyeglasses or contact lenses may be helpful.\\nCataract surgery is the only option for patients\\nwhose cataracts interfere with vision to the extent of af-\\nfecting their daily lives. It is the most frequently per-\\nformed surgery in the United States. It generally im-\\nproves vision in over 90% of patients. Some people have\\nheard that a cataract should be “ripe” before being re-\\nmoved. A “ripe” or mature cataract means that the lens is\\ncompletely opaque. Most cataracts are removed before\\nthey reach that stage. Sometimes cataracts need to be re-\\nmoved so that the doctor can examine the back of the eye\\nmore carefully. Patients with diseases that may affect the\\neye may require cataract surgery for this reason. If\\ncataracts are present in both eyes, only one eye at a time\\nshould be operated on. Healing occurs in the first eye be-\\nfore the second cataract is removed, sometimes as early\\nas the following week. A final eyeglass prescription is\\nusually given about four to six weeks after surgery. Pa-\\ntients will still need reading glasses. The overall health\\nof the patient needs to be considered in making the deci-\\nsion to operate.

It can be identified by the\\ndozens of small white flowers with small purple spots\\ncovering its flowering, spiky top. The aromatic herb is a\\nmember of the Lamaciae or mint family; in England it is\\nsometimes called catmint. Catnip is harvested in the sum-\\nmer and fall, and dried for medicinal use.\\nGeneral use\\nBoth the flowering tops and the leaves of the catnip\\nplant are used for medicinal purposes. Catnip is used to\\ntreat a variety of symptoms and illnesses, including:\\n• Gastrointestinal distress. Catnip has carminative prop-\\nerties, which means that it is helpful in preventing gas\\nand related nausea, colic, and diarrhea.\\n• Muscle cramps. The herb’s antispasmodic properties pro-\\nmote relaxationof the gastrointestinal muscles, the uterus\\n(for menstrual cramps), and other tight or sore muscles.\\n• Nervous disorders. Catnip can be used as a sedative to\\nrelieve stress, ease anxiety , relieve the symptoms of\\nmigraines and tension headaches, and promote general\\nrelaxation.\\n• Cold or flu with fever. Catnip is a diaphoretic, which\\nmeans that it promotes sweating. This property makes\\nit a valuable remedy in treating patients with feverish\\nconditions, including influenza, colds, and bronchitis.\\n• Cuts and scrapes. Catnip is an astringent, and can be\\napplied externally to cuts and scrapes to stop bleeding\\nand promote healing.\\nPreparations\\nCatnip is most commonly taken as an infusion, or\\ntea. The herb can be purchased in tea bags or in loose,\\ndried form. Tea bag infusions can be prepared according\\nto package directions. When using the dried form of the\\nherb, place 10 tsp of catnip in a piece of muslin or\\ncheesecloth, in an infuser, or loose, and submerge it in\\none liter of boiling water. After steeping the mixture in a\\ncovered container for ten minutes, strain the infusion be-\\nfore drinking.

The herb earns its\\nname from the curved thorns on the vine that resemble\\nthe claws of a cat. Also known by its Spanish equivalent\\nuña de gato,cat’s claw has a long history of use as a folk\\nmedicine by native peoples to treat intestinal complaints,\\nasthma, wounds, cancer, tumors, arthritis, inflamma-\\ntions, diabetes, irregularities of the menstrual cycle,\\nfevers, ulcers, dysentery, and rheumatism. They have\\nalso utilized the herb as a kidney cleanser, blood\\ncleanser, and contraceptive.\\nTwo species of cat’s claw are found in the rain for-\\nest: Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis. Al-\\nthough these species are similar in appearance and have\\nbeen used in many of the same ways, research on Uncar-\\nia tomentosa has revealed it to be more valuable as a\\ntherapeutic agent.\\nPrecautions\\nCatnip should always be obtained from a reputable\\nsource that observes stringent quality control procedures\\nand industry-accepted good manufacturing practices.\\nBotanical supplements are regulated by the FDA; however,\\nthey currently do not have to undergo any approval process\\nbefore reaching the consumer market. Herbs are presently\\nclassified as nutritional supplements rather than drugs.\\nLegislation known as the Dietary Supplement Health and\\nEducation Act (DSHEA) was passed in 1994 in an effort to\\nstandardize the manufacture, labeling, composition, and\\nsafety of botanicals and supplements. In January 2000, the\\nFDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition\\n(CFSAN) announced a ten-year plan for establishing and\\nimplementing these regulations by the year 2010.\\nAlthough there are no known side effects or health\\nhazards associated with recommended dosages of catnip\\npreparations, pregnant women, women who breastfeed,\\nand individuals with chronic medical conditions should\\nconsult with their healthcare professional before taking\\ncatnip or any other herb.\\nSide effects\\nCatnip has diuretic properties, and may increase the\\nfrequency and amount of urination.

He allegedly began exhibiting para-\\nnormal abilities as a child, for example memorizing his\\nschool lessons by sleeping with his head on his textbooks.\\nAt age 24, after undergoing hypnosis during which he pre-\\nscribed successful treatment for his own months-long bout\\nof laryngitis that had baffled his doctors, Cayce began to\\ndispense his readings. He gave these readings while he\\nwas in a trance-like state, leading to his designation as\\n“The Sleeping Prophet.” Over the course of his lifetime,\\nCayce gave readings on diverse subjects, including health,\\nreligion, dream interpretation, world affairs, and business.\\nAlthough some early readings were lost, at his death in\\n1945 more than 14,000 separate Edgar Cayce readings on\\nover 10,000 topics had been stenographically transcribed.\\nAlmost 9,000 readings address medical ailments.\\nBenefits\\nCayce’s holistic approach addresses the body, mind,\\nand spirit connection. The information offered in his read-\\nings is aimed at treating the whole person and helping\\npeople develop a self-awareness and responsibility for im-\\nproving their own physical health and spiritual well-being.\\nCayce’s readings focus on addressing the root cause\\nof an ailment rather than simply alleviating the symp-\\ntoms. Almost all of his physical readings address diet\\nand nutrition. He felt that providing the body key build-\\ning materials it needs to do its work is crucial, as is\\ndetoxification. Poor eliminations are the most cited\\ncause of disease in Cayce’s readings. He also addresses\\nvarious systemic imbalances in the nervous, circulatory,\\nand glandular systems, and acid/alkaline imbalances. In-\\nfection,stress, attitudes, and emotions are also central to\\nhis disease explanations.\\nRecommendations comprise an extensive variety of\\ntherapies too numerous to list here. They include con-\\nventional medicines and surgeries as well as alternative\\ntherapies such as electrotherapy,osteopathy , and mas-\\nsage. Readings often recommend herbs, chemical con-\\ncoctions, color and light therapies, colonics,castor oil ,\\nand taking on responsible, healthful attitudes and behav-\\niors such as dietary changes and prayer. Cayce even de-\\nveloped some original appliances to deliver his pre-\\nscribed treatments.\\nProponents of Cayce’s therapies claim healings rang-\\ning from routine to miraculous. Critics argue that many\\nrecommended therapies lack rigorous scientific research\\nand evaluation, and attribute “cures” to factors other than\\nCayce’s alleged psychic perception of medical needs.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2380\\nCayce systems\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAlkaloids—A group of organic compounds found\\nin plants that possess a wide range of therapeutic\\nproperties.\\nAntihypertensive —A medication given to lower\\nblood pressure.\\nDiuretic—A substance that increases the flow of\\nurine.

Reproduced by permission.)\\nDescription\\nCayce systems combines Cayce’s insights with\\nCayce-oriented health practitioners, lay persons, organi-\\nzations, training programs, researchers, and health prod-\\nucts. Treatment protocols are individualized for each pa-\\ntient. Clinicians may follow several different treatment\\nmodalities, emphasizing the uniqueness of each individ-\\nual patient and inclination of the clinician. This integra-\\ntion of treatment modalities is a principal concept of the\\nCayce approach. Establishing healthy habits and attitudes\\nare also central. Self-responsibility such as self-care and\\nhome care modalities (e.g., dietary changes, massage,\\netc.) is often incorporated. Clinicians may search the\\nCayce readings for the case most closely matching their\\npatient’s condition or medical diagnosis. However, most\\nreadings were given for a specific individual’s complaint.\\nInterpreting the readings is not always a straightforward\\ntask, since many subjects apparently had more disorders\\nthan the one addressed in the reading. Treatment may re-\\nquire experimentation and the Association for Research\\nand Enlightenment (A.R.E.) Health and Rejuvenation Re-\\nsearch Center (HRRC) recommends that it should be un-\\ndertaken and evaluated under the care of a physician\\ntrained in the Cayce approach.\\nAs in Cayce’s original recommendations, a wide\\nrange of therapeutic tools and treatments may be used.\\nThese may generally be arranged under the following\\ncategories:\\n• Manual therapy is therapeutic use of hands to diagnose\\nand treat illness. The Cayce system relies heavily on tra-\\nditional osteopathic applications together with modern\\nchiropractic, physical medicine and massage therapy.\\n• Electrotherapy includes several appliances and tech-\\nniques such as the wet cell battery, radial appliance, vi-\\nolet ray appliance, ultraviolet ray lamp, sinusoidal, x-\\nray, and magnetic therapy.\\n• Diet/Nutritional therapy focuses on acid/alkaline bal-\\nance and food combining with special diets for\\nstrengthening the blood, body, and nerves.\\n• Hydrotherapy (therapeutic use of water) includes\\ncolon therapy (irrigations), fume and steam baths, sitz\\nbaths, Epson salt baths, and various packs.\\n• Pharmacology relies heavily on natural remedies such\\nas herbal medicine and dietary supplements.\\n• Mental therapy covers a broad range of psychological\\nand psychosocial techniques such as cognitive-behav-\\nioral therapy, visualization, hypnosis, and environmen-\\ntal therapy.\\n• Spiritual healing includes interventions such as prayer,\\nmeditation, and laying on of hands.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThe Cayce transcripts are housed in the A.R.E. and\\nare available for general research. The library also has a\\ncollection of circulating files on various health conditions.\\nNumerous books organize information from the Cayce\\nreadings. As of 2000, the HRRC is conducting research\\nprojects including energy medicine , manual therapies,\\nacid/alkaline balance, and the nervous system. The HRRC\\nalso offers individual research protocols enabling individ-\\nuals to apply Cayce principles at home. They solicit anec-\\ndotal evidence on successful applications of Cayce modal-\\nities, invite clinicians using Cayce modalities to document\\noutcomes, and conduct historical research on osteopathic\\ntextbooks. They also team with the Meridian Institute (a\\nnon-profit organization dedicated to researching Cayce\\nhealth information) to look at specific illnesses.\\nTraining & certification\\nFour levels of certification are offered for Cayce sys-\\ntems. As described on the A.R.E. website, Cayce home\\nhealth therapists help patients apply Cayce information in\\ntheir home settings. Cayce physiotherapists have passed\\ncertifications in general manual therapy, hydrotherapy,\\nenergy medicine, and the basic Cayce diet. Cayce health\\ncase managers are certified in providing information and\\nsupport services (e.g., assessment, service planning, re-\\nferrals, and advocacy). Cayce physicians, in additional to\\nbeing licensed by their state boards, are certified in apply-\\ning Cayce system principles and techniques.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBolton, Brett.

He grew\\nup in rural Kentucky and received only a limited formal\\neducation. He was a member of the Christian Church\\n(Disciples of Christ). As an adult he began a career as a\\nphotographer.\\nCayce’s life took a radically different direction in\\n1898, after he developed a case of laryngitis. He was\\nhypnotized by a friend and while in the trance state pre-\\nscribed a cure that worked. Neighbors heard of the event\\nand asked Cayce to do similar “readings” for them. In\\n1909 he did a reading in which he diagnosed and cured\\na homeopathic physician, Dr. Wesley Ketchum. During\\nthe next years Cayce gave occasional sittings, but primar-\\nily worked in photography.\\nIn 1923, theosophist Arthur Lammers invited Cayce\\nto Dayton, Ohio, to do a set of private readings. These\\nreadings were noteworthy because they involved\\nCayce’s initial exploration of individual past lives. These\\nreadings encouraged Cayce to leave photography and\\nbecome a professional. Among his early supporters was\\nbusinessman Morton Blumenthal, who gave financial\\nbacking for Cayce Hospital (1928) and a school, At-\\nlantic University (1930). Unfortunately, Blumenthal was\\nfinancially destroyed by the Great Depression and both\\nenterprises failed.\\nIn 1932 Cayce organized the Association for Re-\\nsearch and Enlightenment (ARE). With the resources gen-\\nerated by the association, complete records of all the\\nreadings for the next 12 years were made. These formed a\\nhuge body of material, and Cayce’s readings were later\\nindexed, cross-referenced, and used as the basis of nu-\\nmerous books.\\nCayce died in 1945, and his son Hugh Lynn Cayce\\ncontinued the work of the association and promoted the\\nabilities of his father. Cayce’s work became known by a\\nlarge audience outside the psychic community in 1967\\nthrough a biographical book by Jess Stern, Edgar Cayce,\\nThe Sleeping Prophet.\\nEDGAR CAYCE 1877–1945\\n(Betmann/CORBIS.

The dried ripe fruit and seeds of the plant are\\nused for medicinal purposes. Cayenne is available in\\nmany forms, including capsules, ointments, liniments,\\ntinctures, creams, oils, and dried powders.\\nOrigin\\nCayenne was originally grown in Central and South\\nAmerica in pre-Columbian times. It was cultivated in\\nMexico 7,000 years ago and in Peru 4,000 years ago. Na-\\ntive Americans have used cayenne as a food and as a med-\\nicine for stomach aches, cramping pains,gas, and disor-\\nders of the circulatory system for 9,000 years. Cayenne\\nwas brought to Europe in the fifteenth century by Christo-\\npher Columbus. From Europe, cayenne was transported to\\ntropical regions around the world, where it is now grown.\\nGeneral use\\nToday cayenne is used worldwide to treat a variety\\nof health conditions, including weak digestion, chronic\\nsmell. Cayenne is a popular spice used in many different\\nregional styles of cooking, but it has also been used med-\\nicinally for thousands of years.\\nThe name cayenne is derived from a Tupi word,\\n“kyinha.” The cayenne plant produces long red peppers\\nand grows to a height of 2–6 ft (0.5–2 m). The plant is\\nnative to tropical areas of America and is cultivated\\nthroughout the world in tropic and subtropic climate\\nzones. Most of the United States’ cayenne supply is im-\\nported from India and Africa.\\nCayenne is a member of the genus Capsicum. Other\\nspecies of this genus include Tabasco peppers, African\\npeppers, Mexican chili peppers, bell peppers, pimentoes,\\npaprikas, and bird peppers. Cayenne is often referred to\\nas chili, which is the Aztec name for cayenne pepper.\\nThe main medicinal properties of cayenne are de-\\nrived from a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is the\\ningredient that gives peppers their heat. A pepper’s cap-\\nsaicin content ranges from 0–1.5%. Peppers are mea-\\nsured according to heat units. The degree of heat deter-\\nmines the peppers’ value and usage. Generally, the hotter\\nthe pepper, the more capsaicin it contains.

One Ayurvedic remedy for pain combines cayenne\\nand mustard seeds into a paste to be applied to the affect-\\ned area. Ayurvedic medicine also utilizes cayenne to\\ntreat gas and poor digestion. Chinese medicine employs\\ncayenne for digestive ailments. An ointment or tincture\\nmade from cayenne is used in China and Japan to heal\\nfrostbite and myalgia (muscle pains). The German Com-\\nmission E has approved cayenne in the treatment of\\npainful muscle spasms, arthritis, rheumatism,neuralgia,\\nlumbago, and chilblains.\\nDigestive aid\\nCayenne is used as a digestive aid throughout India,\\nthe East Indies, Africa, Mexico, and the Caribbean.\\nWhen taken internally, cayenne soothes the digestive\\ntract and stimulates the flow of saliva and stomach secre-\\ntions. These secretions contain substances that help di-\\ngest food.\\nCayenne is also used to relieve constipation as it\\nstimulates gastric secretions, thereby activating a slug-\\ngish gastrointestinal tract.\\nCirculatory helper\\nMany people take cayenne internally to treat and\\nprevent heart disease. The intake of cayenne has been\\nfound to have a positive effect on the circulatory system.\\nCayenne may reduce the risk of heart attacks. It has been\\nshown to lower cholesterol levels and the risk of blood\\nclots. Studies have shown cayenne to lower blood pres-\\nsure. A study in India showed that cayenne prevented a\\nrise in liver and serum cholesterol levels when taken\\nwith dietary cholesterol.\\nPain relief\\nCayenne is a proven remedy for the temporary relief\\nof pain, both external and internal. Its analgesic effect\\nacts to distract sensory nerves from the irritation or pain,\\nwhich results in a temporary abatement of pain. The cap-\\nsaicin in cayenne depletes substance P, a chemical that\\nsends pain signals to the brain from the local nervous\\nsystem. When there is a lack of substance P, the sensa-\\ntion of pain diminishes because it cannot reach the brain.\\nCapsaicin has been approved by the United States\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) for pain caused by\\nshingles, an adult disease that is caused by the virus that\\ncauses chicken pox in children. Such over-the-counter\\n(OTC) creams as Zostrix or Heet contain capsaicin and\\nare applied externally to treat rheumatic and arthritic\\npains, cluster headaches, diabetic foot pain, fibromyal-\\ngia, and post-herpetic nerve pain. These creams usually\\ncontain 0.025–0.075% capsaicin.\\nResearch in 2002 helped to quantify capsaicin’s pain\\nrelieving effects. Creams containing the compound low-\\nered pain in arthritis sufferers’ hands by 40 percent when\\nused four times a day and 77 percent of people with pain\\nfrom long-term shingles had reduced pain after using the\\ncream for four months. The study also said that cap-\\nsaicin-containing cream is less expensive and safer than\\nother painkillers used for the same conditions.\\nOther conditions\\nCayenne can be an effective remedy for relieving\\ncongestion and coughs. It acts to thin mucus, thus im-\\nproving the flow of body fluids. It is also used to boost\\nenergy and relieve stress-related fatigue and depression.\\nLate in the 1990s, British journals reported that people\\ntaking cayenne daily increased their fat metabolism and\\nhad decreased appetites. In addition, cayenne can be\\nused as a treatment to prevent thumb sucking and nail\\nbiting in children.\\nPreparations\\nInternal dosage: Cayenne should be taken internally\\nas directed by an experienced practitioner.\\nCreams: Use as directed. Generally creams must be\\napplied three or four times per day for two to three\\nweeks before their effects are felt.\\nOil: Cayenne oil may be rubbed on sprains, swelling,\\nand sore muscles and joints to relieve pain. It should not,\\nhowever, be applied to open cuts or broken skin.\\nTea: To ease gas and stomach cramps or to help pro-\\nmote digestion, a tea may be made by adding 0.25 tsp of\\ncayenne to 1 cup of hot water. When taken as a hot tea,\\ncayenne will induce sweating. Taken as a cold tea,\\ncayenne works as a diuretic, increasing urination.\\nCayenne teas, however, should not be given to children.\\nToothache: Chewing on a hot pepper may provide\\ntemporary relief from toothache.\\nCold feet: Ground cayenne added to talcum powder\\nor cornstarch can be placed inside a pair of socks. The\\ncayenne causes the blood vessels under the skin of the\\nfeet to dilate, thus stimulating extra blood flow and pro-\\nviding warmth to the feet.\\nSore throat: To treat a sore throat, combine cayenne\\nwith myrrh and gargle as needed. This mixture can also\\nbe used as an antiseptic mouthwash.

Gluten causes an inflammatory response in the\\nsmall intestine, which damages the tissues and results in\\nimpaired ability to absorb nutrients from foods.\\nDescription\\nCeliac disease—also called sprue, nontropical sprue,\\ngluten sensitive enteropathy, celiac sprue, and adult celiac\\ndisease—may be discovered at any age. Researchers be-\\nlieve that a combination of genetic and environmental\\nfactors trigger the disease. Environmental events that may\\nprovoke celiac disease in those with a genetic predisposi-\\ntion to the disorder include surgery or a viral infection.\\nThe disorder is more commonly found among white\\nEuropeans or those of European descent. The exact inci-\\ndence of the disease is uncertain. Estimates vary from one\\nin 5,000 to as many as one in every 300 individuals with\\nthis background. In 2002, new research in Italy followed\\npatients with type 1 diabetes. Celiac disease is 20 times\\nmore common among these patients than in the general\\npopulation, yet often goes undetected in these children. The\\nstudy authors recommended celiac disease screening pro-\\ngrams for children recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCeliac disease is caused by an inflammatory re-\\nsponse of the small intestine. The exact mechanism of\\nPrecautions\\nTo avoid irritating sensitive tissues, do not apply\\nheating pads or hot compresses to areas of the skin\\nwhere cayenne has been applied.\\nDo not apply cayenne to an area for longer than two\\ndays since the heat may cause nerve damage. Allow four\\ndays to pass before applying cayenne in the same loca-\\ntion.\\nAvoid contact with mucous membranes, eyes, open\\nwounds, and sensitive areas.\\nWash hands after using cayenne or wear gloves\\nwhen applying it externally.\\nPersons with an active gastrointestinal ulcer should\\nnot use cayenne internally without consulting a physi-\\ncian.\\nSide effects\\nCayenne may irritate the mouth, throat, eyes, and\\nopen wounds. Drinking a glass of milk may relieve burn-\\ning in the mouth and throat caused by consumption of\\ncayenne. The protein in the milk helps to counteract the\\ncapsaicin.\\nLarge internal doses of cayenne may produce vom-\\niting and/or stomach pain.\\nInteractions\\nAsthma patients who are taking theophylline should\\nconsult a physician before taking cayenne.

The resulting in-\\nflammation causes damage to the delicate finger-like\\nstructures in the intestine, called villi, where food ab-\\nsorption actually takes place.\\nThe most commonly recognized symptoms of celiac\\ndisease relate to the improper absorption of food in the\\ngastrointestinal system. The patient will have diarrhea\\nand fatty, greasy, unusually foul-smelling stools. The pa-\\ntient may complain of excessive gas (flatulence), dis-\\ntended abdomen, weight loss, and generalized weakness.\\nNot all patients have these problems. Unrecognized\\nceliac disease may cause or contribute to a variety of\\nother conditions. The decreased ability to digest, absorb,\\nand utilize food properly (malabsorption) may cause\\nanemiafrom iron deficiency or easy bruising from a\\nlack of vitamin K . Poor mineral absorption may result\\nin osteoporosis, which may lead to bone fractures. Vit-\\namin D levels may be insufficient and bring about a\\n“softening” of bones (osteomalacia), which produces\\npainand bony deformities. Defects in the tooth enamel,\\ncharacteristic of celiac disease, may also occur. Celiac\\ndisease may be discovered during medical tests per-\\nformed to investigate failure to thrive in infants, or lack\\nof proper growth in children and adolescents. People\\nwith celiac disease may also experience lactose intoler-\\nance because they do not produce enough of the enzyme\\nlactase, which breaks down the sugar in milk into a form\\nthe body can absorb.\\nA distinctive skin rash, called dermatitis herpeti-\\nformis, may be the first sign of celiac disease. Approxi-\\nmately 10% of patients with celiac disease have this\\nrash, but it is estimated that 85% or more of patients with\\nthe rash have the disease.\\nBecause of the variety of ways celiac disease can\\nmanifest itself, it is often not discovered promptly. The\\ncondition may persist without diagnosis for so long that\\nthe patient accepts a general feeling of illness as normal.\\nThis leads to further delay in identifying and treating the\\ndisorder.\\nDiagnosis\\nIf celiac disease is suspected, a blood test that looks\\nfor the antibodies that the immune system produces in\\nceliac disease is ordered. Some experts advocate not just\\nevaluating patients with symptoms, but using these blood\\nstudies as a screening test for high-risk individuals, such\\nas those with relatives known to have the disorder. An\\nabnormal result points towards celiac disease, but further\\ntests are needed to confirm the diagnosis. Other tests\\nmay be ordered to look for nutritional deficiencies. For\\nexample, doctors may order a test of iron levels in the\\nblood because low levels of iron (anemia) may accompa-\\nny celiac disease. Doctors may also order a test for fat in\\nthe stool, since celiac disease prevents the body from ab-\\nsorbing fat from food.\\nThe next step is a biopsy of the small intestine. This\\nis usually done by a gastroenterologist, a physician who\\nspecializes in diagnosing and treating bowel disorders. It\\nis generally performed in the office, or in an outpatient\\ndepartment in a hospital. The patient remains awake, but\\nis sedated. A narrow tube is passed through the mouth,\\ndown through the stomach, and into the small intestine. A\\nsmall sample of tissue is taken and sent to the laboratory\\nfor analysis. If it shows a pattern of tissue damage charac-\\nteristic of celiac disease, the diagnosis is established.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet\\n(GFD). This may be easy for the doctor to prescribe, but\\ndifficult for the patient to follow. Gluten is present in any\\nproduct that contains wheat, rye, barley, or oats. It helps\\nmake bread rise, and gives many foods a smooth, pleas-\\ning texture.\\nIn addition to the many obvious places gluten can be\\nfound in a normal diet, such as breads, cereals, and\\npasta, there are many hidden sources of gluten. These in-\\nclude ingredients added to foods to improve texture or\\nenhance flavor and products used in food packaging.\\nGluten may even be present on surfaces used for food\\npreparation or cooking.\\nFresh foods that have not been artificially processed,\\nsuch as fruits, vegetables, and meats, are permitted as\\npart of a GFD. Gluten-free foods can be found in health\\nfood stores, mail-order companies, and in some super-\\nmarkets. Help in dietary planning is available from sup-\\nport groups for individuals with celiac disease. There are\\nmany cookbooks on the market specifically for those on\\na GFD.\\nTreating celiac disease with a GFD is almost always\\ncompletely effective in alleviating symptoms. Secondary\\ncomplications, such as anemia and osteoporosis, resolve\\nin almost all patients. People who have experienced lac-\\ntose intolerance related to their celiac disease usually see\\nthose symptoms subside as well.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nBoth complementary and allopathic healthcare prac-\\ntitioners generally agree that a gluten-free diet is the best\\ntreatment for celiac disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2386\\nCeliac disease\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 386'),\n",

They are very similar to\\nhomeopathy, and may be prescribed by a homeopathic\\ndoctor.\\nThe 12 cell salts are as follows:\\n• Calcarea fluor (calcium fluoride)\\n• Calcarea phos (calcium phosphate)\\n• Calcarea sulph (calcium sulfate)\\n• Ferrum phos (iron phosphate)\\n• Kali mur (potassium chloride)\\nThere are a small number of patients who develop a\\nrefractory type of celiac disease, where the GFD no\\nlonger seems effective. Once the diet has been thorough-\\nly assessed to ensure no hidden sources of gluten are\\ncausing the problem, medications may be prescribed.\\nSteroids or immunosuppressant drugs are often used to\\ntry to control the disease.\\nExpected results\\nThe physician will periodically recheck the level of\\nantibody in the patient’s blood after a diagnosis of celiac\\ndisease has been made. After several months on a GFD,\\nthe small intestine of the patient is biopsied again. If the\\ndiagnosis of celiac disease was correct, healing of the in-\\ntestine will be apparent. Most experts agree that it is nec-\\nessary to follow these steps in order to be sure of an ac-\\ncurate diagnosis.\\nPatients with celiac disease must keep a strict GFD\\nas long as they live. Although the disease may have\\nsymptom-free periods, silent damage will continue to\\noccur if the diet is not followed. Patients who do not fol-\\nlow their diets run higher risks of serious complications\\nlike gastrointestinal cancers, iron–deficiency anemia,\\nand decreased bone mineral density. Celiac disease can-\\nnot be “outgrown” or cured, according to medical au-\\nthorities.\\nOnce the diet has been followed for several years,\\nindividuals with celiac disease have similar mortality\\nrates to the general population.

H. Schussler, in the 1870s. Schussler studied\\ncremated human bodies, and found that these 12 sub-\\nstances made up the bulk of the remains. From this find-\\ning he theorized that these 12 so-called tissue salts are\\nresponsible for the harmonious functioning of the human\\norganism. Disease follows when a person becomes defi-\\ncient in any of the 12 salts. Schussler recommended that\\npatients take the salts in pill form to cure a variety of dis-\\norders. He believed that the salts provided adequate nu-\\ntrition to the cells. If cell nutrition was adequate, then\\ncell metabolism would be normal, and the body would\\nbe healthy. However, Schussler’s pills were not direct\\nnutritional supplements as we would understand them\\ntoday. He followed the principles of homeopathy, which\\nworks somewhat to the reverse of modern medicine, in\\nthat the smaller the dose, the more effective it is believed\\nto be. Cell salts are prepared like homeopathic medi-\\ncines, by a process of continued dilution and shaking or\\npounding (succussion).\\nBenefits\\nPractitioners of cell salt therapy believe the minerals\\nto be effective against a variety of ailments. For example,\\nCalcarea fluoris thought to be essential to vascular\\nhealth; it is given to patients with circulatory diseases or\\nsuch conditions as varicose veins , hemorrhoids , and\\nhardening of the arteries. Ferrum phos is used to treat\\ncolds, flu, and inflammation. Kali phos is used to treat\\nbody odor, as well as mental problems. Other salts treat\\nother disorders, from cramps to gout to skin problems.\\nSome are prescribed for general healing; that is, to re-\\nstore general health to a person without any overriding\\nspecific disease.\\nPreparations\\nCell salts may be derived from inorganic sources,\\nthough they can also be derived from plants. The salts are\\nmade into pills which are extremely dilute, following the\\nprinciples of homeopathy. The salts are crushed into fine\\nparticles, and the particles go through a series of dilu-\\ntions, then are molded into tablets. The patient does not\\nswallow the tablet, but allows it to dissolve on the tongue.\\nPrecautions\\nThough the cell salt pills are extremely dilute, prac-\\ntitioners believe them to be quite potent. Practitioners\\nadvise people to take cell salts only under the advice of a\\nhomeopathic physician. The cell salts are not intended to\\nbe a complete treatment, but only one part of a treatment\\nplan devised by a knowledgeable practitioner.\\nSide effects\\nBecause of the extremely dilute nature of cell salt\\npills, side effects are unlikely. Traditionally trained med-\\nical doctors would consider them placebos.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nCell salt therapy, like homeopathy, is not based on\\nscientific research but on provings. Provings are basical-\\nly anecdotal evidence gathered from volunteers. This\\nmethod of testing the efficacy of remedies was devised\\nby Samuel Hahnemann, the German physician who orig-\\ninated homeopathy. Within the field of homeopathy, cell\\nsalt therapy is considered a sister therapy or perhaps a\\nsubset of homeopathy. Homeopaths prescribe cell salts,\\nsometimes in conjunction with other remedies.\\nTraining & certification\\nCell salts are available as over-the-counter remedies,\\nand patients are able to treat themselves if they wish. An\\nunderstanding of cell salts can be gained from reading\\nSchussler’s work, or from comprehensive guides to home-\\nopathy. Cell salt therapy may be administered by a homeo-\\npathic doctor. Rules governing the practice of homeopathy\\nvary from state to state. Homeopaths in the United States\\ncan become certified through the Council for Homeopathic\\nCertification. This requires at least 500 hours of training in\\nhomeopathy through a school or seminars, plus a written\\nexamination. Certification is also offered to practitioners\\nwho have apprenticed for at least 2,000 hours with a certi-\\nfied homeopath. Other qualifications may also be neces-\\nsary, such as having taken a course in CPR (cardiopul-\\nmonary resuscitation) and human anatomy.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nCummings, Stephen, and Ullmann, Dana.

In\\n1667, at a laboratory in the palace of Louis XIV , Jean-\\nBaptiste Denis (1640–1704) attempted to transfuse\\nblood from a calf into a mentally ill patient—and since\\nblood transfusion is, in effect, a form of cell therapy, this\\ncould be the first documented case of this procedure.\\nHowever, the first recorded attempt at non-blood cellular\\ntherapy occurred in 1912 when German physicians at-\\ntempted to treat children with hypothyroidism , or an\\nunderactive thyroid, with thyroid cells.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 389\\nCell therapy\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nPlacebo—A pharmacologically inactive substance\\ngiven to placate a patient who supposes it to be a\\nmedicine.\\nSuccussion —A part of the process of making\\nhomeopathic remedies, in which the medicinal\\nsubstance is diluted in distilled water and then\\nshaken vigorously.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 389'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 408}, page_content='Cellulite\\nDefinition\\nCellulite is a popular term to describe fat deposits\\nunder the skin. It is characterized by a dimpled or or-\\nange-peel appearance due to structural changes under-\\nneath the skin’s top layer. Cellulite is a perfectly normal\\nand harmless condition, however, it is a cosmetic con-\\ncern of many people.\\nDescription\\nCellulite is a normal occurrence resulting from un-\\neven fatty deposits, mostly below the waistline. In\\nwomen, fat is arranged in large chambers underneath a\\nfairly thin layer of skin. These chambers are separated by\\ncolumns of collagen fibers. In obese (overweight) per-\\nsons, too much fat is being stuffed into these chambers,\\ncausing the pitting and bulging of the skin. In addition,\\nas women age, the fibers shrink and thicken, pulling the\\nskin downward. This results in a quilt-like appearance on\\nthe skin surface, especially in areas such as the buttocks,\\nthighs, or hips. Most women develop cellulite as they\\nage, regardless of their race. According to some studies,\\nas many as 95% of women over age 30 develop some\\nform of cellulite in their body.\\nFemale hormones (estrogen, and to a lesser extent,\\nprogesterone) play important roles in the formation of\\ncellulite. Estrogen stimulates the storage of fat, which is\\nneeded for menstruation , pregnancy, and lactation. In\\naddition, during the later phases of pregnancy, estrogen\\nalso causes the breakdown of collagen fibers to relax the\\ncervix, making it possible for a woman to deliver her\\nbaby. This collagen breakdown sets the stage for the for-\\nmation of cellulite. Progesterone may also contribute to\\nthe cellulite problem by weakening veins and causing\\nwater retention and weight gain.\\nCellulite is mostly a female problem. Due to differ-\\nent body physiques, men tend to have lower percentages\\nof body fat, while women have higher percentages. In\\naddition, men tend to accumulate fat in the abdominal\\narea while women have fat deposits mostly in the but-\\ntocks and thighs. Men have thicker skin and the cham-\\nbers are smaller and more tightly-held together. There-\\nfore, cellulite is not often found in men.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nMany scientists believe cellulite, as well as obesity,\\nis mostly predetermined by the genes that the persons\\ncarry. However, environmental as well as behavioral fac-\\ntors are also believed to have some effects on the devel-\\nopment of cellulite.\\nThe following factors are thought to contribute to\\nthe development of cellulite:\\n• Being overweight. Though cellulite also appears on\\nthin people, excess weight makes cellulite worse.\\n• Pregnancy. Cellulite problems get worse with each suc-\\ncessive pregnancy. During pregnancy, estrogen and\\nprogesterone levels are high. As a result, pregnant\\nwomen have increased fatty deposits, weight gain,\\nwater retention, and weakened fiber structure. The most\\neffective ways for women to get rid of body fat and cel-\\nlulite and get back to pre-pregnancy shape are breast-\\nfeeding and exercise.\\n• Aging. As women age, skin sags and wrinkles. In addi-\\ntion, the body‘s energy requirement lowers, thus, there\\nis more fat accumulation.\\n• Poor blood circulation. When there is impaired blood\\nflow to the fat-storage area, collagen fibers are dam-\\naged due to lack of oxygen and accumulation of toxic\\nwastes. The fibers shrink and thicken, resulting in the\\nquilted appearance of the fat chambers. In addition, be-\\ncause oxygen is needed to burn fat for energy, fat in\\nthese poorly oxygenated areas is the last to be used.\\nThis is also why cellulite is so difficult to eliminate.\\nPoor blood circulation is often caused by sedentary\\nlifestyles,smoking, and high caffeine consumption.\\n• Poor lymph drainage. The lymphatic system acts like a\\nsewage system, filtering out and carrying away cellular\\nwastes and toxins. If it is impaired, toxic products ac-\\ncumulate and inflate these fat cells, causing cellulite.\\n• Lack of exercise. Cellulite may be caused by impaired\\nblood circulation and poor muscle tone underneath the\\nskin, which are caused by sedentary lifestyles.\\n• High fat and sugar consumption. This often leads to ex-\\ncess caloric and fat intake, which causes increases in\\nbody fat and thus, cellulite.\\n• Food allergy. Food allergy causes a variety of symp-\\ntoms including food craving, weight gain, bloating and\\nwater retention, all of which worsen cellulite.\\n• Highly processed foods that contain preservatives, arti-\\nficial sweeteners and other additives. Heavy consump-\\ntion of prepackaged foods causes build up of these tox-\\nins in the body.\\n• Yo-yo dieting. Yo-yo dieting causes a woman to lose fat\\nin the upper body while increasing fat deposits in the\\nbuttocks, thighs, and hips. Therefore, this practice tends\\nto make cellulite problems worse than before dieting.\\n• Sun exposure. Prolonged exposure to the sun acceler-\\nates the skin-aging process.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2392\\nCellulite\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 392'),\n",

A person with CP is often also affected by other\\nconditions caused by brain damage.\\nDescription\\nThe affected muscles of a person with CP may be-\\ncome rigid or excessively loose. The person may lose\\ncontrol of muscles, or have problems with balance and\\ncoordination. A combination of these is also possible.\\nThose with CP may be primarily affected in the legs\\n(paraplegia or diplegia), or in the arm and leg of one side\\nof the body (hemiplegia), or all four limbs may be in-\\nvolved (quadriplegia).\\nA person with CP may also be affected by a number\\nof other problems, including a seizure disorder, visual\\ndeficits, hearing problems, mental retardation, learning\\ndisabilities, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disor-\\nder. None of these is necessarily part of CP, however,\\nthey may accompany the disorder.\\nproducts do not result in loss of body fat, as they often\\nclaim. At most, products such as Cellasene may be able\\nto make the dimpling from cellulite become less notice-\\nable. Further, when several ingredients are combined in\\nthese creams, it is difficult for investigators to determine\\nwhich ingredient might be responsible for any reduction\\nin the appearance of cellulite.\\nThe most effective treatment for cellulite remains\\ndiet and exercise. Adhering to a low-fat, high-fiber diet\\nand regular exercise will make the body as fit and trim as\\nit can be. These are long-term solutions that also provide\\nmany additional health benefits including prevention of\\nheart diseaseand cancer and slowing the aging process.\\nPrevention\\nCellulite is a normal occurrence in the human body\\nand predetermined by genetics. Some women will natu-\\nrally have more cellulite than others. However, diet and\\nexercise can keep the body fit and trim.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nThe Burton Goldberg Group. “Cellulite.”Alternative Medicine:\\nThe Definitive Guide.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 412}, page_content='CP affects approximately 500,000 children and\\nadults in the United States, and is diagnosed in more than\\n6,000 newborns and young children each year. It is not an\\ninherited disorder, and as of yet there is no way to predict\\nwith certainty which children will develop CP. It is not a\\ndisease, and is not communicable. CP is a nonprogressive\\ndisorder, which means that symptoms neither worsen nor\\nimprove over time. However manifestation of the symp-\\ntoms may become more severe over time. For example,\\nrigidity of muscles can lead to contractures and deformi-\\nties that require a variety of interventions.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses\\nCerebral palsy is caused by damage to the motor\\ncontrol centers of the brain. When the nerve cells (neu-\\nrons) in these regions die, the appropriate signals can no\\nlonger be sent to the muscles under their control. The re-\\nsulting poor control of these muscles causes the symp-\\ntoms of CP.\\nThe brain damage leading to CP may be caused by\\nlack of oxygen (asphyxia), infection, trauma, malnutrition,\\ndrugs or other chemicals, or hemorrhage. In most cases it\\nis impossible to determine the actual cause, although pre-\\nmature birth is recognized as a significant risk factor. It\\nwas once thought that difficult or prolonged delivery was\\nresponsible for many cases of CP, but most researchers\\nnow believe that the great majority of cases result from\\nbrain damage occurring before birth. The same injury that\\ndamages the motor areas can harm other areas as well,\\nleading to problems commonly associated with CP.\\nIf brain cells do not get enough oxygen because of\\npoor circulation, they may die. Defects in circulation in the\\ndeveloping brain may cause CP in some cases. Asphyxia\\nduring birth is also possible, and about half of newborns\\nknown to have suffered asphyxia during birth (perinatal as-\\nphyxia) develop CP. However, asphyxia during birth is\\nusually considered a symptom of an underlying neurologi-\\ncal problem in a newborn, rather than its cause, and the re-\\nsulting CP may be another sign of that problem. Asphyxia\\nafter birth can be caused by choking, poisoning (such as\\nfrom carbon monoxide or barbiturates), or near-drowning.\\nThe fetal brain may be damaged by an infection\\ncontracted by the mother. Infections correlated with CP\\ninclude rubella (German measles), toxoplasmosis (often\\ncontracted from cat feces), cytomegalovirus (a herpes\\nvirus), and HIV (the virus that causes AIDS). Encephali-\\ntis and meningitis, infections of the brain and its cover-\\nings, can also cause CP when contracted by infants.\\nPhysical trauma to the pregnant mother or infant\\nmay cause brain damage. Blows to the infant’s head, as\\nfrom a motor vehicle accident, violent shaking, or other\\nphysical abuse can damage the infant’s brain. Maternal\\nmalnutrition may cause brain damage, as can the use of\\ndrugs, including cocaine or alcohol. Although these fac-\\ntors may cause CP, they may be more likely to cause\\nmental retardation or other impairments.\\nIncompatibility between the Rh blood types of\\nmother and child was once a major cause of athetoid CP,\\none type of movement impairment seen in cerebral palsy.\\nIn some cases, this incompatibility can cause the moth-\\ner’s defense (immune) system to attack and destroy the\\nchild’s blood cells during pregnancy, a condition called\\nerythroblastosis fetalis. High levels of a blood cell break-\\ndown product called bilirubin in a child’s circulation,\\nleading to yellowish pigmentation of the skin caused by\\nbile (jaundice ) can result in brain damage. This condi-\\ntion is now rare because of testing procedures that identi-\\nfy potential Rh incompatibility, and treatment that pre-\\nvents the mother’s immune system from attacking the\\nchild’s blood cells. Jaundice that does occur can be treat-\\ned with special lights that help the breakdown of biliru-\\nbin. Blood transfusions for the child are also possible in\\nextreme cases. Despite the virtual elimination of this\\ncause of CP in the last few decades, CP rates have not\\ndeclined, largely because of the increase of survival of\\npremature babies.\\nPrematurity is one of the most significant risk fac-\\ntors for CP. About 7% of babies weighing less than three\\npounds at birth develop CP, and the risk increases dra-\\nmatically as weight falls. Prematurity may increase the\\nrisk of CP because of the increased likelihood of hemor-\\nrhaging in the brain associated with low birth weight.\\nBrain hemorrhage is most common in babies weighing\\nless than four pounds at birth, and the risk increases as\\nweight decreases. The hemorrhage may destroy brain tis-\\nsue, either through asphyxia or release of toxic break-\\ndown products.\\nResearchers in Sweden reported in 2002 that babies\\nconceived through in vitro fertilization (IVF) were 3.7\\ntimes more likely to have CP than babies conceived nat-\\nurally. Some of the reason can be attributed to a higher\\nrate of twins, low birthweight, and premature births as-\\nsociated with IVF babies, but some single births also\\nhave higher rates of CP.\\nSymptoms\\nThe symptoms of CP are usually not noticeable at\\nbirth. As children develop in the first 18 months of life,\\nhowever, they progress through a predictable set of de-\\nvelopmental milestones. Children with CP will develop\\nthese skills more slowly because of their motor impair-\\nments, and delay in reaching milestones is usually the\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2396\\nCerebral palsy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 396'),\n",

The more severe the CP, the earlier\\nthe diagnosis is usually made.\\nSelected developmental milestones, and the ages at\\nwhich a child will normally acquire them, are given\\nbelow. There is some cause for concern if the child does\\nnot acquire the skill by the age shown in parentheses:\\n• sits well unsupported, 6 months (8-10 months)\\n• babbles, 6 months (8 months)\\n• crawls, 9 months (12 months)\\n• finger feeds, holds bottle, 9 months (12 months)\\n• walks alone, 12 months (15-18 months)\\n• uses one or two words other than dada/mama, 12\\nmonths (15 months)\\n• walks up and down steps, 24 months (24-36 months)\\n• turns pages in books, removes shoes and socks, 24\\nmonths (30 months)\\nChildren do not consistently favor one hand over the\\nother before 18 months, and doing so may be a sign that\\nthe child has difficulty using the other hand. This same\\npreference for one side of the body may show up as an\\nasymmetric crawling effort, or continuing to use only\\none leg for the work of stair climbing after age three.\\nIt must be remembered that children normally\\nprogress at somewhat different rates, and slow initial ac-\\ncomplishment is often followed by normal development.\\nThere are also other causes for delay in reaching some\\nmilestones, including problems with vision or hearing.\\nBecause CP is a non-progressive disease, loss of previ-\\nously acquired milestones indicates that CP is not the\\ncause of the problem.\\nThe impairments of CP become recognizable in\\nearly childhood. The type of motor impairment and its\\nlocation are used as the basis for classification. There are\\nfive generally recognized types of impairment:\\n• Spastic. Muscles are rigid, posture may be abnormal,\\nand fine motor control is impaired.\\n• Athetoid. It is marked by slow, writhing, involuntary\\nmovements.\\n• Hypotonic. Muscles are floppy, without tone.\\n• Ataxic. Balance and coordination are impaired.\\n• Dystonic. Impairment is mixed.\\nThe location of the impairment usually falls into one\\nof three broad categories:\\n• Hemiplegia. One arm and one leg on the same side of\\nthe body are involved\\n• Diplegia. Both legs; arms may be partially involved.\\n• Quadriplegia. All four extremities are involved.\\nA person with CP may be said to have spastic diple-\\ngia, or ataxic hemiplegia, for instance. CP is also termed\\nmild, moderate, or severe, although these are subjective\\ncategories with no firm boundaries.\\nLoss of muscle control, especially of the spastic\\ntype, can cause serious orthopedic problems, including\\nscoliosis(spine curvature), hip dislocation, or contrac-\\ntures. Contracture is shortening of a muscle, caused by\\nan imbalance of opposing force from a neighboring mus-\\ncle. Contractures begin as prolonged contractions, but\\ncan become fixed or irreversible without regular range of\\nmotion exercises. A fixed contracture occurs when the\\ncontracted muscle adapts by reducing its overall length.\\nFixed contractures may cause postural abnormalities in\\nthe affected limbs, including clenched fists, tightly\\npressed or crossed thighs, or equinus. In equinus, the\\nmost common postural deformity, the foot is extended by\\nthe strong pull of the rear calf muscles, causing the toes\\nto point. The foot is commonly pulled inward as well, a\\ncondition called equinovarus. Contractures of all kinds\\nmay be painful, and may interfere with normal activities\\nof daily living, including hygiene and mobility.\\nAs noted, the brain damage that causes CP may also\\ncause a large number of other disorders. These may in-\\nclude:\\n• mental retardation\\n• learning disabilities\\n• attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\\n• seizure disorder\\n• visual impairment, especially strabismus (“cross-eye”)\\n• hearing loss\\n• speech impairment\\nThese problems may have an even greater impact on\\nthe child’s life than the physical impairment of CP, al-\\nthough not all children with CP are affected by other\\nproblems. About one-third of children with CP have\\nmoderate to severe mental retardation, one-third have\\nmild mental retardation, and one-third have normal to\\nabove average intelligence.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe tracking of developmental progress is the most\\nimportant test the physician has in determining whether\\na child has cerebral palsy. Most children with CP can be\\nconfidently diagnosed by 18 months. However, diagnos-\\ning CP is not always easy, since variations in child devel-\\nopment may account for delays in achieving milestones,\\nand since even children who are obviously delayed may\\ncontinue to progress through the various developmental\\nstages, attaining a normal range of skills later on.

Apgar scores of less than three out of a\\npossible 10 are associated with a highly increased indi-\\ncation of CP. Presence of abnormal muscle tone or\\nmovements may signal CP, as may the persistence of in-\\nfantile reflexes. A child with seizures or congenital organ\\nmalformation has an increased likelihood of CP. Ultra-\\nsound examination, a diagnostic technique that creates a\\ntwo-dimensional image of internal body structures, may\\nhelp to identify brain abnormalities, such as enlarged\\nventricles (chambers containing fluid) or periventricular\\nleukomalacia (an abnormality of the area surrounding\\nthe ventricles), which may be associated with CP.\\nX rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies,\\nand computed tomography (CT) scans are often used to\\nlook for scarring, cysts, expansion of the cerebral ventri-\\ncles (hydrocephalus), or other brain abnormalities that\\nmay indicate the cause of symptoms. Blood tests and ge-\\nnetic tests may be used to rule out other possible causes,\\nincluding muscular dystrophy (a disease characterized by\\nthe progressive wasting of muscles), mitochondrial (cel-\\nlular) disease, and other inherited disorders or infections.\\nTreatment\\nA number of people with cerebral palsy, both chil-\\ndren and adults, have found systematic relief and en-\\nhanced quality of life from a combination of alternative\\nand complementary treatments, including nutritional\\ntherapy,craniosacral therapy , bodywork, herbal thera-\\npy, homeopathy, and acupuncture.\\nGeneral recommendations\\nPregnant women should avoid cleaning cat litter, which\\nmay contain toxoplasma parasite. This organism causes se-\\nvere brain damage or death in the unborn fetus. Unprotected\\nsex increases risk of contracting sexually transmitted dis-\\neases such as genital herpes, which can infect the unborn\\nchild. Women should also vaccinate before getting pregnant\\nto prevent measles and rubella, which can cause severe brain\\ndamage to the fetus. They should avoid taking certain drugs,\\nsmoking, or drinking alcohol. Cocaine, heroine, nicotine\\nand alcohol are toxic to the developing brain of the fetus.\\nNutritional therapy\\nThe following dietary adjustments have been recom-\\nmended to alleviate some symptoms in patients with\\ncerebral palsy:\\n• Those with CP should avoid potential allergenic foods.\\nAllergic foods are believed to worsen symptoms in\\nmany CP patients.\\n• CP patients should also avoid preservatives and food ad-\\nditives such as MSG (which are potentially toxic to the\\nbrain) by eating fresh and unprocessed foods such as\\nwhole grains, vegetables, beans, fruits, nuts, and seeds.\\n• To improve muscle tone, CP patients should supplement\\ntheir diets with magnesium, thiamine, pyridoxine, vi-\\ntamin C , and bioflavonoids . Alternatively, they can\\ntake daily multivitamin/mineral supplements that can\\nprovide all these helpful nutrients and make sure they\\nare getting adequate protein in diet or supplements.\\nOsteopathy\\nCraniosacral therapy, a special form of osteopathic\\ntreatment, may be successful in preventing cerebral\\npalsy if performed right after a difficult labor or delivery\\nby forceps. This manipulation of bones of the newborn’s\\nskull may prevent stress and distortion of the child’s\\nhead occurring during traumatic delivery. Craniosacral\\ntherapy is less successful, however, in established cere-\\nbral palsy in an older child.\\nBodywork\\nBodywork such as massage, reflexology , Felden-\\nkrais, or rolfing can help improve blood circulation and\\nmuscle tone and reduce muscle spasms in patients with\\ncerebral palsy.\\nOther therapies\\nOther potentially helpful treatments include\\nacupuncture, homeopathy and herbal therapy, and dance\\nand music therapy. Although still not proven in clinical\\ntrials, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) has been used\\nto alleviate many symptoms of CP. It provides pure oxy-\\ngen at higher-tha-normal pressure in an enclosed cham-\\nber and is more commonly known for treating divers with\\ncompression sickness.

Support groups\\nfor parents of physically or mentally impaired children\\ncan be significant sources of both practical advice and\\nemotional support. Many cities have support groups that\\ncan be located through the United Cerebral Palsy Associ-\\nation or a local hospital or social service agency. Chil-\\ndren with CP are also eligible for special education ser-\\nvices. The diagnosing doctor should refer parents to the\\nlocal school district for these services. Even children\\naged birth to three years are eligible through early inter-\\nvention programs.\\nInfluence of CP on development\\nCerebral palsy may restrict a child’s ability to reach\\nfor and grasp objects, to move about, to explore the\\nproperties of toys, and to communicate with others,\\nwhich are all central activities in the child’s growth and\\ndevelopment. Therefore, the disease inhibits acquisition\\nof motor skills, knowledge of the world, and social com-\\npetence. The family can do much to overcome these re-\\nstrictions by adapting the child’s environment to meet his\\nor her needs and providing challenges within the child’s\\nabilities to accomplish. The advice and direction of an\\noccupational therapist can be critical to promoting nor-\\nmal development of the child with CP.\\nPosture and mobility\\nSpasticity, muscle coordination, ataxia, and scoliosis\\nare all significant impairments that affect the posture and\\nmobility of a person with cerebral palsy. Physical thera-\\npists work with the family to maximize the child’s ability\\nto move affected limbs, to develop normal motor pat-\\nterns, and to maintain posture. Adaptive equipment may\\nbe needed, including wheelchairs, walkers, shoe inserts,\\ncrutches, or braces. The need for adaptive equipment\\nmay change as the person develops, or as new treatments\\nare introduced.\\nSPASTICITY. Spasticity causes muscles to shorten,\\njoints to tighten, and postures to change. Spasticity can\\naffect the ability to walk, use a wheelchair, and sit unaid-\\ned; and it can prevent independent feeding, dressing, hy-\\ngiene, or other activities of daily living. Contracture and\\ndislocations are common consequences of spasticity.\\nMild spasticity may be treated by regular stretching\\nof the affected muscles through their full range of mo-\\ntion. This usually is done at least daily. Moderate spas-\\nticity may require bracing to keep a limb out of the ab-\\nnormal position, or serial casting to return it to its normal\\nposition. Ankle-foot braces (orthoses) made of light-\\nweight plastic are often used to increase a child’s stabili-\\nty and to promote proper joint alignment.\\nSpasticity may also be treated with muscle relaxing\\ndrugs, including diazepam (Valium), dantrolene\\n(Dantrium), and baclofen (Lioresal). A variety of ex-\\nperimental surgeries have been tried for people with\\ncerebral palsy to control spasticity. Most of these have\\nnot proven effective.\\nATAXIA AND COORDINATION Ataxia, or lack of\\nbalance control, is another factor affecting mobility.\\nPhysical therapy is an important tool to help the child\\nwith CP maximize balance. Coordination can be wors-\\nened if one member of a muscle pair is overly strong;\\nbracing or surgical transfer of the muscle to a less over-\\npowering position may help.\\nSCOLIOSIS. Scoliosis, or spine curvature, can devel-\\nop when the muscles that hold the spine in place become\\neither weak or spastic. This can cause pain, as well as in-\\nterfere with normal posture and internal organ function.\\nScoliosis may be treated with a trunk brace. If this proves\\nunsuccessful, spinal fusion surgery may be needed to join\\nthe vertebrae together, which keeps the spine straight.\\nSeizures\\nSeizures occur in 30-50% of children with CP.\\nSeizures may be treated with drugs, most commonly car-\\nbamazepine (Tegretol) or ethosuximide (Zarontin). A\\ncombination of a ketogenic diet and fasting may also be\\nused to control seizures. Although the need for anti-\\nseizure medication is temporary in some children, it may\\nbe required throughout life for others.\\nStrabismus\\nStrabismus, or squinting and lack of parallelism in\\nthe eyes, occurs in nearly half of all people with spastic\\nCP. Strabismus may be treated with patching and correc-\\ntive lenses. When these do not work, it may be treated\\nwith either surgery on the eye muscles causing the prob-\\nlem or by injection of botulinum toxin.\\nNutrition\\nDue to poor muscle coordination, CP children may\\nnot take in adequate nutrition for full growth and devel-\\nopment, worsening the results of the disorder. Careful at-\\ntention to nutritional needs and nutritional supplements\\nis required. Poor swallowing coordination may lead to\\naspiration, or inhaling of food or saliva.

Each of\\nthese can be prevented to some degree, either through\\nbehavioral changes alone or in combination with drug\\ntherapy. Constipation is more common as well, and may\\nbe treated through dietary changes, or with enemas or\\nsuppositories when necessary.\\nCommunication\\nPoor coordination of the tongue and mouth muscles\\ncan also affect speech.

A speech-language therapist can offer\\nvaluable advice on the types of equipment available.\\nEducation\\nThe best choice of school for the child with CP de-\\npends on the presence and degree of mental impairment\\nand physical impairment, as well as the facilities avail-\\nable in the area. “Inclusion,” or mainstreaming the child\\nin a regular public school classroom, may work well for\\nthe child with mild physical impairment. Separate class-\\nrooms or special schools may be needed for more se-\\nverely involved children. Schooling for disabled students\\nis governed by the Individuals with Disabilities Educa-\\ntion Act (IDEA) at the federal level and state special ed-\\nucation rules at the local level. An educational specialist\\nwithin the school system or from a community social\\nservices agency may be able to help the family navigate\\nthe various bureaucratic pathways that will ensure the\\nbest schooling available.\\nThe process of developing an educational plan for a\\nchild with CP begins with an assessment of the child’s\\nneeds. The assessment is carried out under state guide-\\nlines by a team of medical professionals. After the as-\\nsessment, the school district works with the parents and\\nothers involved in the child’s education and treatment to\\ndevelop an Individualized Educational Plan (IEP). The\\nIEP states the child’s specific needs for special instruc-\\ntion and indicates what services will be provided. The\\nspecial services may be as simple as allowing extra time\\nto travel between classes or as extensive as individual-\\nized instruction, adapted classroom equipment, and spe-\\ncial testing procedures. More information about assess-\\nments and IEPs is available through the National Infor-\\nmation Center for Children and Youth with Disabilities.\\nThe United Cerebral Palsy Assocation is another re-\\nsource for advocacy, information, and legal rights.\\nBehavioral and mental health services\\nThe child with CP may have behavioral problems or\\nemotional issues that affect psychological development\\nand social interactions. These may require special inter-\\nvention or treatment, including behavior modification\\nprograms or individual and family counseling. Attention-\\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder is common in children with\\nCP, and may require behavioral, educational, and med-\\nical intervention.\\nExpected results\\nCerebral palsy can affect every stage of maturation,\\nfrom childhood through adolescence to adulthood. At\\neach stage, the person with CP and his or her caregivers\\nmust strive to achieve and maintain the fullest range of\\nexperiences and education consistent with the person’s\\nabilities. The advice and intervention of professionals re-\\nmains crucial for many people with CP.\\nAlthough CP is not a terminal disorder, it can affect\\na person’s lifespan by increasing the risk of infection, es-\\npecially lung infections. Poor nutrition can contribute to\\nthe likelihood of infection. People with mild cerebral\\npalsy may have near-normal lifespans. The lifespan of\\nthose with more severe forms, especially spastic quadri-\\nplegia, is often considerably shortened. However, over\\n90% of infants with CP survive into adulthood.\\nIn 2002, a radical new method for repairing the\\ndamage caused by lack of oxygen at delivery of babies\\nwith CP was being funded for study. The possible treat-\\nment involved transplanting mature stem cells into ba-\\nbies’ circulations, which will then migrate to the site of\\ninjury caused by oxygen deprivation, hopefully promot-\\ning natural repair of the brain damage. However, this\\ntreatment was in very early stages of testing in animals\\nonly as of late 2002.\\nPrevention\\nThe cause of most cases of CP is unknown, but it\\nhas become clear in recent years that birth difficulties are\\nnot to blame in most cases.

Odle\\nCerebral vascular\\ninsufficiency\\nDefinition\\nCerebral vascular insufficiency is defined as insuffi-\\ncient blood flow to the brain. The most common cause of\\ndecreased blood flow is atherosclerosis of the arteries\\nthat supply blood to the brain.\\nDescription\\nCerebral vascular insufficiency is a common condi-\\ntion in the older population of developed countries due\\nto the high prevalence of atherosclerosis. The artery af-\\nfected in most cases of this disease is the carotid artery,\\nwhich carries most of the brain’s blood supply.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nA stroke, caused by reduced blood and oxygen sup-\\nply, may be an indication of severe blockage in the\\ncarotid artery. Less severe blockage may still cause\\n“mini-strokes” or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs),\\nwhich can cause symptoms of dizziness , ringing in the\\nears, blurred vision, and confusion. Any of these prob-\\nlems could indicate cerebral vascular insufficiency.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of cerebral vascular insufficiency is based\\nupon the presence of one or more of the following symp-\\ntoms:\\n• blurred vision\\n• depression\\n• vertigo (dizziness)\\n• headache\\n• lack of vigilance\\n• senility\\n• short-term memory loss\\n• ringing in the ears (tinnitus)\\nThe diagnosis is confirmed by using an ultrasound\\nexam to analyze blood flow to the brain.\\nTreatment\\nEDTA chelation therapy\\nEDTA (ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid) chela-\\ntion therapy involves intravenous or oral administration\\nof EDTA, a compound which pulls out plaque compo-\\nnents and helps to break it down. EDTA can improve\\nblood flow and relieve symptoms associated with athero-\\nsclerotic vascular disease. It may be necessary to take vi-\\ntamin and mineral supplements during EDTA therapy to\\navoid certain deficiencies, so a health practitioner should\\nbe consulted before beginning therapy, and a qualified\\nEDTA chelation specialist should be consulted for intra-\\nvenous therapy.\\nAortic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)\\nA natural medicine which can be helpful is an ex-\\ntract of aortic glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), a mixture\\nwhich is naturally present in the human aorta. Significant\\nimprovements in both symptoms of cerebral vascular in-\\nsufficiency and blood flow have been noted when aortic\\nGAGs are added to the diet. An effective dosage of aortic\\nGAGs is 100 mg daily and should be used for at least six\\nmonths after a stroke or TIA, after consultation with a\\nhealth practitioner.\\nGinkgo biloba\\nIn well-designed studies, ginkgo biloba (Ginkgo\\nbiloba) extract (GBE) has displayed an ability to reduce\\nmajor symptoms of cerebral vascular insufficiency, in-\\ncluding short-term memory loss, vertigo, headache, ring-\\ning in ears, lack of vigilance, and depression. A consulta-\\ntion with a practitioner or doctor is recommended before\\nbeginning a ginkgo biloba regimen.\\nProperties of GBE helpful for cerebral vascular in-\\nsufficiency:\\n• neutralizes free radicals\\n• makes blood more available in ischemic areas through\\ndilation\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2402\\nCerebral vascular insufficiency\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 402'),\n",

Improved\\ndiet and exercise can help a person’s long term outlook\\nfor this condition.\\nPrevention\\nMeasures taken to prevent hypertension and reduce\\ncholesterol and atherosclerosis will also help prevent\\ncerebral vascular insufficiency. Proper diet and lifestyle\\nmay not only protect against atherosclerosis, but may\\nalso reverse blockage in the arteries.

Coleus is a vasodilator,\\nan agent that widens or dilates blood vessels to allow\\nmore blood flow. The use of coleus as a treatment for\\nhigh blood pressure indicates its usefulness in cerebral\\nvascular insufficiency and resulting stroke. Its ability to\\nretard platelet activation and accumulation indicate that\\nit may be helpful in preventing atherosclerotic events.\\nSpinal manipulative therapy\\nIn one study, some patients receiving soft tissue\\ntherapy, trigger point therapy , postisometric relax-\\nation of spasmed muscles (a technique used for relax-\\nation of muscle tension), and spinal manipulation to par-\\ntially dislocated vertebrae experienced improvement of\\ncerebral vascular insufficiency symptoms such as verti-\\ngo,fatigue, and sleep disturbances, and improved cere-\\nbral circulation. However, patients who were initially di-\\nagnosed with an early form of cerebral vascular insuffi-\\nciency with vascular disturbances in the neck area or ver-\\ntebral artery syndrome had their symptoms worsen\\nduring manipulative treatment. A person with these diag-\\nnoses should not undergo spinal manipulation.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nVasodilators help to treat the symptoms of cerebral\\nvascular insufficiency and arteriosclerosis by increasing\\nthe blood flow in veins and arteries. Isoxsuprine is a va-\\nsodilator which relaxes blood vessels, making them\\nwider and allowing blood to flow through them more\\neasily. Other treatments which are becoming more com-\\nmon are carotid angioplasty (surgical repair of the arter-\\nies that pass up the neck and supply the head) and stent-\\ning.

McDade\\nCervical dysplasia\\nDefinition\\nCervical dysplasia is the existence of abnormal cells\\non the uterine cervix.\\nDescription\\nThe cervix is an organ in the female reproductive\\nsystem. It is narrow and located at the lower end of the\\nuterus. The cervix serves as a tubular passageway be-\\ntween the uterus and vagina. When a woman is pregnant,\\nthe cervix closes and seals off the uterus for the develop-\\ning fetus. During childbirth, the cervix expands to allow\\nthe baby to pass through. When a woman is not preg-\\nnant, the lining of the uterus passes through the cervix\\neach month during the menstrual cycle. The cervix also\\nsecretes mucus during ovulation, which assists in the fer-\\ntilization of the egg by sperm cells. Women can usually\\nfeel the cervix by inserting a finger toward the back of\\nthe vagina. The cervix resembles a small mound with a\\ndimple in the middle.\\nThe cervix has two types of cells. The outer part of\\nthe cervix near the vagina is covered with cells called\\nsquamous epithelial cells. The cervix canal is lined with\\nepithelial cells that secrete mucus during ovulation. The\\nborder between these two types of cells is called the\\ntransformation zone, which changes shape and position\\nwith age. Doctors may closely examine the transforma-\\ntion zone to watch for problems in both types of cells.\\nCervical dysplasia occurs when cells on the cervix\\nhave abnormalities. The condition is technically called\\ncervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) or squamous in-\\ntraepithelial lesions (SIL), depending on the affected\\ncells. The cervix is also susceptible to other problems,\\nincluding cervicitis (inflammation), sexually transmitted\\ndiseases (STDs),infections , and cancer (dysplasia is a\\nprecursor to cancer).\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe two factors that create the highest risks for cer-\\nvical dysplasia are smoking and sexual behavior. Cervi-\\ncal dysplasia is two to three times more likely to occur in\\nwomen who smoke than in those who do not. One study\\nshowed that the risk of dysplasia increases directly with\\nthe number of cigarettes a woman smokes per day. A\\nsecond study published in the late fall of 2002 showed\\nthat smokers infected with HPV had infections that last-\\ned longer and were more difficult to eradicate than\\nwomen who were infected but had never smoked. Nico-\\ntine, a toxin in cigarette smoke, can be found in the cer-\\nvical cells of smokers.\\nSexual behavior is another major risk factor. Studies\\nhave shown that the presence of sexually transmitted dis-\\neases are strongly correlated with the occurrence of cer-\\nvical dysplasia. Women who have human papillomavirus\\n(HPV), which causes genital warts , have higher occur-\\nrences of cervical dysplasia. Other STDs are believed to\\ninfluence cervical dysplasia as well, including herpes,\\nhepatitisB and C, and HIV . Risky behaviors for con-\\ntracting STDs and cervical dysplasia include having\\nmany sexual partners, having intercourse at a young age,\\nand having unprotected sex.\\nAs of late 2002, there is a clear need to educate\\nwomen more effectively about the link between human\\npapillomavirus infections and cervical cancer. A recent\\nstudy found that even women who understand the impor-\\ntance of early cervical cancer detection are much less\\nwell informed about the risk factors for cervical cancer.\\nOther factors that influence the development of cervi-\\ncal dysplasia are a high number of pregnancies; long-term\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2404\\nCervical dysplasia\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 404'),\n",

Folic acid\\ndeficiency is often observed with heavy alcohol consump-\\ntion, which may indirectly pose a risk as well, as may\\ndrug abuse. Cervical dysplasia has also been observed to\\nhave higher incidence in women in low income groups.\\nCervical dysplasia is generally asymptomatic, which\\nmeans that most women are not alerted to the condition\\nby detectable symptoms. To detect cervical dysplasia,\\nwomen must rely on diagnostic tests.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe most common method for diagnosing cervical\\ndysplasia is the Pap smear, which was invented by the\\nAmerican researcher George Papanicolaou in the 1950s.\\nDue to the effectiveness of the Pap smear in detecting\\ncervical problems, the incidence of cervical cancer has\\ndecreased by as much as 50% since 1960. Deaths from\\ncervical cancer have decreased by as much as 70% in\\ngroups of women who get frequent Pap tests.\\nThe Pap test is a simple procedure. A doctor inserts\\na small brush and obtains a sample of cervical cells that\\nare then analyzed under a microscope. Cell abnormali-\\nties, or cervical dysplasia, can be classified as low grade\\nor high grade, or ranked numerically. A Class 1 Pap re-\\nsult is normal, Class 5 represents cervical cancer, and the\\nnumbers in between indicate relative severity. It should\\nbe noted that the Pap smear is not perfectly accurate. In\\n20% or more of tests, the Pap smear can fail to find prob-\\nlems. The Pap smear may also overestimate the severity\\nof abnormalities. Thus, if dysplasia is found for the first\\ntime, it is a good idea to have follow-up Pap tests to con-\\nfirm the diagnosis. To increase the accuracy of Pap tests,\\nwomen should not douche or use a tampon for three days\\nbefore an exam, should abstain from intercourse for two\\ndays, and should allow a week after menstrual periods or\\nvaginal infections before having the exam performed.\\nSince women exposed to the HPV virus are also\\nmore susceptible to cervical dysplasia and cervical can-\\ncer, in 2002, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\npanel backed an HPV test as an accompaniment to the\\nPap smear. The test could help separate women at high\\nor low risk for cervical disease.\\nIf Pap tests continue to detect cervical dysplasia,\\nother diagnostic tests may be ordered. A cervigram is a\\nphotograph of the cervix that can be performed along-\\nside a Pap test. A colposcopy is a procedure in which a\\ntiny camera allows the physician to view the cervix and\\nthe interior of the vagina. If cancer or severe problems\\nare suspected after a colposcopy, a biopsy may be used,\\nin which tissue from the cervix, vagina, and uterus is sur-\\ngically removed in order to be analyzed. In a cone biop-\\nsy, a surgeon removes a cone-shaped section of the\\ncervix to check for cancerous cells. Cone biopsies can\\ncause permanent internal scarring, so women should\\ncarefully consider this procedure, particularly in cases\\nwhere dysplasia is not severe.\\nTreatment\\nThere are several alternative therapies that can be\\nutilized for cervical dysplasia. During and after alterna-\\ntive treatment, cervical dysplasia should still be moni-\\ntored by Pap smears from standard physicians, particu-\\nlarly for severe cases.\\nDietary and nutritional therapies seek to balance the\\nhormonal system and support the immune system. Diets\\nfor cervical dysplasia should be predominately vegetari-\\nan and low in fat, emphasizing fresh fruits, vegetables,\\ngrains, nuts, and legumes (beans and lentils). Alcohol,\\ncaffeine, fried foods, and sugar should be avoided, as\\nshould foods that may contain artificial hormones and\\nestrogen, such as dairy and meat products that are not or-\\nganically produced. Women should eat plenty of yellow\\nand leafy green vegetables. Tomatoes contain a sub-\\nstance called lycopene that may protect against dyspla-\\nsia. Soy products should also be frequently added to the\\ndiet for their estrogen balancing effects.\\nNutritional support includes the supplementation of\\nB-complex vitamins, particularly folic acid, vitamin B 6,\\nand vitamin B12. Vitamins A, C, and E are recommended,\\nas are the minerals selenium and zinc. Grape seed ex-\\ntract and pine bark extract are recommended antioxi-\\ndants to assist healing, and nutritional yeast and spiruli-\\nna are natural supplements for B vitamins and minerals.\\nRecommended herbs include vitex berries (also\\ncalled chasteberries, or chasteberry tree) and black co-\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 405'),\n",

Aromatherapy baths may also help, utiliz-\\ning the essential oils of geranium, rose, lavender, bitter\\norange, rosemary , or tea tree oil . Herbal douches and\\nherbal vaginal suppositories are available that utilize\\nherbs and essential oils to stimulate internal healing.\\nExercise is recommended to stimulate the immune\\nsystem and reduce stress. Yoga has exercises specifical-\\nly designed to stimulate circulation in the lower ab-\\ndomen and reproductive organs. Plenty of fresh air dur-\\ning the day is also beneficial for those trying to improve\\ntheir health and energy.\\nStress and emotional problems may also play a sig-\\nnificant role in cervical dysplasia and in problems with\\nthe reproductive system in general. Mind/body tech-\\nniques such as psychotherapy, meditation, progressive\\nrelaxation, breath work, and visualization may help re-\\nduce stress, remove emotional blockages, and stimulate\\nhealing. Detoxification therapies may also be recom-\\nmended, including fasting , sweating, and other tech-\\nniques, particularly for women who may have accumu-\\nlated toxins in the body from smoking, drug abuse, or\\npoor dietary and lifestyle habits.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nFor mild cases of cervical dysplasia, physicians may\\nchoose to monitor a patient with Pap smears every three\\nmonths, to determine if the condition can improve on its\\nown. For severe or chronic cases of dysplasia, allopathic\\ntreatment seeks to remove or destroy abnormal cells on\\nthe cervix. Cryosurgery destroys dysplastic cells by\\nfreezing them. Abnormal cervical cells can be burned off\\nwith a solution of trichloroacetic acid. Laser surgery may\\nalso be employed, as well as the loop electroexcision\\nprocedure (LOOP), a surgery in which a small wire loop\\nwith an electrical charge is used to destroy abnormal cer-\\nvical cells. Conventional surgery may be used for severe\\ncases of dysplasia. Women with high-risk HPV infection\\nare typically treated by conization, which is a procedure\\nin which the surgeon excises, or cuts out, a cone-shaped\\npiece of the cervix. Conization is reported to be about\\n73% effective in eliminating the HPV infection. Partial\\nhysterectomies remove the uterus and cervix.\\nExpected results\\nSeveral outcomes are possible with cervical dysplasia.\\nIn some cases, dysplasia may clear up completely without\\nmedical intervention. Some statistics have shown that\\nmoderate to severe cervical dyplasias (Class 3) improve on\\ntheir own in 50% of cases. Mild dysplasia may progress to\\nsevere dysplasia in up to 25% of cases. A 2002 study found\\nthat HIV-infected women were more likely than women\\nnot infected with HIV to have a recurrence of cervical dys-\\nplasia even after treatment for it. Hysterectomy was the\\nmost effective method to preventing recurrence.\\nAs of late 2002, there is still no completely satisfac-\\ntory treatment for cervical dysplasia associated with\\nHPV infection. None of the present therapies are 100%\\neffective in eradicating HPV infection.\\nCervical dysplasia does not directly progress to cer-\\nvical cancer, especially when it is detected early and\\ntreated. In some studies, cervical dysplasia progressed to\\ncervical cancer in approximately 15% of cases that were\\nnot diagnosed and treated properly. Cervical cancer is\\nthe second most common malignancy in women between\\nthe ages of 15 and 34; about 1% of cervical cancers\\noccur in pregnant or recently pregnant women. When de-\\ntected early by frequent Pap smears and other tests, how-\\never, cervical cancer is very treatable. One study estimat-\\ned that cervical cancer is fatal for 1 in 30,000 women.\\nPrevention\\nThe most important recent development related to\\nprevention of cervical dysplasia is the positive outcome of\\nclinical trials of a vaccine against HPV . According to an\\narticle published in the New England Journal of Medicine\\nin November 2002, a vaccine against HPV type 16 was ef-\\nfective in reducing the incidence of cervical dysplasia as\\nwell as HPV infection in the study subjects. Similar find-\\nings have been reported by Australian researchers.\\nUntil a vaccine against HPV is approved for general\\nuse, however, women should eliminate risky sexual be-\\nhaviors and should immediately quit smoking. Healthy\\ndietary and lifestyle habits should be adopted, and birth\\ncontrol pills should be avoided. Pap tests and gynecolog-\\nical exams should be performed once a year or more to\\nmonitor for recurring dysplasia. In fact, regular Pap tests\\nare critical to early detection of cervical disease. A 2002\\nreport by the College of American Pathologists said that\\nof those women who die of cervical cancer, 80 percent\\nhad not seen their doctors for a Pap test in the five years\\npreceding their diagnoses.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\n“Gynecologic Neoplasms.” Section 18, Chapter 241 in The\\nMerck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, edited by Mark\\nH.

Some esoteric sys-\\ntems include additional chakras, said to extend beyond the\\nphysical body into the human auric field. Each chakra is\\nbelieved to relate to particular organs of the body, ail-\\nments, colors, elements, and emotions. However, different\\nsystems or sources that use the idea of chakras may dis-\\nagree about the details. The concept of chakras plays a key\\nrole in two ancient Indian healing systems (ayurvedic\\nmedicine and yoga) that are popular today. In recent\\ndecades, however, many modern therapies (like polarity\\ntherapy, therapeutic touch, process acupressure, core\\nenergetics, and color therapy) have also incorporated the\\nidea of chakras into their own visions of healing.

These traditions were handed down orally\\nfor thousands of years before being codified by Patanjali\\nin his Yoga Sutras, several centuries before Christ.\\nAyurveda\\nThe ancient healing science of ayurveda is based on\\na collection of scriptures known as vedas (a Sanskrit\\nword meaning knowledge or wisdom). Ayurveda literally\\nmeans “life knowledge.” It remained the predominant\\nform of health care in India until the British colonial\\ngovernment tried to suppress it during the nineteenth\\ncentury. Over the last half-century, however, a modern-\\nized form of ayurveda has gained considerable populari-\\nty in India. More recently, traditional ayurveda has been\\npopularized in the West by such high-profile advocates\\nas Deepak Chopra.\\nBenefits\\nBalancing the chakras is believed to promote general\\nhealth and well-being by ensuring the free flow of life en-\\nergy (also known as prana or qi) throughout the body. It\\nis believed that blockages in the flow of this vital energy\\nwill eventually result in mental, emotional, and/or physi-\\ncal illness. By removing such blockages and maximizing\\nenergy flow, practitioners are said to enable body, mind,\\nand spirit to function optimally. Some alternative practi-\\ntioners, such as medical intuitives, say they can “read” a\\npatient’s chakras to detect imbalances and diagnose prob-\\nlems. This is also sometimes done using a pendulum.\\nDescription\\nYoga\\nJust as the various forms of yoga attempt to mediate\\nbetween the physical and spiritual realms, so the chakras\\nare believed to operate as energy transformers. They are\\noften shown as circles, spaced at intervals along the\\nspine, or sometimes as funnels of energy. Specific chants\\nor sounds associated with the different chakras are used\\nin some yogic meditation practices as tools for healing\\nand spiritual evolution.\\nEach of the seven chakras is said to have specific\\nphysiological and metaphysical functions that relate to\\nboth the nature of the associated blockages and to the\\nphysical problems they produce.\\n• Base/root chakra (muladhara). The first chakra, located\\nat the base of the spine, is linked with basic survival\\nand with the adrenal glands. It is associated with the\\ncolor red and the earth element.\\n• Second chakra (svadisthana). Thought to reside in the\\ngenital region, this chakra is linked with sexuality and\\nwith the reproductive system. It is associated with the\\ncolor orange and the water element.\\n• Third chakra (manipura). Situated near the navel, this\\nchakra is linked with the pancreas and the solar plexus.\\nIt is associated with the color yellow, the fire element,\\nand power in the world.\\n• Heart chakra (cnahata). The fourth chakra, associated\\nwith the heart and the immune system, is believed to be\\nthe seat of love and compassion. It is associated with\\nthe color green and the air element.\\n• Throat chakra (visuddha). The fifth chakra, situated in\\nthe throat area, is associated with the thyroid gland, the\\ncolor blue, and communication.\\n• Brow/forehead chakra (ajna). The sixth chakra, also\\nknown as the “Third Eye,” is said to reside in the fore-\\nhead. It is associated with hormonal production, the\\ncolor indigo, and intuition.\\n• Crown chakra (saha srara). The seventh chakra, located\\nat the top of the skull, is associated with elevated spiritu-\\nal consciousness, the pineal gland, and the color violet.\\nPrecautions\\nIn recent decades, yoga has gained widespread ac-\\nceptance in the West as a tool for relaxation , stress re-\\nduction, increased flexibility and energy.

It has become\\nabundant in the United States, where it has escaped culti-\\nvation to grow freely in pastures, cornfields, roadsides,\\nand other sunny, well-drained areas. The generic name,\\nchamomile, is derived from the Greek,khamai, meaning\\n“on the ground,” and melon, meaning “apple.” The offi-\\ncial medicinal chamomile is the German chamomile Ma-\\ntricaria recutita. Chamomile was revered as one of nine\\nsacred herbs by the ancient Saxons. The Egyptians val-\\nued the herb as a cure for malaria and dedicated\\nchamommile to their sun god, Ra. Two species of this\\nsweet-scented plant, Roman chamomile and German\\nchamomile, have been called the true chamomile be-\\ncause of their similar appearance and medicinal uses.\\nRoman chamomile Chamaemelum nobile is a mem-\\nber of the Asteraceae, or daisy family. It is a hardy, low-\\ngrowing, perennial. Because of the creeping roots and\\ncompact, mat-like growth of this species it is sometimes\\ncalled lawn chamomile. Roman chamomile releases a\\npleasant, apple scent when walked upon. It was used as a\\nstrewing herb during the middle ages to scent the floors\\nand passageways in the home and to deter insects. The\\nSpanish call the herb manzanilla, or “little apple.” This\\nfragrant evergreen is a garden favorite. It is also called the\\nphysician herb because of its beneficial effect on other\\nherbs as a companion in the garden. Blossoms grow\\nsingly on long stalks attached to the erect, branching,\\nhairy stems. The tiny, daisy-like flowers, blooming May to\\nSeptember, have a small yellow solid cone surrounded by\\nwhite rays. The leaves are twice divided and have a feath-\\nery appearance. They are light green, and somewhat shiny.\\nGerman chamomile Matricaria recutita , or Cham-\\nomilla recutita is a hardy, self-seeding annual herb. It has\\nlong been cultivated in Germany to maximize its medici-\\nnal properties. The hollow, bright gold cone of the blos-\\nsom is ringed with numerous white rays. The herb has\\nalso been called scented mayweed, and Balder’s eyelash-\\nes, after Balder, the Norse God of Light. German\\nchamomile is also a sprawling member of the Asteraceae\\nfamily, as it closely resembles the Roman chamomile.\\nDyer’s chamomile Anthemis tinctora, also known as\\nyellow chamomile, or golden marquerite, is valued for its\\nuse primarily as a dye plant. This native of southern and\\ncentral Europe is also found in Britain and North America,\\nwhere it grows wild in many places. It closely resembles the\\nother species, but does not have the medicinal properties of\\nRoman and German chamomile. This species may be bien-\\nnial or perennial. Both the disk and the rays of the blossom\\nare golden yellow, yielding a distinctive dye that varies\\nfrom a bright yellow to a more brownish-yellow tint. The\\ntype of mordant used influences the color produced. Dyer’s\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 409'),\n",

The branched stems are erect and\\nwoolly, with leaves that can grow to three inches long.\\nGeneral use\\nThe aromatic flower heads and herba (leaves) of\\nboth Roman and German chamomile are used medicinal-\\nly. They are highly scented with volatile, aromatic oil,\\nincluding the heat-sensitive Azulene, which is the blue\\nchamomile essential oil. The phytochemical constituents\\nin chamomile also include flavonoids, coumarins, plant\\nacids, fatty acids, cyanogenic glycosides, choline, tan-\\nnin, and salicylate derivatives. This bittersweet herb acts\\nmedicinally as a tonic, anodyne, antispasmodic, anti-in-\\nflammatory, antibacterial, anti-allergenic, and sedative.\\nTraditionally, a mild infusion of the herb has been safely\\nused to calm restless children, and to ease colic and\\nteething pain in babies. It is also effective in relieving\\nacid indigestion and abdominal pain. Its carminative\\nproperties relieve intestinal gas, and it helps in cases of\\ndiarrhea , constipation , and peptic ulcers. The herbal\\ntea can ease symptoms of colds and flu by relieving\\nheadacheand reducing fever. The infusion is also help-\\nful to treat toothache , arthritis, gout, and premenstrual\\ntension. It may also be used in douche preparations, or\\nsitz baths. As an external wash in strong infusion, or de-\\ncoction, or as part of a hot compress, the herb can soothe\\nburnsand scalds, skin rashes, and sores. Chamomile\\ncan be used in a douche, as a gargle for mouth ulcers, as\\na soothing eye wash for conjunctivitis , and as a hair\\nrinse to brighten the hair. Chamomile blossoms may also\\nbe used as an herbal aromatic treatment, providing a\\ntonic lift with its pleasing scent. This use of chamomile\\nis especially popular among Hispanics living in the\\nsouthwestern United States, who use the herb at signifi-\\ncantly higher levels than the rest of the population.\\nPreparations\\nChamomile is most often prepared as an infusion of\\nthe blossoms of German chamomile, and less commonly\\nof Roman chamomile. Traditionally the tiny blossoms\\nare picked on midsummers’ eve. The best time to harvest\\nis on a sunny day when the mass of blossoms is at its\\nfullness in the morning. Harvesting chamomile blossoms\\ncan be painstaking work, requiring a gardner’s best pa-\\ntience. Pinch off the flower head, leaving the stem. Fresh\\nor dried blossoms may be used in herbal preparations.\\nBlossoms to be dried for storage should be spread\\nsingly on a screen or mat and placed in a well-ventilated\\nplace, out of direct sun, with a temperature close to 95°F\\n(35°C). The rapid drying will preserve much of the\\nvolatile oil and other medicinal properties. A few blos-\\nsoms go a long way with this pleasant and safe herbal\\nally. Store dried blossoms in tightly sealed, glass con-\\ntainers, away from light. They will maintain potency for\\nabout one year. Chamomile is prolific, and the plant\\nblossoms frequently throughout the summer. Sometimes\\ntwo or three harvests can be made in one season.\\nChamomile tea may be made from an infusion of\\nblossoms prepared as a tisane, for a single, soothing cup,\\nor in a larger quantity for use throughout the day.\\nChamomile combines well with mints, such as lemon\\nbalm (Melissa officinalis) or spearmint (Mentha spica-\\nta), combined in equal quantity. For a tisane, use 1 tsp of\\ndried blossoms, or 1.5 tsp of freshly picked flowers in a\\nwarm cup. Heat water to the boiling point and pour over\\nthe blossoms in glass container. Cover, and infuse for\\n3–5 minutes. Let strain. Be careful not to oversteep\\nchamomile, lest it lose its delicate flavor to a bitter edge.\\nStandard dose is up to three cups per day. The prepared\\ntea will keep for a day or two in the refrigerator.\\nTo prepare a chamomile decoction, which is a stronger\\npreparation, let the plant parts steep in a covered nonmetal-\\nlic pot for at least ten minutes. The decoction may be used\\nas a skin wash, hair rinse, mouth wash, or to bathe wounds.\\nAn extract of the essential oil can be prepared by\\nplacing 2 oz (57 g) of fresh blossoms into a glass con-\\ntainer and covering the plant with 0.5–1 pt (0.24–0.47 l)\\nof olive oil. Place the mixture on a sunny window sill for\\nabout one week. Strain and store in a dark container with\\na tight-fitting lid. The oil remains potent for up to one\\nyear. It is best when applied warm.\\nPrecautions\\nChamomile has been used over the centuries and is\\ngenerally considered a safe and gentle herbal rememdy\\nthat may be used daily as a calming tea. Persons who\\nmay be allergic to such pollen-bearing plants as\\nchamomile would be wise to experiment with this herbal\\nremedy with some caution.\\nSide effects\\nThe moderate internal use of chamomile prepara-\\ntions has no known side effects; however, some herbal-\\nists warn that the herb, when taken internally in exces-\\nsive doses, can induce vomiting and produce vertigo\\n(dizziness ). With regard to the external use of\\nchamomile preparations, a small number of persons ex-\\nperience mild skin irritation.\\nInteractions\\nThere are no contraindications for using this gentle,\\nhealing herb.

However, charcoal\\nwas almost forgotten until 15 years ago when it was re-\\ndiscovered as a wonderful oral agent to treat most over-\\ndoses and toxins.\\nGeneral use\\nActivated charcoal’s most important use is for treat-\\nment of poisoning. It helps prevent the absorption of\\nmost poisons or drugs by the stomach and intestines. In\\naddition to being used for most swallowed poisons in hu-\\nmans, charcoal has been effectively used in dogs, rabbits,\\nrats and other animals, as well. It can also absorb gas in\\nthe bowels and has been used for the treatment of gas or\\ndiarrhea. Charcoal’s other uses such as treatment of\\nviruses, bacteria, bacterial toxic byproducts, snake ven-\\noms and other substances by adsorption have not been\\nsupported by clinical studies.

Activated char-\\ncoal is one of the agents most commonly used for infants\\nand toddlers. It can absorb large amounts of poisons\\nquickly. In addition, it is non-toxic, may be stored for a\\nlong time, and can be conveniently administered at\\nhome. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxic\\nsubstances in the stomach and intestines. This prevents\\nthe toxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout\\nthe body. The activated charcoal with the toxic substance\\nbound to it is then excreted in the stool without harm to\\nthe body.\\nWhen poisoning is suspected the local poison con-\\ntrol center should be contacted for instructions. They\\nmay recommend using activated charcoal, which should\\nbe available at home so that it can be given to the poi-\\nsoned child or pet immediately. For severe poisoning,\\nseveral doses of activated charcoal may be needed. A\\n2002 study showed that in some cases, charcoal could be\\nadministered at home sooner than in the emergency\\nroom, and was beneficial for children who had ingested\\npoisonous mushrooms. However, the study concluded\\nthat more research was needed to be sure that home-ad-\\nministered doses were accurate and the best solution for\\nother types of poisoning.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGladstar, Rosemary.

Even before the discovery of America by Euro-\\npeans, Native Americans used powdered charcoal mixed\\nwith water to treat an upset stomach. Now charcoal is\\nbeing rediscovered as an alternative treatment for this\\ncondition. Activated charcoal works like a sponge. Its\\nhuge surface area is ideal for soaking up different sub-\\nstances, including gas. In one study, people taking acti-\\nvated charcoal after eating a meal with high gas-produc-\\ning foods did not produce more gas than those who did\\nnot have these foods. Charcoal has also been used to\\ntreat other intestinal disorders such as diarrhea,consti-\\npation, and cramps. There are few studies to support\\nthese uses and there are also concerns that frequent use\\nof charcoal may decrease absorption of essential nutri-\\nents, especially in children.\\nOther uses\\nBesides being a general antidote for poisons or rem-\\nedy for gas, activated charcoal has been used to treat\\nother conditions as well. Based on its ability to adsorb or\\nbind to other substances, charcoal has been effectively\\nused to clean skin wounds and to adsorb waste materials\\nfrom the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, it has been\\nused to adsorb snake venoms, viruses, bacteria, and\\nharmful materials excreted by bacteria or fungi. Howev-\\ner, because of lack of scientific studies, these uses are\\nnot recommended. Activated charcoal, when used to-\\ngether with other remedies such as aloe vera, aci-\\ndophilus, and psyllium, helps to keep symptoms of ul-\\ncerative colitis under control. While charcoal shows\\nsome anti-aging activity in rats, it is doubtful if it can do\\nthe same for humans.\\nPreparations\\nFor poisoning\\nActivated charcoal is available without prescription.\\nHowever, in case of accidental poisoning or drug over-\\ndose an emergency poison control center, hospital emer-\\ngency room, or doctor’s office should be called for ad-\\nvice. In cases where both syrup of ipecac and charcoal\\nare recommended for treatment of the poison, ipecac\\nshould be given first. Charcoal should not be given for at\\nleast 30 minutes after ipecac or until vomiting from\\nipecac stops. Activated charcoal is often mixed with a\\nliquid before being swallowed or put into the tube lead-\\ning to the stomach. Activated charcoal is available as 30-\\ngram liquid bottles. It is also available in 15-gram con-\\ntainer sizes and as slurry of charcoal pre-mixed in water\\nor as a container in which water or soda pop is added.\\nKeeping activated charcoal at home is a good idea so that\\nit can be taken immediately when needed for treatment\\nof poisoning.\\nFor acute poisoning, the dosage is as follows:\\n• infants (under 1 year of age): 1 g/kg\\n• children (1-12 years of age): 15-30 g or 1-2 g/kg with\\nat least 8 oz of water\\n• adults: 30-100 g or 1-2 g/kg with at least 8 oz of water\\nFor diarrhea or gas\\nA person can take charcoal tablets or capsules with\\nwater or sprinkle the content onto foods. The dosage for\\ntreatment of gas or diarrhea in adults is 520-975 mg after\\neach meal and up to 5 g per day.\\nPrecautions\\nParents should keep activated charcoal on hand in\\ncase of emergencies.\\nCharcoal should not be taken together with syrup of\\nipecac, as the charcoal will adsorb the ipecac. Charcoal\\nshould be taken 30 minutes after ipecac or after the vom-\\niting from ipecac stops.\\nSome activated charcoal products contain sorbitol.\\nSorbitol is a sweetener as well as a laxative, therefore, it\\nmay cause severe diarrhea and vomiting. These products\\nshould not be used in infants.\\nCharcoal may interfere with the absorption of med-\\nications and nutrients such as vitamins or minerals. For\\nuses other than for treatment of poisoning, charcoal\\nshould be taken two hours after other medications.\\nCharcoal should not be used to treat poisoning\\ncaused by corrosive products such as lye or other strong\\nacids or petroleum products such as gasoline, kerosene,\\nor cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the condition\\nworse and delay diagnosis and treatment. In addition,\\ncharcoal is also not effective if the poison is lithium,\\ncyanide,iron, ethanol, or methanol.\\nParents should not mix charcoal with chocolate\\nsyrup, sherbet, or ice cream, even though it may make\\ncharcoal taste better.

In\\nthe efficacy part of the study, 77.1% of subjects taking\\nvitex reported improvement in their symptoms, as\\nagainst only 60.6% in the pyridoxine group.\\nSome studies show that chasteberry can both increase\\nand decrease prolactin levels in the body. Too much pro-\\nlactin is related to amenorrhea (no menstrual periods) and\\nbreast tenderness associated with PMS; too little prolactin\\ncan mean reduced milk production. In one study featuring\\n100 nursing mothers, those who took chasteberry had\\nmore milk than those who took a placebo. In another clini-\\ncal study of PMS associated with high prolactin levels,\\nvitex balanced not only prolactin levels but the menstrual\\ncycle itself. According to David L. Hoffman, taking vitex\\nafter stopping birth control pills can regulate cycles and\\ntherefore increase the likelihood of pregnancy. Another\\nwriter has described her own situation of stopping birth\\ncontrol pills and having no periods for two and a half\\nyears until she started taking chasteberry. German studies\\nalso show that vitex may also help prevent a miscarriage.\\nChasteberry is also used to treat fibroid cysts, espe-\\ncially cysts in smooth muscle. Vitex has been said to be\\neffective in stopping the heavy bleeding of peri-\\nmenopause and reduce the hot flashes in menopause it-\\nself. It is used extensively in England for this purpose.\\nAlso, chasteberry’s antiandrogenic influence can help to\\nreduce acne in teenagers of either sex.\\nPreparations\\nChasteberry may be taken as a tincture, an extract, a\\ntea or in capsules. The usual dosage is 200 mg of the\\nberry, with a standardized amount (0.5%) of the active\\ningredient agnuside. The recommended dosage varies\\nwith the ailment being treated, and should be decided\\nupon in conjunction with a health care practitioner.\\nTincture and extracts of chasteberry are mixed with\\nwater or juice, 10–30 drops per drink. They should be\\ntaken up to three times daily.\\nChasteberry tea is made from 1 tsp of ripe berries to\\n1 cup (250 ml) of boiling water. The tea must be steeped\\nfor 10–15 min and should be drunk three times daily.\\nAccording to one naturopathic physician, the usual\\ndosage of extract of chasteberry is 175–225 mg on a\\ndaily basis. Capsules are available in doses from 40–400\\nmg. The capsules are usually taken one to three a day\\nabout one hour before breakfast to increase their absorp-\\ntion. If taken before bedtime, chasteberry may aid in\\nsleeping as well as increasing the secretion of melatonin\\nin the early morning. Because chasteberry acts slowly in\\nthe body, it can take from one to six months to see per-\\nmanent results. These results should continue even after\\ndiscontinuing taking chasteberry. To increase milk pro-\\nduction, women are advised to take chasteberry the first\\n10 days after giving birth.\\nChasteberry may be taken in conjunction with Vita-\\nmin B6 for PMS.\\nPrecautions\\nSome practitioners of alternative medicine recom-\\nmend that pregnant women should abstain from taking\\nchasteberry. German research indicates that chasteberry is\\nsafe for the first three months of pregnancy, but is unsafe\\nafter that time as it might start the flow of milk too early.\\nHerbal experts may also advise patients with breast\\ncancer, uterine cancer , or pituitary tumors not to take\\nchasteberry. It is always best to check with your health\\ncare provider first.\\nBecause chasteberry does not contain plant estro-\\ngens, it should not be used as a substitute for hormonal\\nreplacement therapy, or HRT. Women who are concerned\\nabout the possible side effects of HRT should consider\\nfo-ti or other herbs shown to have measurable estrogen-\\nlike activity, such as licorice and hops.\\nSide effects\\nChasteberry rarely has side effects but a few have\\nbeen reported: allergic rashes; minor headaches and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2414\\nChasteberry tree\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 414'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 432}, page_content='General use\\nThe importance of minerals\\nMinerals are vital to health because they are the\\nbuilding blocks that make up muscles, tissues, and\\nbones. They also are important components of many life-\\nsupporting systems and activities, and are important to\\nhormones, oxygen transport, and enzyme systems.\\nMinerals participate in the chemical reactions that\\noccur inside the body. These nutrients may work as co-\\nfactors or helpers. As cofactors, minerals help enzymes\\nfunction properly. Minerals may also work as catalysts to\\ninitiate and speed up these enzymatic reactions.\\nMinerals are the electrolytes that the body needs to\\nmaintain normal body fluids and the acid-base balance.\\nAs electrolytes, minerals act as stop gates to control\\nnerve signal movements throughout the body. Because\\nnerves control muscle movements, minerals also regulate\\nmuscle contraction and relaxation.\\nMany minerals such as zinc, copper, selenium, and\\nmanganese act as antioxidants . They protect the body\\nagainst the damaging effects of free radicals (reactive\\nmolecules). They scavenge or mop up these highly reac-\\ntive radicals and change them into inactive, less harmful\\ncompounds. In so doing, these minerals help prevent\\ncancerand many other degenerative diseases such as\\npremature aging, heart disease , autoimmune diseases,\\narthritis, cataracts, Alzheimer’s disease, and diabetes.\\nThere are two kinds of minerals: the major (or\\nmacro) minerals and the trace minerals. Major minerals\\nare the minerals that the body needs in large amounts.\\nThe following minerals are classified as major:calcium,\\nphosphorus , magnesium, sodium, potassium, sulfur,\\nand chloride. They are needed to build muscles, blood,\\nnerve cells, teeth, and bones. They are also essential\\nelectrolytes that the body requires to regulate blood vol-\\nume and the acid-base balance.\\nUnlike the major minerals, trace minerals are need-\\ned only in tiny amounts. Even though they can be found\\nin the body in exceedingly small amounts, they are also\\nvery important. These minerals participate in most\\nchemical reactions in the body. They are also needed to\\nmanufacture important hormones. The following are\\nclassified as trace minerals:iron, zinc, iodine, copper,\\nmanganese, fluoride, chromium , selenium, molybde-\\nnum, and boron.\\nWhy supplements are used\\nRecent studies have shown that mineral supplements\\nare needed because most Americans don’t get adequate\\namounts of minerals in their diets. More and more peo-\\nple now take chelated minerals daily to ensure that the\\nbody has enough of these nutrients to function properly.\\nMany healthy people take minerals to boost their body’s\\nimmune system and to achieve maximal levels of energy\\nand mental alertness.\\nTreatment and prevention of diseases\\nPeople take individual minerals to prevent or treat\\ncertain diseases and conditions. The following are the\\nbenefits/uses of key minerals and the optimum daily in-\\ntake (ODI) of each mineral. ODI is the amount most\\npeople require to function at their best level.\\nCALCIUM (ODI = 1,000–1,500 MG). Calcium supple-\\nments are commonly used for the prevention and treat-\\nment of osteoporosis (a bone thinning disease). Howev-\\ner, calcium supplements also provide other benefits as\\nwell. Studies have shown that calcium may also be effec-\\ntive in treating high blood pressure and relieving symp-\\ntoms of leg cramps and arthritis. It may also prevent\\ncolon cancer.\\nCalcium supplements may be contaminated with\\nlead, which is highly toxic. A study by the Department\\nof Environmental Toxicology, University of California,\\nSanta Cruz, indicates that for calcium supplements,\\nchelation may be a bad idea. They found that non-chelat-\\ned calcium supplements had lower levels of lead contam-\\nination than the chelated products.\\nPHOSPHORUS (ODI = 200–400 MG). Phosphorus is\\nan important mineral in our body. However, because\\nAmericans often exceed their phosphorus requirements\\ndue to high consumption of sodas and meat, phosphorus\\nsupplements are neither necessary nor recommended.\\nExcessive consumption of phosphorus accelerates bone\\nloss leading to osteoporosis.\\nMAGNESIUM (ODI = 500–750 MG). Magnesium sup-\\nplements have been used to promote healthy teeth and\\nbones, treat muscle spasms, relieve premenstrual pain,\\nand lower high blood pressure in patients with low mag-\\nnesium levels. Magnesium has also been used to prevent\\npremature labor and low birth weight.\\nZINC (ODI = 22.5–50 MG). Zinc is one of the most\\nfrequently used supplements. A strong antioxidant, zinc\\nprotects the body against damaging free radicals and\\nboosts the body’s immune system. It helps heal burns\\nand wounds, offers some protection against common in-\\nfections such as colds or flu, and helps prevent cancer. It\\nmay be effective in the prevention and/or treatment of\\nage-related macular degeneration (an eye disease), in-\\nfertility , hair loss , anorexia nervosa (an eating disor-\\nder), prostate enlargement, and common skin problems\\nlike acne.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2416\\nChelated minerals\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 416'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 433}, page_content='IRON (ODI = 15–25 MG FOR MEN; 18–30 MG FOR\\nWOMEN) Iron supplements are most often prescribed to\\ntreat iron deficiency anemia. Iron is also used to in-\\ncrease energy and mental sharpness.\\nCOPPER (ODI = 0.5–2 MG). Copper deficiency is rel-\\natively rare due to the abundance of it in natural food\\nsources and in drinking water. Because of the potential\\nrisk of severe toxicity, copper is best taken as part of a\\nmultivitamin-mineral formula.\\nMANGANESE (ODI = 15–30 MG). Supplements of\\nthis trace mineral have been used to prevent cancer, to\\nimprove blood sugar control, and to treat arthritic symp-\\ntoms.\\nCHROMIUM (ODI = 200–600 MICROGRAMS OR\\nMCG). This trace mineral may help prevent or treat low\\nblood sugar levels and diabetes. It may also offer protec-\\ntion against heart disease by lowering blood cholesterol\\nlevels.\\nSELENIUM (ODI = 50–400 MCG). A good antioxi-\\ndant, selenium may help protect the body against cancer,\\npremature aging, and degenerative diseases such as heart\\ndisease and arthritis.\\nIODINE (ODI = UP TO 150 MCG). Iodine is some-\\ntimes used to prevent goiter, an iodine deficiency dis-\\nease.\\nPOTASSIUM (ODI = 99–300 MG). Potassium supple-\\nments are most often prescribed to treat potassium defi-\\nciency caused by chronic diuretic use. Diuretics are\\nproducts that make the body eliminate more urine.\\nBORON. There is no ODI for boron; however, 3–6\\nmg of boron may be helpful in preventing osteoporosis\\nand improving symptoms of osteoarthritis.\\nPrevention of drug-induced side effects\\nMineral supplements are used to prevent drug-in-\\nduced mineral deficiencies. A mineral deficiency some-\\ntimes occurs after prolonged use of certain drugs. For ex-\\nample, patients who receive diuretics such as hy-\\ndrochlorothiazide or furosemide for high blood pressure\\noften have low potassium levels. The condition is so\\ncommon that doctors routinely prescribe potassium sup-\\nplements together with diuretics. Because high potassi-\\num levels are toxic to the body, patients shouldn’t take\\nmore potassium than the doctor has ordered.\\nPreparations\\nOne major problem associated with mineral supple-\\nments has been poor absorption. Traditional forms of\\nmineral supplements, the mineral salts, are very inexpen-\\nsive. However, they don’t absorb well into the body.\\nMost of the minerals contained in these tablets pass right\\nthrough the body and aren’t absorbed into the blood.\\nChelation has been used as a means of improving ab-\\nsorption of minerals from supplements, but the value of\\nthis method is limited at best. Generally, chelated miner-\\nals are not absorbed more than 5% more effectively than\\nunchelated supplements. This minor benefit rarely justi-\\nfies the higher prices charged for chelated products. The\\npoor absorption of minerals is taken into account when\\nthe daily diet recommendations are developed, so that the\\nrecommended intake should be enough of the mineral to\\nprovide the levels that are actually desired.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople should remember several guidelines when\\nusing chelated mineral supplements.\\n• Mineral supplements are not substitutes for a healthy\\ndiet. In addition, they are not absorbed well by a mal-\\nnourished body. Therefore, it is important to adhere to a\\nlow-fat,high-fiber diet. People should eat lots of fruits\\nand vegetables and limit consumption of coffee, alcohol,\\nred meat, processed foods, and foods high in fat or sugar.\\n• A naturopath or a nutritionist may recommend one or sev-\\neral individual supplements for short-term treatment for a\\nspecific mineral deficiency. However, if continued for too\\nlong, this may upset the mineral balance inside the body\\nand cause deficiencies of other minerals. For general good\\nhealth, it is best to use multiple vitamin and mineral sup-\\nplements with the minerals in the form of chelates.\\n• Because of potential interactions between minerals\\n(such as calcium, iron, or zinc) and other herbal supple-\\nments or medications, people should inform their doc-\\ntor about all supplements they are taking.\\n• Unlike vitamins, minerals are easily over used and can\\nbecome toxic. People should not take minerals at\\ndosages far exceeding the recommended ODI.\\nSide effects\\nThe following are some of the adverse effects associ-\\nated with high-dose individual mineral supplementation.\\n• Copper. Copper toxicity is a serious condition. Abdom-\\ninal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, gen-\\neral fatigue , headache , depression , insomnia , and\\npoor brain function are some of the adverse reactions\\nassociated with copper toxicity.\\n• Fluoride. High fluoride levels in the body may cause\\nstomach ulcers and increase the risk of bone cancer.\\n• Iron. Iron toxicity causes nausea, vomiting, and ab-\\ndominal pain. Too much iron in the diet has been asso-\\nciated with increased risk of infections and cancer.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 417\\nChelated minerals\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 417'),\n",

Proponents claim it also treats\\ncoronary artery disease and other illnesses that may be\\nlinked to damage from free radicals (reactive molecules).\\nOrigins\\nThe term chelation is from the Greek root word\\n“chele,” meaning “claw.” Chelating agents, most common-\\nly diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), were originally de-\\nsigned for industrial applications in the early 1900s. It was\\nnot until the World War II era that the potential for medical\\ntherapy was realized. The initial intent was to develop anti-\\ndotes to poison gas and radioactive contaminants. The need\\nfor widespread therapy of this nature did not materialize,\\nbut more practical uses were found for chelation. During\\nthe following decade, EDTA chelation therapy became\\nstandard treatment for people suffering from lead poison-\\ning. Patients who had received this treatment claimed to\\nhave other health improvements that could not be attrib-\\nuted to the lead removal only. Especially notable were\\ncomments from those who had previously suffered from\\nintermittent claudication and angina. They reported suffer-\\ning less pain and fatigue, with improved endurance, after\\nchelation therapy. These reports stimulated further interest\\nin the potential benefits of chelation therapy for people suf-\\nfering from atherosclerosisand coronary artery disease.\\nBenefits\\nThe benefits of EDTA chelation for the treatment of\\nlead poisoning and excessively high calcium levels are\\nundisputed. The claims of benefits for those suffering\\nfrom atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease, and other\\ndegenerative diseases are more difficult to prove. Report-\\ned uses for chelation therapy include treatment of angi-\\nna,gangrene, arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2418\\nChelation therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 418'),\n",

Improve-\\nment is also claimed for people experiencing diminished\\nsight, hearing, smell, coordination, and sexual potency.\\nDescription\\nIf the preparatory examination suggests that there is a\\ncondition that could be improved by chelation therapy,\\nand there is no health reason why it shouldn’t be used,\\nthen the treatment can begin. The patient is generally\\ntaken to a comfortable treatment area, sometimes in a\\ngroup location, and an intravenous line is started. A solu-\\ntion of EDTA together with vitamins and minerals tailored\\nfor the individual patient is given. Most treatments take\\nthree to four hours, as the infusion must be given slowly in\\norder to be safe. The number of recommended treatments\\nis usually between 20 and 40. They are given one to three\\ntimes a week. Maintenance treatments can then be given\\nat the rate of once or twice a month. Maximum benefits\\nare reportedly attained after approximately three months\\nafter a treatment series. The cost of therapy is consider-\\nable, but it is a fraction of the cost of an expensive medical\\nprocedure like cardiac bypass surgery. Intravenous vita-\\nmin C and mercury chelation therapies are also offered.\\nPreparations\\nA candidate for chelation therapy should initially have\\na thorough history and physical to define the type and ex-\\ntent of clinical problems. Laboratory tests will be done to\\ndetermine whether there are any conditions present that\\nmay prevent the use of chelation. Patients who have preex-\\nisting hypocalcemia, poor liver or kidney function, conges-\\ntive heart failure,hypoglycemia, tuberculosis, clotting\\nproblems, or potentially allergic conditions are at higher\\nrisk for complications from chelation therapy. A Doppler\\nultrasound may be performed to determine the adequacy of\\nblood flow in different regions of the body.\\nPrecautions\\nIt is important for people who receive chelation\\ntherapy to work with medical personnel who are experi-\\nenced in the use of this treatment. Treatment should not\\nbe undertaken before a good physical, lifestyle evalua-\\ntion, history, and any laboratory tests necessary are per-\\nformed. The staff must be forthcoming about test results\\nand should answer any questions the patient may have.\\nEvaluation and treatment should be individualized and\\ninvolve assessment of kidney function before each treat-\\nment with chelation, since the metals bound by the\\nEDTA are excreted through the kidneys.\\nAlthough EDTA binds harmful, toxic metals like\\nmercury, lead, and cadmium, it also binds some essential\\nnutrients of the body, such as copper, iron, calcium,\\nzinc, and magnesium . Large amounts of zinc are lost\\nduring chelation. Zinc deficiency can cause impaired im-\\nmune function and other harmful effects. Supplements of\\nzinc are generally given to patients undergoing chelation,\\nbut it is not known whether this is adequate to prevent\\ndeficiency. Also, chelation therapy does not replace\\nproper nutrition, exercise, and appropriate medications\\nor surgery for specific diseases or conditions.\\nSide effects\\nSide effects of chelation therapy are reportedly un-\\nusual, but are occasionally serious. Mild reactions may\\ninclude, but are not limited to, local irritation at the infu-\\nsion site, skin reactions,nausea, headache , dizziness ,\\nhypoglycemia, fever, leg cramps, or loose bowel move-\\nments. Some of the more serious complications reported\\nhave included hypocalcemia, kidney damage, decreased\\nclotting ability,anemia, bone marrow damage, insulin\\nshock, thrombophlebitis with embolism, and even rare\\ndeaths. However, some doctors feel that the latter groups\\nof complications occurred before the safer method cur-\\nrently used for chelation therapy was developed.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nEDTA chelation is a highly controversial therapy. The\\ntreatment is approved by the United States Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) for lead poisoning and seriously high\\ncalcium levels. However, for the treatment of atherosclerotic\\nheart disease, EDTA chelation therapy is not endorsed by\\nthe American Heart Association (AHA), the FDA, the Na-\\ntional Institutes of Health (NIH), or the American College of\\nCardiology. The AHA reports that there are no adequate,\\ncontrolled, published scientific studies using currently ap-\\nproved scientific methods to support this therapy for the\\ntreatment of coronary artery disease. However, a pooled\\nanalysis from the results of more than 70 studies showed\\npositive results in all but one. And in 2002, the American\\nCollege of Advancement in Medicine pledged its full sup-\\nport to a $30 million federal study aimed at determining the\\nsafety and efficacy of chelation therapy in patients with heart\\ndisease. The five-year clinical trial involves more than 2,000\\npeople at about 100 sites around the country.\\nTraining & certification\\nThe American Board of Chelation Therapy (ABCT)\\nprovides minimum standards for members administering\\nchelation.

Odle\\nChemical poisoning\\nDefinition\\nChemical poisoning is a major public health con-\\ncern. Approximately 95% of all accidental or intentional\\npoisonings are due to chemicals. Nearly 90% of these\\ncases occur at home. The smallest children, infants and\\ntoddlers, are at the highest risk for accidental (acute) poi-\\nsoning. In 2000, poison control centers received well\\nover a million calls about poison exposures to children\\nyounger than age 6. Chronic exposure is chemical poi-\\nsoning that occurs slowly and insidiously over a pro-\\nlonged period of time. Many chronic, degenerative dis-\\neases have been linked to environmental pollution or\\npoisoning. The list may include cancer, memory loss ,\\nallergies , multiple chemical sensitivity , chronic fa-\\ntigue syndrome , infertility in adults, learning and be-\\nhavioral disorders, developmental abnormalities, and\\nbirth defects in children.\\nDescription\\nCurrently there are millions of natural and synthetic\\nchemicals in our world. Approximately 3,000 of them\\nare known to cause significant health problems. Acci-\\ndental chemical poisoning involving common household\\nor garden products is easy to diagnose and treat, as long\\nas it is recognized early enough. On the other hand, poi-\\nsoning due to daily exposure to chemicals is more diffi-\\ncult to diagnose and the extent of damage is more diffi-\\ncult to assess. Toxic chemicals can be found everywhere\\n— in homes, in the yard, at work, on the playground—\\neven in foods and drinking water. Some result from ille-\\ngal dumping. However, many chemical poisoning occur\\ninsidiously by the supposedly harmless chemicals that\\npeople bring into their homes or office to make their\\nlives more comfortable.\\nHousehold poisons\\nBecause of the tremendous amounts of toxic chemi-\\ncals that can be found inside the house, scientists now\\nbelieve the home—not the office or the freeway—is the\\nmost contaminated place of all. Any chemicals found in-\\nside the house can be accidentally ingested by small chil-\\ndren. Daily exposure to chemicals indoors may also\\ncause significant health risks. Major chemical poisons\\ninside home include volatile organic compounds, lead,\\nradon, carbon monoxide, and those found in household\\ncleaners and carpet.\\nVOLATILE CHEMICALS. Indoor air pollution is\\ncaused by volatile chemicals. These are chemicals that\\nevaporate at room temperature. When we use products\\nthat contain these volatile substances, these chemicals\\nare trapped inside our homes reaching to levels thou-\\nsands of times higher than the outdoor air. Chronic expo-\\nsure to polluted air may cause lung infections ,\\nheadaches, nausea, mental confusion, fatigue, depres-\\nsion, and memory loss. In addition, they may cause dam-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2420\\nChemical poisoning\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAngina—Chest pain caused by reduced oxygen to\\nthe heart.\\nAtherosclerosis—Arterial disease characterized by\\nfatty deposits on inner arterial walls.\\nHypocalcemia—Low blood calcium.\\nHypoglycemia—Low blood sugar.\\nIntermittent claudication —Leg pain and weak-\\nness caused by walking.\\nThrombophlebitis —Inflammation of a vein to-\\ngether with clot formation.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 420'),\n",

The following are some of the most common\\nvolatile substances found inside our homes:\\n• trichloroethane (spray cans, insulation, spot removers)\\n• tetrachloroethylene (dry–cleaning solutions)\\n• formaldehyde (glue, foam, preservatives, plywood, fab-\\nrics, insulation)\\n• para-dichlorobenzene (P-DCB) (mothballs, air freshen-\\ners)\\n• toluene (solvents, cleaning fluids, wood finishing prod-\\nucts)\\n• benzene (gasoline)\\n• xylene (paints, finishing products)\\n• acetone (nail polish removers)\\n• styrene (foam, carpets, adhesives)\\n• carbon tetrachloride (dry cleaning solutions, paint re-\\nmovers)\\n• perchloroethylene (cleaning solvents)\\nLEAD AND OTHER HEAVY METALS. Lead is a very\\ntoxic chemical, especially to small children. It can cause\\npoisoning that leads to learning disabilities and behav-\\nioral problems in children. Lead poisoning in pregnant\\nmothers can cause fetal abnormalities, brain damage,\\nand impaired motor skills in babies. Lead is often found\\nin leaded paint (in old houses), pesticides, pottery and\\nchina, artist’s paint, and products used for hobbies and\\ncrafts. Also harmful are other heavy metals, such as mer-\\ncury and cadmium.\\nRADON. Radon is an odorless gas produced from\\nthe radioactive decay of uranium. It is believed to be the\\nmost common cause of lung cancer. In the outdoor envi-\\nronment, radon gas is usually too well-dispersed to accu-\\nmulate to dangerous levels. It is indoors, without proper\\nventilation, in places such as basements, where radon\\ncan seep from the soil and accumulate to dangerous con-\\ncentrations. The only way to know if a home is contami-\\nnated is through radon testing.\\nCARBON MONOXIDE. Carbon monoxide (CO) is the\\nmost lethal gas produced by a burning heat source.\\nSources of CO are gas heat, fireplaces, or idling cars in\\nthe garage. A CO detector is needed in all homes be-\\ncause this gas is odorless, colorless, and very deadly.\\nCHEMICALS TRAPPED INSIDE CARPET. Carpet con-\\ntains many chemicals capable of causing nerve damage.\\nThese neurotoxic chemicals include acetone, benzene,\\ntoluene, phenol, xylene, decane, and hexane.\\nHOUSEHOLD CLEANERS. The following are neuro-\\ntoxic chemicals commonly found in household cleaners:\\n• chlorine (dishwasher detergents)\\n• ammonia (antibacterial cleaning agents)\\n• petroleum (dish soaps, laundry detergents, floor waxes)\\nMEDICINES. Medicines are one of the most common\\ncauses of accidental and intentional (suicide) poisonings.\\nDrugs most commonly involved are aspirins, aceta-\\nminophen, sedatives, any psychoactive drug where a pa-\\ntient is more prone to impulsive, suicidal action (e.g., an-\\ntidepressants), antiseizure drugs,iron pills, vitamins/\\nmineral supplements containing iron, and cardiac drugs,\\nsuch as digoxin and quinidine.\\nYard chemicals\\nYard materials that can be toxic to humans and pets\\ninclude:\\n• Insecticides. Toxic chemicals that can be found in in-\\nsecticide preparations include chlordane, lindane,\\ntoxaphene, arsenic, lead, malathion, diazinon, and\\nnicotine.\\n• Rodenticides (chemicals that kill mice or rats). Roden-\\nticides often contain very toxic chemicals, such as\\nsodiumfluoroacetate, phosphorus , thallium, barium,\\nstrychnine, methyl bromide, and cyanides.\\n• Herbicides (chemicals that kill weed). Herbicides con-\\ntain carbaryl and diazinon, which increase the risk of\\nchildhood brain cancer.\\nOccupational hazards\\nWorkers are often exposed to toxic effects of various\\nchemicals in their working environment:\\n• Polluted air. Workers in poorly ventilated plants which\\nmanufacture paints, insecticides, fungicides, pesticides.\\n• Radiation. Workers in poorly constructed nuclear\\nchemical plants.\\n• Contaminated environment. Miners who labor under-\\nground.\\n• Obnoxious fumes. Fire fighters are most at risk.\\n• Skin contact with toxic chemicals. Crop pickers being\\naccidentally sprayed with insecticides.\\nToxic chemicals in foods\\nHighly processed or prepackaged foods use various\\nchemical additives to make these foods look more attrac-\\ntive, taste better, or store for longer periods of time.\\nHarmful substances that can be found in foods include:\\n• Monosodium glutamate (MSG), a common flavoring\\nagent.

It is often associated with the so-called “Chinese\\nrestaurant syndrome” characterized by headaches, nau-\\nsea,vomiting, palpitations, and flushing of skin, due to\\nthe MSG content in the food.\\n• Artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame or saccharin.\\nThese sweeteners can cause a variety of health prob-\\nlems, including headaches (migraines included),dizzi-\\nness, seizures, depression, nausea, and vomiting, and\\nabdominal cramps. Their use may be associated with\\nhyperactivity in children. Whether or not they may in-\\ncrease risk of cancer is unknown at this time. Pregnant\\nwomen should definitely avoid using these sweeteners.\\n• Artificial colors. Color additives can be found in a vari-\\nety of foods including cereals, juices, candy, frozen\\nfoods, ice cream, cookies, pizza, salad dressings and\\nsoft drinks. Children and adults alike may be exposed\\nto cancer-causing artificial colors such as Red numbers\\n8, 9, 19, and 37, or Orange number 17.\\n• Preservatives. Many of the preservatives found in foods\\nare very hazardous. Nitrates, a common preservatives\\nin cured and luncheon meats and canned products, are\\nknown to cause cancer. In addition, a pregnant woman\\nwho consumes large amounts of nitrates (for example,\\nthrough eating hot dogs or salami) unknowingly in-\\ncreases risk of brain damage in her unborn child. Syn-\\nthetic antioxidants are used in prepackaged foods to\\nprevent food spoilage. Common synthetic antioxidants,\\nsuch as butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated\\nhydroxytoluene (BHT), can be found in cereals, baking\\nmixes, or instant potatoes. These products are known to\\ncause brain, liver, and kidney damage, as well as respi-\\nratory problems.\\n• Food contaminants. Fruits and vegetables are definitely\\nhealthy foods. However, they may contain dangerous\\nherbicide and pesticide residues on the surface. Fish in\\ncontaminated lakes or rivers may contain mercury,\\ndioxin, PCBs, or other polluted chemicals. Babies of\\nmothers who ate contaminated fish during pregnancy\\nhave lower birth weight, smaller heads, developmental\\ndelays, and lower scores on tests of baby intelligence.\\nAir pollution and environmental contamination\\nAir pollution can cause or worsen lung or heart dis-\\neases and increase risk of cancer. Chemicals most often\\ncause pollution in the air and water supply include as-\\nbestos, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, lead, nitro-\\ngen oxides, halogenated hydrocarbons, and pesticides. In\\n2002, researchers reported a link between carbon\\nmonoxide in air pollution in Los Angeles and increased\\nrisk of heart defects in pregnant women’s developing\\nchildren. Women exposed to high levels of air pollution,\\nespecially that caused by vehicles, during the second\\nmonth of pregnancy were more likely to have children\\nwith heart-related birth defects.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nAcute poisoning\\nThe following are possible causes for acute poisoning:\\n• Accidental ingestion of household products. This af-\\nfects mostly children under five.\\n• Medication errors or mix-ups. This happens most often\\nto elderly people. Sometimes it is hospital staff that\\nmakes the error; at other times, it is the patient who\\ngets confused about the identity or dosage of the drugs.\\n• Suicide.\\n• Excessive alcohol or drug abuse.\\nThe following are signs and symptoms of acute\\nchemical poisoning:\\n• difficulty breathing\\n• changes in skin color\\n• headaches or blurred vision\\n• irritated eyes, skin or throat\\n• sweating\\n• dizziness\\n• breath odor: bitter almond (cyanide poisoning), garlic\\nodor (arsenic poisoning)\\n• nausea, vomiting, diarrhea\\n• unusual behavior\\n• difficulty walking or standing straight\\nChronic poisoning\\nCOMMON ROUTES OF EXPOSURE TO TOXIC CHEMI-\\nCALS. A person may accumulate toxic amounts of a\\nchemical in his or her body through daily exposure to the\\nchemicals. Common routes of exposure include:\\n• inhalation of the poisonous gas\\n• consumption of contaminated food, water, or medica-\\ntions\\n• contact with toxic or caustic chemicals in the eyes,\\nskin, or through contaminated clothing.\\n• pregnant mother’s exposure to toxic chemicals during\\npregnancy, especially during the first trimester\\nEFFECTS OF TOXIC CHEMICALS ON DEVELOPING FE-\\nTUSES AND CHILDREN.

The role of\\nthe physician is to determine what treatment (if any) is nec-\\nessary based on the amount of toxic substance ingested, the\\nidentity of the chemical and patient’s signs and symptoms.\\nChronic poisoning\\nChronic environmental poisoning is more difficult\\nto diagnose. To find out if environmental pollution is\\ncausing a person sick, a physician will conduct a thor-\\nough physical exam of the patient. He or she also obtains\\na thorough medical history with detailed information\\nconcerning the food and water sources, as well as the na-\\nture of the person’s work, or the place where he or she\\nlives. Lab tests may include blood and urine tests and\\nhair sample analysis. In addition, liver and kidney func-\\ntion tests are also conducted to see if these organs are af-\\nfected. The doctor also inquires about other diseases the\\npatient may have developed recently.\\nTreatment\\nAlternative treatments are not appropriate for acute\\nchemical poisoning. When an emergency poisoning oc-\\ncurs, especially in children, parents are encouraged to\\ncall a new toll-free hotline that is staffed 24 hours a day\\nat 1-800-222-1222. However, they may be useful in\\ntreating chronic exposure to toxic chemicals. Specific\\ntreatment plan depends on the type of poison by which a\\nperson is affected. Generally speaking, most treatments\\ninvolve identifying the offending chemical and avoiding\\nfuture exposures to the offending agent. A healthy diet,\\nnutritional supplements and/or detoxification therapy\\nare also helpful. Detoxification therapy is especially ef-\\nfective for the liver, which is the organ that metabolizes\\nmost toxins.\\nDetoxification diet\\nNaturopaths sometimes recommend patients sus-\\npected of chronic chemical poisoning to follow a “detox-\\nification diet” for at least several months. Pregnant\\nwomen, small children, or very frail people should avoid\\ntaking this diet. A detox diet has the following character-\\nistics:\\n• Low fat intake to increase fat mobilization (moving fat\\nfrom storage to be used for energy). Limited consump-\\ntion of olive oil and vegetable oils is allowed.\\n• Limited intake of sugar and highly processed foods,\\nand avoidance of alcohol, caffeine, and tobacco.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 423\\nChemical poisoning\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 423'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 440}, page_content='• High fiber consumption to absorb the toxic chemicals\\nand eliminate them from the body.\\n• Limited consumption of red meat. The bulk of protein\\nintake should come from vegetable sources, such as\\nlegumes and tofu, as well as fish from unpolluted waters.\\n• Strong emphasis on organic fruits and vegetables (and\\ntheir juices) with detoxification effects. They include\\npapayas, apples, pears, strawberries, dark green leafy\\nvegetables, carrots, beets, and garlic. Antioxidant\\nfoods, such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale, yams, toma-\\ntoes, peaches, watermelon, hot peppers,green tea, red\\ngrapes, citrus fruits, soybeans, and whole grains are\\nalso recommended.\\n• Increased water intake to at least eight glasses of water\\nper day to help eliminate waste from the body.\\n• Dietary supplementation with high potency multivita-\\nmin/mineral products.\\nExercise\\nExercise to the point of perspiration helps eliminate\\ntoxins from the body. Daily walking for 30 minutes is\\nhelpful and appropriate for most people.\\nHerbal therapy\\nMilk thistle (Silybum mariannum) is a powerful an-\\ntioxidant that protects the liver and assists in the detoxifi-\\ncation process by increasing glutathione supply in the\\nliver. Glutathione is the enzyme primarily involved in the\\ndetoxification of many toxic chemicals in the environ-\\nment, such as solvents, pesticides, and heavy metals.\\nTraditional Chinese medicine\\nDepending on a patient’s specific condition, an ex-\\npert Chinese herbalist may prescribe herbal remedies\\nthat can help remove toxins from the body and improve\\nliver function.\\nHomeopathy\\nFor homeopathic therapy, patients should consult a\\nhomeopathic physician who will prescribe specific reme-\\ndies based on knowledge of the underlying cause.\\nFasting\\nFasting is one of the most ancient ways of detoxifi-\\ncation and is also very efficient. During three-day fasting,\\npatients should take supplements and drink four glasses\\nof juice a day to assist the cleansing process and to pre-\\nvent exhaustion. Supplements recommended are those\\nthat include antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E,sele-\\nnium, zinc, and magnesium . For patients suspected of\\nsignificant poisoning, a naturopath may also prescribe\\nmilk thistle to aid the detoxification process and provide\\nsupport for the body. The patient may also consider con-\\nsuming a food fast, where only food that is simple to di-\\ngest is consumed. For example, “ultraclear” hydrolyzed\\nrice is simple to digest and is also hypo-allergenic.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nAcute poisoning\\nFor acute poisoning, patient or parents of an affected\\nchild should call 911, a local poison control center, or 1-\\n800-222-1222 immediately. The toll-free number is a na-\\ntional hotline launched nationwide in 2002 by the Ameri-\\ncan Association of Poison Control Centers to provide 24-\\nhour poison treatment and prevention services. If a child is\\nsuspected of eating or drinking hazardous chemicals, par-\\nents should look for the container and call for instructions.\\nPatients or parents of the poisoned child should wait for\\ninstructions before administering syrup of ipecac, activat-\\ned charcoal, or anything else by mouth. Treatment of a\\nparticular poison depends on the identity of the poison and\\nhow the poison was absorbed into the body.\\nINHALED POISONS. Treatment of inhaled poison in-\\ncludes bringing the patient out and away from the area\\ncontaminated with poisonous gas. The patient should be\\ngiven oxygen and other respiratory support as necessary.\\nSKIN AND EYE CONTAMINATION. If a person’s skin\\ncomes into contact with toxic chemicals, the contaminat-\\ned clothing should be removed, the chemical carefully\\nbrushed off the skin, and the body flushed with running\\nwater to dilute the poison. The wounds, if any, should be\\ncovered with sterile gauze or cloth and the patient be\\ntransferred to the hospital for treatment of chemical\\nburn. If toxic or caustic chemicals get in the eyes, the af-\\nfected person should remove glasses or any contact lens-\\nes from the eyes immediately, rinse the eyes well with\\nclean water or normal saline solution, and go to the\\nemergency room for further treatment or observation.\\nINGESTED POISONS. Depending on the specific type\\nof ingested poisons, syrup of ipecac, activated charcoal,\\nand/or gastric lavage can be used.\\nFor most cases of accidental poisoning, the drug\\nparents and doctors can rely on is syrup of ipecac. When\\nswallowed, it irritates the stomach and induces vomiting.\\nSyrup of ipecac is now considered the safest drug to treat\\npoisoning and is often the most effective. Syrup of\\nipecac can be used for most ingested poisons. However,\\nsyrup of ipecac should not be used if the suspected poi-\\nson is strychnine, a corrosive substance (strong acids or\\nlye), petroleum products (gasoline, kerosene, paint thin-\\nner, or cleaning fluids), or certain prescription drugs,\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2424\\nChemical poisoning\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 424'),\n",

In addition, it should not be used in patients\\nwho are unconscious or seizing.\\nActivated charcoal is also an effective treatment for\\nmany chemical poisons. It can absorb poisons quickly and\\nin large amounts. In addition, it is nontoxic, may be stored\\nfor a long time, and can be conveniently administered at\\nhome. Charcoal works by binding to irritating or toxic sub-\\nstances in the stomach and intestines. This prevents the\\ntoxic drug or chemical from spreading throughout the body.\\nThe toxic drug or chemical and the activated charcoal will\\nbe excreted in the stools without harming the body.\\nIf both syrup of ipecac and charcoal are recom-\\nmended for treatment of the poison, ipecac should be\\ngiven first. Charcoal should not be given for at least 30\\nminutes after ipecac or until vomiting from ipecac stops.\\nActivated charcoal is often mixed with a liquid before\\nbeing swallowed or put into the tube leading to the stom-\\nach. Activated charcoal is available as 30-g liquid bot-\\ntles. It is also available in 15-g container sizes, and as\\nslurry of charcoal premixed in water, or as a container in\\nwhich water or soda pop is added.\\nCharcoal should not be used to treat poisoning\\ncaused by corrosive products, such as lye or other strong\\nacids, or petroleum products, such as gasoline, kerosene,\\nor cleaning fluids. Charcoal may make the condition\\nworse and delay the diagnosis and treatment. In addition,\\ncharcoal is also not effective if the poison is lithium,\\ncyanide, iron, ethanol, or methanol.\\nGastric lavage may also be used to treat chemical\\npoisoning. This procedure is done by medical profes-\\nsionals in emergency rooms only. Lavage fluids (saline\\nwater or water) is given through a large tube down the\\npatient’s throat and the stomach contents are pumped\\nout. This procedure is repeated many times until the\\nphysician is confident that most of the toxic substance is\\nremoved. Then a specific antidote for the chemical or ac-\\ntivated charcoal can be given to absorb the rest.\\nSometimes, antidotes are available to neutralize poi-\\nson and render it harmless. The following are some of\\nthe common antidotes:\\n• naloxone: for morphine, methadone, or heroine overdose\\n• atropine: for organophosphate (insecticide) poisoning\\n• acetylcysteine: for acetaminophen (Tylenol) toxicity\\n• digoxin immune fab (Digibind): for digoxin toxicity\\nChronic chemical poisoning\\nTreatment of chronic chemical poisoning involves\\nidentifying, eliminating the source of poison from the pa-\\ntient’s environment, and symptomatic treatment of the\\ncondition. Chelation therapy can be used to remove\\nheavy metals, such as lead, iron, mercury,copper, nickel,\\nzinc, cadmium, beryllium, and arsenic. This treatment\\nuses chelating agents, such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic\\nacid (EDTA) and dimethylsuccinate (DMSA) to bind and\\nprecipitate metals and remove them from the body.\\nExpected results\\nDepending on the severity of the poisoning, the af-\\nfected person may have total or partial recovery. If the\\nrescue effort comes too late, a patient may die of acute\\nchemical or drug poisoning. For those affected by chronic\\nexposure to environmental poisoning, recovery depends\\non the severity of the poisoning, the ability to stay away\\nfrom the offending agent, and appropriate diagnosis and\\ntreatment. Total recovery can occur in many patients.\\nPrevention\\n• Avoiding eating contaminated fish, especially that\\nwhich comes from known contaminated areas or a lot\\nof big fish, such as shark, swordfish, or tuna, which\\ntend to contain higher amounts of mercury than smaller\\nfish. Pregnant women should not consume more than 7\\noz of tuna per week. Mercury can cause brain damage\\nin the developing fetus.\\n• Not painting or remodeling a home while pregnant or\\nwhen the children are still small. Paint contains lead\\nand cadmium that can harm developing fetus and cause\\nlearning disabilities in small children.\\n• Limiting use of chemicals inside the house as much as\\npossible and instead using natural alternatives, such as\\nbaking soda (as cleaner, deodorizer), distilled white\\nvinegar (as cleaner),essential oils(as fragrances), lemon\\njuice (as cleaner), and liquid soaps (as detergents).\\n• Increasing ventilation inside the house.\\n• Considering installing tile or wood floors in new homes\\ninstead of new carpet.\\n• Having the house tested for radon.\\n• Eating organic foods. Otherwise, to better remove tox-\\nins, washing fruits and vegetables carefully before eat-\\ning with a mild acid solution, such as diluted vinegar.\\n• Avoiding toxic chemical exposure as much as possible\\nif pregnant.\\n• Keeping all medications, petroleum products, cleaning\\nproducts locked and away from small children. In-\\nstalling child-proof locks or gates to prevent children\\nfrom finding poisons.\\n• Avoiding mixing up household cleaning products.

Roman historian Pliny reported that sour\\ncherries were introduced to ancient Rome as part of a\\nvictory celebration after the defeat of the Parthians at a\\nplace called Cerasus.\\nFrom the simple division of sweet and sour cherries,\\nclassification of the various cherry types has grown in-\\ncreasingly complex through the years. Today, there are\\nliterally hundreds of varieties due to their long record of\\ncultivation and crossbreeding.\\nCherry trees have been used widely for their fruit,\\neaten fresh and also used in cooking. Both the fermented\\nfruit and the crushed pits are used in making the Euro-\\npean liqueur kirsch. The tree is also a source of wood\\nused in making high-quality furniture. The stalks from\\nsome of these cherry varieties have been used medicinal-\\nly as an astringent. However, it’s most widely accepted\\nthat the cherry tree whose bark is utilized in herbal medi-\\ncine is the wild cherry (listed now as Prunus serotina ,\\nbut in nineteenth century herbal books is listed as Prunus\\nvirginianus).\\nThe wild cherry is a native of North America. It is\\nfound in central and northern parts of the United States,\\nas well as in cooler, nondesert parts of the Southwest.\\nWild cherry trees characteristically grow to a height of\\n50-80 ft (15.2-24.4 m), with a trunk width of 2-4 ft (0.6-\\n1.2 m). The leaf of the wild cherry is oval, with a\\nminutely serrated edge, and is more pointed toward the\\ntip. Its leaves are approximately 3 in (7.6 cm) in length,\\ndark green and shiny on top, and paler and fuzzy on the\\nunderside. Small, white, petaled flowers appear along\\nthe stems before the leaves in early spring. Pea-sized,\\npurplish black fruits that are bitter develop and ripen by\\nlate summer.\\nThe outer bark of the wild cherry tree is dark gray to\\nblack, very rough to the touch, and breaks away easily\\nfrom the trunk. Even though the bark from the roots,\\ntrunk, and branches has medicinal properties, it is the\\nroot bark that is the most beneficial. Beneath a cherry\\nroot’s dark outer covering, the interior is a dusky reddish\\ncolor. It has an almond-like aroma that evaporates when\\ndried, but re-emerges when the bark is crushed or dis-\\nsolved. Its tastes astringent and bitter. Its chemical con-\\nstituents include cyanogenic glycosides, starch, resin,\\ntannin, gallic acid, fatty matter, lignin, red coloring ma-\\nterial, as well as calcium, potassium, and iron salts.\\nGeneral use\\nWild cherry bark has a strong sedating effect on the\\ncough reflex and is particularly useful to treat dry, non-\\nproductive coughs in respiratory conditions. Because of\\nits antispasmodic qualities, it has been used with other\\nherbs to treat asthma. It is given for spasmodic cough to\\nenhance relaxation and resting or at night to reduce\\ncough and enhance sleep. Its astringent properties make\\nit useful as a bitter, taken to stimulate sluggish digestion\\nand the appetite. A cold infusion of wild cherry bark has\\nbeen noted to soothe eye inflammation.\\nPreparations\\nBark is collected in the autumn by carefully strip-\\nping away small sections. The outer wild cherry bark is\\nthen removed and the lighter colored, reddish interior\\ncortex is dried, but not in direct sunlight. Once thorough-\\nly dried, it must be stored in airtight containers away\\nfrom light. Because it deteriorates so rapidly, it is more\\nbeneficial if used when still fresh and must be newly col-\\nlected each year. The fragments of inner bark crush easi-\\nly to make a powder. This powdered cherry bark can\\nthen be dissolved in either alcohol or water. A cough\\nremedy is made by dissolving 4 oz (113 g) of the bark in\\n4 oz (120 ml) of water for several hours. The solution is\\nthen strained, and honey is added to sweeten to taste.\\nBoiling cherry bark is not recommended since this de-\\ncreases the medicinal properties. Cherry bark can also be\\nused to make a tincture and lozenges.\\nPrecautions\\nCoughing is a normal and helpful reaction to airway\\nor lung irritation. It is designed to expel harmful sub-\\nstances (such as excess phlegm or irritants) from the\\nlungs. Suppressing a cough, then, can actually prevent or\\npostpone recovery. It is persistent coughing that needs\\ntreatment. It is also important for potential users to re-\\nmembered that a cough is merely a symptom of some\\nother illness, as are digestive problems.

It produces an itchy, blistery rash that typi-\\ncally lasts about a week and is sometimes accompanied\\nby a fever or other symptoms.\\nDescription\\nAbout four million Americans contract chickenpox\\neach year, resulting in roughly 5,000-9,000 hospitaliza-\\ntions and 100 deaths. Chickenpox is caused by the vari-\\ncella-zoster virus (a member of the herpes virus family),\\nwhich is spread through the air or by direct contact with\\nan infected person. Once someone has been infected\\nwith the virus, symptoms appear in about 10-21 days.\\nThe period during which infected people can spread the\\ndisease is believed to start one or two days before the\\nrash appears until all the blisters have formed scabs,\\nusually four to seven days after the rash breaks out. For\\nthis reason, doctors recommend keeping children with\\nchickenpox away from school for about a week.\\nChickenpox has been a typical part of growing up\\nfor most children in the industrialized world (although\\nthis may change because of the new varicella vaccine).\\nThe disease can strike at any age, but by ages nine or 10\\nabout 80-90% of American children have already been\\ninfected. U.S. children living in rural areas and many\\nforeign-born children are less likely to be immune. Be-\\ncause almost every case of chickenpox leads to lifelong\\nprotection, adults account for less than 5% of all cases in\\nthe United States. Study results reported by the Centers\\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicate that\\nmore than 90% of American adults are immune to the\\nchickenpox virus. Adults, however, are much more likely\\nthan children to suffer dangerous complications. More\\nthan half of all chickenpox deaths occur among adults.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nA case of chickenpox usually starts without warning\\nor with only a mild fever and a slight feeling of unwell-\\nness. Within a few hours or days small red spots begin to\\nappear on the scalp, neck, or upper half of the trunk. After\\na further 12-24 hours the spots typically become itchy,\\nfluid-filled bumps called vesicles, which continue to ap-\\npear for the next two to five days. In any area of skin, le-\\nsions of a variety of stages can be seen. These blisters can\\nspread to cover much of the skin, and in some cases may\\nalso be found inside the mouth, nose, ears, vagina, or rec-\\ntum. Some people develop only a few blisters, but in most\\ncases the number reaches 250-500. The blisters soon\\nbegin to form scabs and fall off. Scarring usually does not\\noccur unless the blisters have been scratched and become\\ninfected. Occasionally a minor and temporary darkening\\nof the skin (called hyperpigmentation) is noticed around\\nsome of the blisters. The degree of itchiness can range\\nfrom barely noticeable to extreme. Some chickenpox suf-\\nferers also have headaches, abdominal pain, or a fever.\\nFull recovery usually takes five to 10 days after the first\\nsymptoms appear. The most severe cases of the disease\\ntend to be found among older children and adults.\\nSome groups are at risk for developing complica-\\ntions, the most common of which are bacterial infec-\\ntions of the blisters, pneumonia , dehydration, en-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2428\\nChickenpox\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAntispasmodic —An agent used to relieve muscle\\nspasms.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 428'),\n",

Immediate medical help should\\nalways be sought when anyone in these high-risk groups\\ncontracts the disease. These include:\\n• Infants. Complications occur much more often among\\nchildren less than one year old than among older chil-\\ndren. The threat is greatest to newborns, who are more\\nat risk of death from chickenpox than any other group.\\nChildren born to mothers who contract chickenpox just\\nprior to delivery face an increased possibility of dan-\\ngerous consequences, including brain damage and\\ndeath. If the infection occurs during early pregnancy,\\nthere is a small (less than 5%) risk of birth defects.\\n• Immunocompromised children. Children whose im-\\nmune systems have been weakened by a genetic disor-\\nder, disease, or medical treatment usually experience\\nthe most severe symptoms of any group. They have the\\nsecond-highest rate of death from chickenpox.\\n• Adults and children 15 and older. The typical symp-\\ntoms of chickenpox tend to strike this group with\\ngreater force.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhere children are concerned, especially those with\\nrecent exposure to the disease, diagnosis can usually be\\nmade at home, by a school nurse, or by a doctor over the\\ntelephone if the child’s parent or caregiver is unsure that\\nthe disease is chickenpox. A doctor should be called im-\\nmediately if:\\n• The child’s fever goes above 102°F (38.9°C) or takes\\nmore than four days to disappear.\\n• The child’s blisters appear infected. Signs of infection\\ninclude pus drainage or excessive redness, warmth, ten-\\nderness, or swelling.\\n• The child seems nervous, confused, unresponsive, or\\nunusually sleepy; complains of a stiff neck or severe\\nheadache; shows signs of poor balance or has trouble\\nwalking; finds bright lights hard to look at; is having\\nbreathing problems or is coughing a lot; is complaining\\nof chest pain; is vomiting repeatedly; or is having con-\\nvulsions. These may be signs of Reye’s syndrome or\\nencephalitis, two rare but potentially very dangerous\\nconditions.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment focuses on reducing symptoms of chick-\\nenpox. The patient should drink plenty of fluids and eat\\nsimple, nutritious foods. Soups (especially mung bean),\\nherbal teas, and fruit juices are good choices.\\nApplying wet compresses or bathing the patient in\\ncool or lukewarm water once a day can help the itch.\\nAdding four to eight ounces of baking soda or one or two\\ncups of oatmeal to the bath is helpful. Only mild soap\\nshould be used and patting, not rubbing, is recommended\\nfor drying the patient. The patient should not scratch the\\nblisters as this can lead to infection or scarring. For ba-\\nbies, light mittens or socks on the hands can help guard\\nagainst scratching. If mouth blisters are present, cold\\ndrinks and soft, bland foods can make eating less painful.\\nSupplements\\nVitamin A may help to heal skin. Vitamin C and\\nbioflavinoids help to reduce fever and stimulate the im-\\nmune system. Zinc stimulates the immune system and\\npromotes healing. Zinc can cause nausea and vomiting.\\nCalcium and magnesium help to relieve restlessness\\nand sleeping difficulties.

The varicella-zoster virus lies dormant in the\\nnerve cells, where it may be reactivated years later by\\ndisease or age-related weakening of the immune system.\\nThe result is shingles (herpes zoster), a very painful rash\\nand nerve inflammation, that strikes about 20% of the\\npopulation, particularly people 50 and older.\\nPrevention\\nA substance known as varicella-zoster immune globu-\\nlin (VZIG), which reduces the severity of chickenpox\\nsymptoms, is available to treat persons at high risk of devel-\\noping complications. It is administered by injection within\\n96 hours of known or suspected exposure to the disease.\\nA vaccine for chickenpox (Varivax) has been found\\nto prevent the disease in 70-90% of the vaccinated popu-\\nlation, to reduce the severity of disease in the remaining\\ncases. CDC and the American Academy of Pediatricians\\nrecommend vaccination of all children (with some ex-\\nceptions) at 12-18 months of age. For older children, up\\nto age 12, the CDC recommends vaccination when im-\\nmunity cannot be confirmed. Vaccination is also recom-\\nmended for any older child or adult considered suscepti-\\nble to the disease, particularly those who face a greater\\nlikelihood of severe illness or transmitting infection. A\\nsingle dose of the vaccine is sufficient for children up to\\nage 12; older children and adults receive a second dose\\nfour to eight weeks later.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nPattishall, Evan G., III. “Chickenpox.” In Primary Pediatric\\nCare. edited by Robert A.

It\\nthrives in shady, moist locations in gardens, near human\\nhabitations, and on the edge of woods. The herb is often\\nfound growing under the shade of oak trees. Chickweed\\nis a persistent annual. It self-seeds and may produce as\\nmany as five generations within one season.\\nThe genus name Stellaria refers to chickweed’s tiny,\\nwhite, star-shaped flowers. The common name refers to\\nthe herb’s appeal to birds and barnyard fowl, particularly\\nyoung chickens. Other common names include Indian\\nchickweed, stitchwort, starwort, white bird’s eye, chick\\nwittles, satin flower, adder’s mouth, mouse ear, starweed,\\npasserina, tongue grass, and winter weed. Chickweed\\nhas been used for centuries. The nutritious herb was fed\\nto caged birds and rabbits. It was also traditionally pre-\\npared as an early spring tonic, eaten fresh or steamed, to\\ncleanse the kidneys and liver. English physician Nicholas\\nCulpeper described chickweed as “a fine soft pleasing\\nherb under the dominion of the Moon.”\\nChickweed is a juicy, succulent, low-growing, and del-\\nicate herb which grows from a slender taproot. The straggly,\\nweak stems may stretch along the ground for two feet or\\nmore forming dense mats only a few inches off the ground.\\nThe light-green, oval, and entire leaves grow in opposite\\npairs about an inch apart along the smooth and branching\\nstem. A single line of fine white hairs grow along one side\\nor the other of the thin stems, alternating at the node of each\\npair of leaves. Stems are slightly swollen at the joints.\\nLeaves appear stalkless at the growing tip but the older\\nleaves develop stalks at least as long as the attached leaf. At\\nnight the half-inch long leaves close in on each other to pro-\\ntect the developing buds. The tiny white flowers grow\\nsingly in the leaf axils of the upper leaves. The five petals\\nare deeply incised, and smaller than the pointed green sepa-\\nls. Blossoms open in the sun and close on cloudy, gray days\\nand throughout the night hours. Minuscule seed capsules,\\nwith a barely-perceptible toothed edge, follow the blos-\\nsoms. In damp weather the “teeth” swell, effectively closing\\nthe capsule to protect the ripening seed. The tiny yellow-or-\\nange seeds continue to ripen even after the herb is harvest-\\ned. Chickweed self-seeds freely in cool, moist habitats.\\nGeneral use\\nThe entire chickweed plant is edible. The stems and\\nleaves are used in medicinal preparations. Herbalists,\\nhowever, disagree about the medicinal potency of chick-\\nweed. One writer, a professor of pharmacognosy, dis-\\nmissed chickweed as a “worthless weed” and an “ineffec-\\ntive herb.” Other writers and herbalists praise the diminu-\\ntive herb for providing “optimum nutrition” and for its\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention.

It has been used to\\ntreat bronchitis, pleurisy, colitis, gastritis, asthma, and\\nsore throat . The herb’s diuretic action helps eliminate\\ntoxins from the system and reduce retention of fluids.\\nChickweed contains mucilage, saponins,silica,\\ncoumarins, flavonoids (including glycoside rutin), triter-\\npenoids, and carboxylic acids. The herb is rich in miner-\\nals, including copper and iron, and vitamins A, B, and C.\\nGathered fresh, chickweed is beneficial in poultice\\nform to ease rheumatic pain and to treat boils and ab-\\nscesses. The herb can also be used to draw out splinters\\nand the stingers of insects and to dissolve warts. Its vul-\\nnerary (wound-healing) action speeds the healing of cuts\\nand wounds. Its emollient qualities soothe itching and ir-\\nritation of eczema or psoriasis. An infusion may be added\\nto bath water for soothing relief of inflamed skin. It also\\nprovides relief to swollen and painful hemorrhoids.\\nAnother species of chickweed, S. dichotoma, known\\nas yin chai hu is used in Chinese medicine to stop nose-\\nbleed, to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding, and to bring\\ndown fevers. The species S. alsine is also used in Chi-\\nnese medicine as a medicinal remedy for treating colds,\\nsnakebites, and even traumatic injury.\\nPreparations\\nGather chickweed from young plants before or dur-\\ning flowering and throughout the year. Snipping the\\nstems will encourage growth of new branches for later\\nharvest. The freshly harvested herb will keep for several\\ndays if refrigerated. The fresh herb may be eaten in sal-\\nads, or very, very lightly steamed as a potherb. Chick-\\nweed has a somewhat bland taste, so other edible greens\\nmay be added to the pot to enhance the flavor.\\nInfusion: Place 2 oz of fresh chickweed leaves and\\nstems in a warmed glass container. Bring 2.5 cups of\\nfresh, nonchlorinated water to the boiling point, and add\\nit to the herbs. Cover and infuse the tea for about 10 min-\\nutes. Strain and drink warm. The prepared tea will store\\nfor about two days in a sealed container in the refrigera-\\ntor. Chickweed tea may be enjoyed by the cupful up to\\nthree times a day. A strong infusion may be used as a skin\\nwash or bath additive to soothe itching and inflamed skin.\\nPoultice: Chop fresh chickweed leaves and stems in\\nsufficient quantity to cover the area being treated. Sprinkle\\nthe herb with water and place over the area. Cover the\\nherbal mass with a strip of wet cotton gauze to hold the\\npoultice in place. When gathering the older, tougher plant,\\nthe herb may be simmered either in water alone or in a\\n50/50 mixture of water and vinegar for about five minutes.\\nApply to the skin after the mixture has sufficiently cooled.\\nTincture: Combine four ounces of finely-cut fresh or\\npowdered dry herb with one pint of brandy, gin, or vodka,\\nin a glass container. The alcohol should be enough to\\ncover the plant parts. Place the mixture away from light\\nfor about two weeks, shaking several times each day.\\nStrain and store in a tightly-capped, dark glass bottle. A\\nstandard dose is 1–4 ml of the tincture three times a day.\\nPrecautions\\nThe wind-blown pollen of chickweed may aggravate\\nhay fever.

Frey, PhD\\nChigong see Qigong\\nChildbirth\\nDefinition\\nChildbirth, or parturition, is the process of labor that\\ndilates the cervix, as well as the delivery of the baby and\\nplacenta through the birth canal.\\nDescription\\nMost babies are born following approximately nine\\ncalendar months of pregnancy. Delivery between 37–42\\nweeks of gestation is considered normal and full-term. A\\nbaby born prior to 37 weeks of gestation is considered\\npremature, or preterm. After 42 weeks, it is considered\\npostterm. Each of the latter circumstances is considered\\na higher risk delivery.\\nLabor occurs in three stages. The first is the dilation\\nof the cervix, the second is the delivery of the baby, and\\nthe third is the expulsion of the placenta. However, ap-\\nproximately 25% of babies born in the United States are\\nsurgically delivered by Caesarean section. This can be a\\nnecessary and even life-saving procedure, but this per-\\ncentage is probably much larger than it could be with\\nbetter management of labor and more informed birthing\\nconsumers.\\nA 2001 report showed that older pregnant women\\nare more likely to deliver via Caesarean and also may\\nmore likely required induced labor. At one time, “once a\\nCaesarean, always a Caesarean” meant a woman could\\nnot deliver vaginally after having a Caesarean, but that is\\nno longer true for everyone. Women who have had previ-\\nous surgical deliveries are increasingly choosing vaginal\\nbirth after Caesarean (VBAC). Having a sympathetic, in-\\nformed caregiver and preparation helps achieve this goal.\\nThe first stage of labor is the time that is required\\nfor the cervix to reach full dilation. It includes latent\\n(early), active, and transition phases. The latent phase of\\nlabor, when the cervix progresses from being closed to 3\\ncm open, may last for days or longer. For some women,\\nlatent labor is not a distinguishable phase, and for others\\nit leads immediately into active labor. The latent phase is\\noften exciting for the mother, who wonders if her baby is\\nfinally going to be born. Contractions during this phase\\nare not very painful. Active labor ensues around the time\\nthe cervix reaches 3 cm dilation, and continues until ap-\\nproximately 7 cm dilation. At this stage, labor contrac-\\ntions are powerful, and require the mother’s concentra-\\ntion. The length of this stage is also variable, and is usu-\\nally longer for first-time mothers than for those having\\nsubsequent babies. Active labor is followed by transition.\\nThis is the shortest and most intense stage of labor, when\\nmany women express feelings of despair, or “not being\\nPlacenta\\nUterus\\nUmbilical cord\\nVagina\\nCervix\\nStage 1: Dilation of the cervix\\nStage 1: Dilation of the cervix.

Since prolonged rupture\\nof membranes prior to delivery presents a risk of infec-\\ntion, the care provider for the mother should be contact-\\ned whether or not she is experiencing contractions.\\nEven experienced mothers sometimes have difficulty\\ntelling when labor begins, as prelabor may occur on and\\noff for days or longer before settling into a regular pattern.\\nIn general, the contractions associated with labor will\\ngradually get more frequent, more regular, longer, and\\nstronger. Walking or changing activity will not alter them.\\nThese contractions are effective at changing the cervix,\\nwhich will become appreciably lower, thinner, and more\\ndilated. By contrast, contractions of prelabor stay about\\nthe same intensity and frequency. A change of activity will\\noften make them disappear. These contractions may be\\nuncomfortable, and may even cause some mild cervical\\nchanges, but there is not a change on an hourly basis.\\nDiagnosis\\nFor women who choose to deliver in a hospital, a di-\\nagnosis of active labor is generally made if contractions\\nare regular and strong, and the cervix is effacing and/or\\ndilating noticeably on an hourly basis. A woman who ar-\\nrives at the hospital reporting regular contractions who\\nhas no complicating factors is generally observed for at\\nleast an hour to see whether her labor will progress.\\nMonitors that fit around the abdomen measure the fetal\\nheart rate, and the nature of the contractions. A nurse\\nwill check the position and station of the baby, as well as\\nthe effacement, dilation, and position of the mother’s\\ncervix. Admission is generally made regardless of\\nprogress if the water has broken (rupture of mem-\\nbranes), or if there are complications, such as high ma-\\nternal blood pressure, more than one fetus, fetal distress,\\nabnormal fetal presentation, or excessive bleeding.\\nWomen delivering before 37 weeks or after 42 weeks of\\ngestation are also well-advised to deliver in a hospital.\\nTreatment\\nFor a routine, uncomplicated labor and delivery, the\\nprimary treatment required is assistance with comfort\\nmeasures. What each mother finds comforting is very in-\\ndividual. At some point during the pregnancy, it is a\\ngood idea to make a list of things to try to relieve pain\\nduring labor, in the event that one or two favored tech-\\nniques don’t work. A mother who generally enjoys mas-\\nsage may suddenly discover that it is distracting to be\\ntouched during active labor; one who plans to rely on\\nmedication could have an epidural that does not take, or\\nbe laboring too quickly for it to be allowed. Having a list\\nof comfort measures to refer to will be useful and reas-\\nable to do it anymore.” At the end of transition, the\\ncervix is fully dilated to 10 cm, and pushing can begin.\\nThe second stage of labor is pushing the baby out\\nthrough the vagina (birth canal). Contractions are gener-\\nally less frequent than in the first stage of labor, but are\\nvery strong and long lasting. Many women find it a relief\\nto be able to push. In the unmedicated mother, pushing is\\nreflexive and instinctual. The pressure of the baby’s head\\non stretch receptors in the maternal pelvis triggers the\\nurge to push. Pushing is another phase where nature\\ngives credit to the woman who has had a previous birth.\\nFirst-time mothers generally push for about 60 minutes;\\nsubsequent births require an average of only 15 minutes.\\nThe third stage of labor is the delivery of the placen-\\nta, which often goes unnoticed by the mother who is at-\\ntending to her newborn. After the baby is delivered, the\\nuterus should continue to contract in order to push out\\nthe placenta. This organ functioned to bring the baby\\nnourishment from the mother throughout the pregnancy,\\nand return the child’s waste products to the mother to be\\nexcreted. If contractions become sluggish or stop before\\nthe placenta is delivered, breastfeeding the baby can trig-\\nger the release of the hormone oxytocin to stimulate the\\nuterus to contract again. Alternatively, artificial oxytocin\\n(pitocin) can be given by injection.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe onset of spontaneous labor may be marked by\\nirregular contractions, not very different from the Brax-\\nton-Hicks contractions that are common throughout late\\npregnancy.

Reassurance is impor-\\ntant, as relieving stress during labor allows it to progress\\nmore quickly and with less pain. Many women find it\\nhelpful to employ an experienced doula, or birth assis-\\ntant, to provide comfort, reassurance, and information.\\nFear of the unknown can certainly contribute to in-\\ncreased pain. Expectant parents should learn all they can\\nabout the process of childbirth. Many good reference books\\nare available. Taking Lamaze classes lends a personal\\ntouch, and many couples enjoy the camaraderie of sharing\\nthe learning experience with other expectant families. Even\\nthough labor can take unexpected turns, being aware of the\\noptions at each stage will lend some perception of control.\\nMaking a list of birth preferences can be helpful in defining\\nwhat the parents desire at the birth, but flexibility is impor-\\ntant to avoid disappointment if every expectation is not met.\\nAcupuncture\\nA skilled acupuncturist may be able to offer some\\nrelief of labor pain, particularly for women who have\\npreviously found acupuncture to be helpful with other\\ntypes of pain.\\nMassage therapy\\nSome women find massage or therapeutic touch to\\nbe quite relaxing during labor. Contractions are some-\\ntimes felt quite intensely in the back, and a combination\\nof massage and counterpressure can offer relief. Foot\\nmassage may also be comforting, both during pregnancy\\nand labor. There is a great temptation for the laboring\\nwoman to tense her abdomen against a contraction. The\\ncontraction will be more effective and less painful with\\neffleurage (light stroking) of the area, and a verbal re-\\nminder to let the abdomen hang heavy and relax. The\\njaw area is also frequently clenched, and benefits from\\nrelaxation. Gentle touch and massage of any area that\\nappears tense will help to relieve stress. This is a good\\ntechnique to practice before labor begins.\\nMusic\\nThe sounds of a favorite piece of music can be an\\nexcellent aid to relaxation. Instrumentals are generally\\npreferable to singing. Soothing sounds or tunes that\\nevoke happy memories are helpful. Some women enjoy\\ntapes of nature sounds.\\nHydrotherapy\\nA warm tub or shower may be one of the most under-\\nestimated methods of relieving the pain of labor. Warmth\\nencourages muscle relaxation, which in turn decreases anx-\\niety. The water in a tub also supports the mother’s body. In\\na jetted tub, position and water pressure can be adjusted to\\nsoothe areas that are cramping or painful. This may be par-\\nticularly comforting for back labor. In a birthing pool or\\nlarge tub, the mother is free to move around and find a posi-\\ntion that optimizes her comfort. The relaxation brought on\\nby water can make for a shorter, more comfortable labor.\\nAromatherapy\\nSome essential oils are particularly recommended\\nduring birth for those women who enjoy the scents. They\\ncan be added to a diffuser or a crock-pot of water in the\\nbirthing area, emitted from a scented candle, or concen-\\ntrated drops of the scent can be placed on the pillow and\\nbed linens. Clary sage and lavender are popular choices,\\nbut any scent that is pleasant to the mother may be used.\\nVisualization\\nThe use of visualization, or guided imagery, can be\\npowerful to promote relaxation and the progress of labor.\\nOne exercise that can be practiced in advance of labor is\\nchoosing a place or image that the mother associates\\nwith comfort, security, and serenity. This place can be\\nimagined and explored at any time to help relieve stress.\\nIf the details of this visualization are shared with some-\\none who will be present during labor, that person can\\nhelp to evoke those feelings during times of pain or\\nstress. Another popular visualization is that of a flower\\nblooming. The cervix can be envisioned as a flower bud\\nthat gradually opens to allow the baby to descend. Other\\nscripts for guided imagery can be practiced to relieve\\nstress and reduce pain.\\nIncreasingly, women (not in high-risk pregnancies)\\ndesire a more “low-tech” approach to labor and choose a\\nnurse midwife to assist them rather than a physician.

In 1998, a nurse-\\nmidwife rather than a physician attended almost 9% of\\nbirths, which is more than twice the number in 1989.\\nNurse-midwives committed to helping meet mothers’ in-\\ndividual needs and to give them freedom of choice dur-\\ning birth. They work to provide a natural childbirth and\\nto help the woman prevent complications before, during,\\nand after the birth. Those wishing to use midwives\\nshould check with the obstetrician and also determine if\\nthe midwife is certified (CNM). More and more obstetri-\\ncian practices also employ or work with nurse-midwives.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nModern pain relief for childbirth generally involves\\nthe use of medication. Although medication has evolved\\nfrom the days of mothers being put under “twilight\\nsleep” for a normal vaginal birth, the use of chemical\\npain relief is not without risk.\\nUndoubtedly one of the most common pain relief\\nmethods during labor is the epidural. This technique in-\\nvolves the injection of anesthetic medication through a\\ncatheter into the epidural space in the back. Epidurals\\noften provide excellent relief of pain from contractions,\\nepisiotomy, and perineal repair. They do not impair the\\nmother’s mental alertness, although she may sleep if labor\\nto that point has been long and arduous. The disadvan-\\ntages of epidurals include possible prolonging of labor,\\nimpaired ability to push, inability to move around, possi-\\nble need for bladder catheterization and accompanying\\nrisk of infection or injury, maternal low blood pressure,\\nmaternal fever, spinal headache from inadvertent injec-\\ntion into the subdural space, and patchy or ineffective\\nblocks. Low blood pressure can result in nausea and\\ndizziness, as well as fetal distress. Supplemental oxygen\\nmay be given to the mother to alleviate this effect. Allergic\\nreactions to the anesthetic agents occur rarely. The woman\\nwho wishes to have an epidural needs to have IV access,\\nIV fluids in advance to help prevent low blood pressure,\\nand fetal monitoring. The woman’s inability to move\\naround and change positions because of the tubes and\\nwires can impede the progress of labor. If labor slows, it\\nmay be augmented by the injection of pitocin. Assisted\\ndelivery via forceps or vacuum extractor may be neces-\\nsary if the mother finds herself unable to push effectively.\\nInjectable narcotic pain medications are also avail-\\nable. They can be given by either intramuscular (IM) or\\nintravenous (IV) routes. When given intravenously, the ef-\\nfects are felt sooner and are shorter in duration. These\\nmedications are more likely to affect the fetus, and are\\ngenerally not given late in labor. Some women say that\\ntheir pain is not greatly diminished, but that they are better\\nable to rest between contractions. Others experience side\\neffects, such as nausea, vomiting, and dizziness that they\\nfeel negate any benefit that they get from the medication.\\nPrevention\\nTechniques that are used to prevent pregnancy are\\nknown as contraception. Some methods require a prescrip-\\ntion, including those involving hormones, diaphragms, cer-\\nvical caps, or intrauterine devices (IUDs). Hormonal birth\\ncontrol is available as a daily pill, an injection, or an im-\\nplant. Consultation with a health care professional will de-\\ntermine the appropriateness of these methods. Conditions\\nincluding clotting diseases,breast cancer, and liver dis-\\nease will preclude hormonal forms of birth control. Signifi-\\ncant side effects may occur even in women who are good\\ncandidates for these methods. Timing of taking the daily\\nbirth control pills is important, and back-up methods\\nshould be available if doses are missed. Diaphragms and\\ncaps are both barriers used next to the cervix along with a\\nspermicide. For both methods, there is a pregnancy rate be-\\ntween 8% and 27% in the first year. The IUD is a uniquely\\nlong-term device. It is placed by a medical professional,\\nand depending on the type, can retain effectiveness for as\\nlong as 10 years. It is not recommended for women who\\nhave ever had pelvic inflammatory disease, or for those\\nwho are not in a mutually monogamous relationship. The\\npregnancy rate in the first year for IUD users is around 3%.\\nSeveral popular forms of birth control are nonpre-\\nscriptive. Barrier method materials, such as condoms,\\nfoam, and spermicides are available over the counter.\\nCondoms have the distinction of being the only type de-\\nsigned for males. Used correctly, they are highly effec-\\ntive in preventing pregnancy. They have no side effects,\\nand latex varieties have the additional advantage of pro-\\nviding some protection against sexually transmitted dis-\\neases. Average pregnancy rates are around 12%.\\nPeriodic abstinence, sometimes called natural fami-\\nly planning, requires training and attentiveness to physi-\\ncal signs. A variety of methods are available, and may in-\\nclude monitoring of cycle days, basal body temperature,\\ncervical mucus characteristics, and other symptoms re-\\nlated to the timing of ovulation. Effectiveness can be as\\ngreat as 93%, but it requires significant commitment for\\nthe couple to faithfully monitor signs and abstain from\\nintercourse for at least one week of every cycle. Women\\nwith irregular cycles or unreliable signs have the most\\nunplanned pregnancies with these methods.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLevchuck, Caroline M., Jane Kelly Kosek, and Michele Dro-\\nhan. “Certified Nurse-Midwife.” In Healthy Living.

He\\ncreated food tables with data on protein, fat, carbohy-\\ndrate, mineral matter, and fuel value for common foods.\\nFood guides with food groups similar to those used\\ntoday first appeared in USDA publications in 1916 and\\nwere developed by nutrition specialist Caroline L. Hunt.\\nInterestingly, the first daily food guide was published\\nunder the title Food for Young Children . In the early\\n1930s, the Depression caused economic restraints on\\nfamilies and the USDA responded with advice on how to\\nselect healthy foods more cheaply. In 1941, the Food and\\nNutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences re-\\nleased the first recommended dietary allowances (RDAs)\\nfor calories and essential nutrients. The nine nutrients in-\\ncluded on the list were protein,iron, calcium, vitamins\\nA, C, and D, thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin.\\nThroughout the years following the release of the\\nfirst guidelines, recommendations were debated and re-\\nvised. The new food guide was first presented in 1984 as\\na food wheel.

Behavioral problems\\nhave even been associated with a lack of natural light, in-\\nsofar as light plays a vital role in the metabolism of calci-\\num, a mineral widely regarded as ‘nature’s tranquilizer.’”\\nBased on these statistics and many more that she\\ncites, Colbin contends that proper nutrition plays a key\\nrole in disease prevention. She indicates that she sees\\nthree major errors in our contemporary assumptions\\nabout health and illness: the belief that physiological\\nsymptoms such as headaches, fevers, etc. are mistaken\\nreactions of the body to normal stimuli; the belief that\\nsurgical intervention or chemical substances, natural or\\nartificial in origin, can restore health by stopping the dis-\\nease process; and the belief that dietary habits are unre-\\nlated to symptoms or illnesses. Although the last belief is\\nslowly changing, it has a long way to go. For example,\\nshe points out, many people are still buying antacids for\\ndigestive distress without changing their diet.\\nBenefits\\nThe Food Guide Pyramid and other healthy eating\\nrecommendations generally apply to children age two\\nand older. When used as a starting point for planning\\nfamily meals and snacks, applying these sensible recom-\\nmendations to children’s daily diets can encourage good\\neating habits at an early age. This will help children de-\\nvelop mentally and physically according to growth charts\\nand other measurements set by pediatricians (physicians\\nwho specialize in caring for children) and will help pre-\\nvent future problems with overeating or with eating disor-\\nders. Many nutritional experts agree that if children eat a\\nbalanced diet that includes all of the recommended food\\ngroups, they will not need to take vitamin/mineral supple-\\nments. Also, eating a balanced diet with a variety of foods\\nwill give children the energy they need to stay physically\\nactive, which is important to their growth and mental\\nhealth, and in keeping obesity in check.\\nDescription\\nIn spite of recommendations, the diet quality of\\nmost children is not what it should be. The USDA sur-\\nveyed American children ages two to nine in 1998 and\\nfound that up to 8% of them had a poor diet, while as\\nmany as 80% of those ages seven to nine had a diet that\\nneeded improvement. The Centers for Disease Control\\n(CDC) defines childhood obesity at a level above the\\n95th percentile of body mass index for his or her age\\ngroup. Body mass index (BMI) is a measurement system\\nused to assess if a child (or adult) is underweight, over-\\nweight, or at risk for becoming overweight. Pediatricians\\nuse height and weight measurements taken at a child’s\\nregular checkups to determine his or her BMI. To help\\nguide parents and others in making good nutritional\\nchoices to keep BMI in line with normal growth and just\\nto keep children healthy, the American Medical Associa-\\ntion (AMA) suggests the following food choices for chil-\\ndren, based on the USDA guidelines.\\nChildren two to five years of age\\nThe AMA and USDA recommend food guidelines\\nfor young children similar to those for older children and\\nadults, but with smaller portions.

Daily\\nrecommendations include:\\n• four to five servings of breads, cereals, rice, pasta\\n• two or more servings of vegetables\\n• two or more servings of fruit\\n• three to four servings of dairy products\\n• two or three servings of meat, fish, poultry, legumes\\n(beans, lentils, peas)\\nAfter age two, a child needs less fat than an infant—\\nabout 30% of daily calories. After age three, fiber be-\\ncomes more important in a child’s diet and can impact\\nfuture heart health.\\nCalcium requirements steadily increase as children\\nget older, from 500 mg a day at age three to 800 mg a\\nday at age four to eight. There is more calcium in the\\nbody than any other mineral. Calcium works together\\nwith phosphorus (two parts calcium to one part phospho-\\nrus) for healthy bones and teeth and works together with\\nmagnesium(two parts calcium to slightly over one part\\nmagnesium) to prevent cardiovascular (blood vessels of\\nthe heart) and other degenerative diseases. In order for\\ncalcium to be absorbed by the body, it must also have\\nsufficient amounts of vitamins C, D and A. In addition to\\nfood sources, an hour of sunshine each day can also pro-\\nvide a child with his/her daily vitamin D requirement.\\nChildren six to twelve years of age\\nBy the time children reach age five or six, they\\nbegin to tell parents what foods they like. Parents and\\nthose who care for the children can help select foods\\nfrom each recommended group that a child will enjoy.\\nCalorie requirements and portion sizes increase as chil-\\ndren get older: between ages six and ten, boys and girls\\nneed between 1,600 and 2,400 calories each day. Be-\\ncause of puberty and adolescent growth, between ages\\n10 and 12, girls need about 200 more calories a day.\\nBoys will begin needing about 500 more calories a day\\nafter age 12. The following servings per day are recom-\\nmended for children ages six to twelve:\\n• six to 11 servings of breads, cereals, rice, pasta\\n• three to five servings of vegetables\\n• two to four servings of fruit\\n• three or four servings of dairy products\\n• two or three servings of meat, fish, poultry, legumes\\nBy age six, children still need only about 30% of\\ncalories from fat. Nutritionists say that by adding five to\\nthe child’s age, parents can estimate the number of fiber\\ngrams a child needs each day. Calcium requirements\\ncontinue to rise, from 800 mg a day at ages four to eight\\nto 1,300 mg each day for children beginning at age nine.\\nPreparations\\nGetting children to eat the right foods is easy if they\\nbegin good eating habits at a young age and if they are of-\\nfered a variety of healthy foods. Many books, magazines,\\nand web sites offer tips on making healthy foods interest-\\ning. Some suggestions for each food group follow.\\n• breads, cereals, and pastas including whole grain\\nbreads, unsweetened cereals, unrefined rice, whole\\ngrain crackers, cornbread, rice cakes\\n• vegetable servings from cooked or raw vegetables such\\nas asparagus, beets, broccoli, carrots, corn, green and\\nred peppers, green beans, kale, peas, pumpkin, squash,\\nsweet potato, tomato, zucchini, or vegetable juice\\n• good fruit choices such as apples, applesauce, bananas,\\ncantaloupe, apricots, peaches, unsweetened fruit cock-\\ntail, plums, grapefruit, kiwi, nectarines, strawberries,\\nwatermelon, and fresh fruit juices\\n• milk, low-fat yogurts and cheeses are good dairy\\nsources, as are low-fat cottage cheese, custard, ice\\nmilk, and occasional ice cream servings\\n• meat, fish, poultry, and legume choices include lean\\nmeats, dried beans, peanut butter, shellfish, dried peas,\\nlentils, tofu, and reduced-fat cold cuts\\nTo reduce fat in a child’s diet, parents can switch to\\nlow-fat or non-fat milk; remove skin from poultry or trim\\nfat from red meat; reduce use of margarine and butter;\\nuse low-fat cooking methods such as baking, broiling,\\nand steaming; and serve foods rich in fiber. Fresh salads\\ncan improve fiber in diet, as can adding oat or wheat\\nbran to baked foods. Good, easy-to-assimilate sources of\\ncalcium for children, besides milk and cheeses, are tofu\\nmade with calcium sulfate; soup made with fish, fowl or\\nbeef bones and one tablespoon of wine vinegar to draw\\nout the calcium into the broth; canned salmon and sar-\\ndines with bones; sesame seeds and tahini (ground\\nsesame seed butter); beans and nuts; calcium-fortified\\nfresh orange juice; greens, especially broccoli, collards,\\nkale, mustard, turnip tops, parsley, watercress and dande-\\nlion; and cooked sea vegetables if children like them.\\nIn Food and Healing, Annemarie Colbin explains\\nwhat sugar is and why it causes so much damage to the\\nhealth of children and adults. White sugar, like white rice\\nand white flour, goes through an industrial refining\\nprocess: its juice is extracted from sugar cane, then fil-\\ntered and boiled until it has been separated from all of its\\nwater, minerals, vitamins, protein and fiber, all of which\\nthe body needs to digest and metabolize the sugar. Be-\\ncause it lacks those nutrients, refined sugar becomes\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 441\\nChildhood nutrition\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 441'),\n",

Thus when refined white sugar is\\nconsumed, there is loss of stored B vitamins, calcium,\\nphosphorus, iron, and other nutrients from the body. The\\nloss of calcium stored in teeth weakens them and makes\\nthem more susceptible to bacterial attack/cavities. Also,\\nthis nutrient loss from refined sugar consumption can\\nproduce hunger for the missing nutrients and provoke\\ngreat sugar-eating binges. On food labels, sugar is often\\nidentified as lactose, maltose, fructose, sucrose, and oth-\\ners. Glucose is the name of sugar found in the blood.\\nColbin points out that if you eat meat, you need to\\ndigestively balance it with white sugar and vice versa,\\nand that serious problems arise when the amount of\\nsugar eaten is more than the amount needed to balance\\nthe meat. Sugar is as addictive as a drug because eating a\\nsmall amount creates a desire for more sugar and be-\\ncause quitting sugar “cold turkey” brings on withdrawal\\nsymptoms that can last for an extended period of time.\\nTypical withdrawal symptoms include strong cravings,\\nfatigue, depression, mood swings, and sometimes\\nheadaches. Excessive sugar consumption is believed to\\nbe involved in such very common problems as hypo-\\nglycemia or hyperinsulinism, diabetes, heart disease,\\ndental caries, high cholesterol, obesity, indigestion, my-\\nopia (nearsightedness), seborrheic dermatitis, gout, ge-\\nnetic narrowing of pelvic and jaw structures, crowding\\nand malformation of teeth, hyperactivity, lack of concen-\\ntration, depression, and anxiety. Colbin notes that these\\nproblems result when the sugar intake provides more\\n“naked carbohydrates” than are needed to balance the\\nanimal protein intake. Since white flour also provides\\nadditional “naked carbohydrates,” only a small amount\\nof sugar can create an excess amount in the body.\\nIt is important that children eat three meals a day\\nand not skip breakfast. Studies have shown that children\\nand teens that skip breakfast have more trouble concen-\\ntrating, do not perform as well in school, and often have\\nlater problems with heart disease. Obesity is common in\\nchildren who skip breakfast.\\nWhile the obesity problem in today’s youth can be\\nblamed on a number of factors, including larger food\\nportions for adults and children, convenient salty and\\nsugary snack foods, and cheap and convenient fast food,\\nmuch attention has been focused on the role of the na-\\ntion’s schools. There are fewer physical education class-\\nes because of more emphasis on academic classes and\\nthose gym classes that remain have too much standing\\naround and not enough activities that interest the chil-\\ndren, say some experts. School lunches generally have\\nnot provided healthy or balanced nutrition but instead\\nhave consisted of highly refined, processed foods that\\nare full of additives and simple carbohydrates, which do\\nnot provide good nutrition or energy. In addition, many\\nschools also offer “snack bars” or vending machines\\nwith sodas and sugary, fatty, or salty snacks. Many chil-\\ndren have been choosing these snacks over the prepared\\nschool lunches.\\nTo counter this problem in schools, the Healthy\\nSchools Summit was held in October 2002. It consisted\\nof representatives from more than 30 national education,\\nfitness, nutrition, and health organizations, as well as 450\\nschool administrators, government leaders, food service\\ndirectors, counselors, dietitians, nurses, and health and\\nfitness teachers. Since that time, many school districts\\naround the country have been working to improve their\\nphysical education programs and to remove or change the\\nselections in vending machines and snack bars on school\\ncampuses. Parents can check with their children’s schools\\nor pack healthy lunches from home with foods their chil-\\ndren like to ensure they eat well while at school.\\nChildren who are very active and participate in orga-\\nnized sports need a particularly healthy diet. For extended\\nenergy, they should eat many complex carbohydrates, such\\nas unrefined rice, whole grain pasta and bread, and whole\\ngrain cereal. While all children need to drink plenty of\\nwater, those who participate in sports need to drink even\\nmore. Some experts say an easy formula to remember is\\none cup of fluid for every one-half hour of physical activity.\\nAt home, some parents choose convenient snack and\\nfast foods because often, both parents work long hours.\\nAlong with bigger portions and increased time spent in\\nfront of the television instead of out being physically ac-\\ntive, today’s youth are becoming obese from receiving\\nand growing accustomed to less nutritional foods. Many\\nexperts say that getting children up off the couch and\\nwatching their snack choices helps. Also, many sources\\ncan help parents find healthier alternatives to fast food\\nmeals for their families. Suggestions include cooking\\nhealthy meals on weekends and freezing them for busy\\nweekdays and looking for cookbooks or online sources\\nof quick and healthy recipes. Simply cooking with less\\nfat and using baking, roasting or poaching methods in-\\nstead of frying helps children and adults. Also, offering\\nchildren healthy snacks to last them until mealtime will\\nkeep them from reaching for poor snack choices and\\nmake them less likely to overeat at the evening meal.\\nFor a variety of reasons, some children follow vege-\\ntarian diets. Some people are concerned that a vegetarian\\ndiet is harmful for children, but generally, if a child aged\\ntwo or older still follows the recommended Food Guide\\nPyramid and makes good food choices, a vegetarian diet\\ncan be healthy. In fact, 2% of children ages six to 17\\nnever eat meat, fish, or poultry.

Offering a variety of healthy choices allows chil-\\ndren to select favorite foods from among those that are\\ngood for them and to balance foods containing a number\\nof vitamins and minerals. Research in 2004 showed that\\ntaste for certain foods probably develops while people are\\nstill infants. In fact, infants in the study who had been ex-\\nposed to the flavor of carrots through their mothers’\\nbreast milk later ate more of a carrot-flavored cereal that\\nthose who had not been exposed to carrots as infants. The\\nresearchers said that encouraging children to eat more\\nfruits and vegetables as early as possible was helpful.\\nMany physicians and medical researchers have cau-\\ntioned parents not to turn to fad diets for their children’s\\nweight problems. Many of the diets and diet products on\\nthe market have not been proven by clinical studies to be\\neffective in the long term for adults and therefore they\\ncertainly have not been proven safe or effective as a solu-\\ntion to weight problems in children. The best solution for\\nchildhood obesity is a combination of activity, a bal-\\nanced diet that follows the AMA/USDA guidelines for\\nfood groups and portions, and involvement of a physi-\\ncian, dietician, or other trained professional as needed. A\\nfurther caution concerning dieting is the concern that as\\nyoung children enter adolescence, too much worry about\\nweight and appearance can cause social anxieties and\\nlead to eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia.\\nWhen changing a young child’s diet, it should be\\ndone slowly, particularly when introducing fiber, and\\nwith the help of a physician, dietician, or nutritionist Too\\nmuch fiber can interfere with the body’s absorption of\\nvitamins and minerals.\\nChildren who do not eat enough food and do not get\\nenough nutrition suffer from severe undernourishment,\\nor malnutrition. Each year, more than six million chil-\\ndren under the age of five years die around the world as a\\nresult of hunger. Malnutrition also can make a child\\nmore susceptible to a number of diseases. Worldwide, it\\nis estimated that food insecurity affects 815 million\\nhouseholds, mostly in developing countries. However, in\\n2003, a report showed that at least 10% of U.S. house-\\nholds also don’t have enough food and about 3% report\\nhunger at home. In this case, it is not the sort of hunger a\\nperson feels when they eat a late lunch but the kind of\\npainful sensation someone gets from repeated or invol-\\nuntary lack of food.\\nThere are parents and health professionals, both tra-\\nditional and alternative, who feel children should have\\nvitamin/mineral supplements to stay healthy. However,\\nthere are also parents and health professionals who be-\\nlieve that when children eat a balanced diet of whole-\\nsome foods, they seldom need vitamin supplements; that\\nindividual vitamins and minerals should be taken, like\\nmedicine, when a deficiency has been created by a diet\\nimbalance; and that when such a deficiency has been\\ncorrected, they should be discontinued.\\nIf children are not eating a healthy diet and are being\\ngiven a vitamin/mineral supplement, it is important to\\nkeep chewable vitamins out of reach of young children,\\nas their appealing taste may be irresistible and dosage\\nneeds to be controlled according to directions. Children\\nwith poor appetites or erratic eating habits also may bene-\\nfit from vitamins and minerals. It is best to check with a\\npediatrician, dietician or nutritionist for dosing.\\nSome parents and health professionals feel that veg-\\netarian children may benefit from vitamin/mineral sup-\\nplementation because they may lack some iron and zinc\\nnormally obtained through meat products and/or fish.\\nOther substantial sources of iron are eggs, whole-grain\\nbreads and cereals, leafy and other vegetables, potatoes,\\nfruit and milk. Foods containing vitamin C (broccoli,\\nBrussels sprouts, collards, kale, parsley, sweet peppers,\\nstrawberries, grapefruit, melons, tangerines, potatoes,\\nand more) will increase absorption of iron in non-animal\\nfoods. Vegetarian sources of zinc are eggs, legumes, and\\nwhole grains. Zinc deficiency has been found in popula-\\ntions whose intake is derived solely from cereal sources,\\nbut in recent studies, vegetarians had adequate zinc lev-\\nels. Those children who avoid dairy products, although it\\nis difficult to get enough, may get calcium from broccoli,\\nleafy green vegetables like kale, canned salmon and sar-\\ndines including the bones, and soy products. If a child’s\\nphysician or qualified nutritionist feels a supplement is\\nnecessary, he/she should recommend the dosage.\\nChildren often don’t recognize feelings of thirst and\\nhave to be encouraged to drink before becoming thirsty.\\nIf a child’s urine is clear or the color of pale lemonade,\\nhe or she is drinking enough fluids.

Both the beneficial and adverse ef-\\nfects of exceeding this amount are controversial. Over-\\ndosing of vitamin D is irreversible and may be fatal.\\nSymptoms of too much vitamin D are nausea, loss of ap-\\npetite, headache,diarrhea, fatigue, restlessness, and cal-\\ncification of the soft tissues (insoluble lime salts in tis-\\nsue) of the lungs and the kidneys, as well as the bones.”\\nVitamin D (400 IU) is usually sold with vitamin A\\n(5,000 IU) in a tiny tablet or capsule.\\nLieberman and Bruning say that active vitamin A\\nfrom fish liver oil or synthetic palmitate is stored in the\\nliver; that 15,000 IU would cause problems in infants;\\nbut that 100,000 IU of active vitamin A would have to be\\ntaken daily for months before any signs of toxicity (state\\nof being poisonous) appear. Vitamin A in the form of\\nbeta-carotene can be taken without any risk of toxicity.\\nAt doses of 800–1,200 IU per day, Lieberman/Brun-\\ning found no well-documented toxicity of vitamin E. At\\ndoses of over 1,200 IU per day, adverse effects such as\\nflatulence, diarrhea,nausea, headache, heart palpita-\\ntions, and fainting have been reported, but were com-\\npletely reversible when dosage was reduced.\\nVitamin K is easily obtained by the body from a\\nhealthy diet and deficiencies are rare, especially in chil-\\ndren. It is given prophylactically to newborn infants to\\nprevent hemorrhage and before surgery to people with\\nblood-clotting problems. Lieberman/Bruning describe\\nthe major effect of too much vitamin K as an anemia\\nwhere red blood cells die more quickly than usual and\\ncannot be replaced by the body.\\nSome children have severe food allergies. It is im-\\nportant to watch for signs of allergies in very young chil-\\ndren in particular, since they are eating many foods for\\nthe first time. Signs of food allergies can range from\\nmild to severe. A child may, for instance, eat peanuts or\\nshellfish and immediately show signs of a severe reac-\\ntion, such as swelling and trouble breathing. Other food\\nallergies may be less obvious but may occur from com-\\nmon foods found in many everyday products such as\\nmilk, eggs, wheat, or soy. If a child appears to have a se-\\nvere reaction and has trouble breathing, the parent or\\ncaregiver should seek immediate medical attention, since\\nthe allergic reaction may be serious. If a child has ongo-\\ning problems such as eczema or other allergic reactions\\nor signs of intolerance to foods, the parent may choose to\\nseek help from a registered dietician and/or an allopathic\\nphysician who specializes in allergies. The allopathic\\nphysician may test the child first to determine the source\\nof the allergies. The dietician will work with the family\\nto help plan ways to meet nutritional needs while avoid-\\ning foods that cause allergic reaction or intolerance.\\nThe parent of an allergic child can also choose to\\nseek help from a homeopathic or naturopathic physician.\\nAndrew Weil, M.D., author of Spontaneous Healing, a\\nNew York Times number one bestseller that sold well\\nover one million copies, believes that the body can heal\\nitself and believes allergies are learned responses of the\\nimmune system to environmental agents that are not nec-\\nessarily harmful. Weil says treatment should focus on\\ncalming an over-reactive immune system in order to alle-\\nviate allergy symptoms. Allergies can and are frequently\\n“healed.” However, traditional allergy medications tend\\nto be “more or less” toxic to the body and can increase\\nan allergic response over time.\\nTo increase the likelihood of spontaneous healing,\\nDr. Weil made the following recommendations. Dietary\\nmodification to reduce allergic responses: following a\\nlow-protein diet; cutting down on animal protein in gen-\\neral; eliminating cow’s milk and products made from it\\nbecause they are known to irritate the immune system;\\nand eating organically grown foods as much as possible\\nto avoid agricultural chemicals that cause immune system\\nreaction. Regular use of quercetin, a natural product from\\nbuckwheat and citrus fruits, that stabilizes cell mem-\\nbranes that release histamine, which is involved in many\\nallergic reactions. Quercetin is a preventative and Dr.\\nWeil recommends it be used regularly. The recommended\\ndose is 400 mg twice a day between meals. For hay fever,\\nthe freeze-dried extract of the herb stinging nettle, one to\\ntwo capsules every two to four hours as needed, he says\\nwill control symptoms with none of the toxicity of anti-\\nhistamines or steroids. He also recommends a safe nasal\\nspray, Nasalcrom, which works like quercetin. In the\\nhome, environmental methods like installing air filters\\ncan reduce allergic effects on and relieve the immune sys-\\ntem. And finally, some allergic reactions indicate that\\nhigh brain levels are involved in misdirected immune sys-\\ntem response, and mind/body intervention is suggested.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThe AMA has based many of its food choices on the\\nDietary Guidelines for Americans, which were developed\\nthrough research by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2444\\nChildhood nutrition\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 444'),\n",

A 2003 study\\nfrom the American Dietetic Association reported that\\npreteens and their parents weren’t concerned about pre-\\nteens’ weight being a health risk. Children and parents\\nrelated obesity more to food than to physical activity and\\nmany overweight children said they didn’t have much\\nopportunity for physical activity.\\nTraining & certification\\nQualified dieticians and nutritionists may have a\\nbachelor’s, master’s or a doctoral degrees in nutrition\\nand dietetics from an accredited college. They also are\\nrequired to constantly update their knowledge with con-\\ntinuing education. Through the American Dietetic Asso-\\nciation, these professionals can gain certification in their\\nfields, including a certificate of training in childhood and\\nadolescent weight management. Pediatricians obtain\\nM.D. or D.O degrees and some specialize in childhood\\ndiseases and treatment. In the field of alternative medi-\\ncine, parents may choose to seek treatment from natur-\\nopaths and homeopaths.\\nAndrew Weil, M.D. in Spontaneous Healing points\\nout the benefits of naturopathic medicine by saying that\\nnaturopaths go beyond the impression that they are ‘New\\nAge.’ “Naturopathy comes from the old tradition of Eu-\\nropean health spas with their emphasis hydro (water)\\ntherapy, massage, and nutritional and herbal treatment.”\\nNaturopaths are well trained in the sciences and have\\nmore experience with nutritional and herbal medicine\\nthat allopathic physicians may not have. Naturopathy is\\nbased on a general philosophy that focuses on the body’s\\nnatural healing potential in an attempt to circumvent the\\nuse of drugs and surgery; however, naturopathic physi-\\ncians may focus on different styles, using such therapies\\nas acupuncture, bodywork, herbalism, and homeopathy.\\nThey are licensed in only a few states in the United\\nStates, mostly in the West. According to Dr. Weil, “Good\\nnaturopaths are worth consulting for childhood illnesses,\\nrecurrent upper respiratory infections and sinusitis, gy-\\nnecological problems, and all ailments for which con-\\nventional doctors have only suppressive treatments.\\nNaturopaths can be valuable as advisors to help people\\ndesign healthy lifestyles.” To find a naturopathic physi-\\ncian in their area, parents can contact the American As-\\nsociation of Naturopathic Physicians, 601 Valley Street,\\nSuite 105, Seattle, Washington 98109, (206) 298-0126.\\nWith regard to homeopathy, Dr. Weil also has positive\\nfeedback for the discipline. Homeopathy is a system that\\nhas a two hundred year old history. Homeopaths use dilut-\\ned natural remedies work on the body’s energy field to en-\\ncourage healing. Homeopathic physicians can be M.D.s,\\nosteopaths, naturopaths, chiropractors, or lay persons.

The condition is frequently\\nfound in females of reproductive age due to significant\\nmonthly blood loss during menses.\\n• Stress or poor health condition.\\n• Malnutrition. Poor diet and/or B-complex vitamin defi-\\nciency often makes a person more sensitive to cold\\ntemperature.\\n• Hypothyroidism . Hypothyroidism is one of the most\\ncommon reasons for cold intolerance in women.\\n• Diabetes.\\n• Poor immune function as in AIDS or cancer patients.\\nIn these patients, chills and shivering may be signs of\\ninfections(most likely), tumors, drug-induced fever, or\\nmalnutrition.\\n• Infections. Chills and fever are often caused by the\\ncommon cold or viral infections. However, they may\\nalso be due to something more serious such as cystitis\\n(bladder infection ), septicemia (blood infections),\\npneumonia, meningitis, malaria or tuberculosis.\\n• Medications. Certain medications such as beta interfer-\\nons can cause chills as side effect.\\n• Unknown infections or diseases.\\nDiagnosis\\nThose suffering from chills should investigate possi-\\nble causes if the symptoms persist or are accompanied\\nby fever and/or night sweat. They may be a sign or\\nsymptom of something serious and may require medical\\nattention. Doctor can make accurate diagnosis of under-\\nlying diseases through detailed questioning about the\\nchills, accompanying symptoms if any, patient’s diet,\\ndaily stress, and lifestyle. In addition, doctors may order\\nblood tests for anemia, hypothyroidism, or infections if\\nthese conditions are suspected.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2446\\nChills KEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAnorexia—An eating disorder that involves loss of\\nappetite that results in the inability to eat.\\nBulimia—Sometimes called binge eating, this eat-\\ning disorder consists of cravings for foods that\\noften result in periods of continuous eating fol-\\nlowed by purging (forced vomiting or diarrhea)\\nand depression or food-deprivation, etc.\\nGout—A metabolism defect resulting in overpro-\\nduction of uric acid and pain in one or a few joints.\\nhypoglycemia —A condition of abnormally low\\nblood sugar.\\nMalnutrition—Any disorder of nutrition caused by\\ninsufficient or unbalanced diet that can result in\\nimpaired absorption or use of foods.\\nMegavitamin therapy —Also called orthomolecu-\\nlar medicine, megavitamin therapy provides large\\ndoses of vitamins and minerals to treat certain\\nconditions or diseases.\\nSeborrheic dermatitis —A skin condition charac-\\nterized by loose, greasy, or dry white to yellowish\\nscales with or without reddened skin.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 446'),\n",

It grows 6-8 in (15-20 cm) tall and has\\nlong oval leaves that are covered with fine hairs, fluted\\nflowers that are reddish orange tinted with purple, and a\\nround fruit. The root is thick and reddish yellow. Chinese\\nfoxglove root is collected in the fall. Its Latin name is\\nRehmannia glutinosaand it is also called Rehmannia\\nchinensis.\\nGeneral use\\nIn China, Chinese foxglove root is used as a remedy\\nfor many different ailments: blurred vision, chronic fever,\\nconstipation, heart palpitations, hearing problems, hot\\nflashes, insomnia, light-headedness, low back pain ,\\nmenstrual irregularity and uterine bleeding (especially\\nafter childbirth), night sweats, restlessness, and stiff\\njoints. It is also used to combat the effects of aging. Its ef-\\nfectiveness in treating these ailments has not been verified.\\nPreparations\\nChinese foxglove root is washed and dried in the\\nsun. It is sold in large, fleshy brownish-yellow chunks\\nand tastes sweet and moist. The root is used in two stages\\nof preparation: dried and cooked. To make dried Chinese\\nfoxglove root, called sheng di huang or dry Rehmannia,\\nthe fresh root is removed from the sand, washed well,\\nthen dried in the sun during the winter. Cooked Chinese\\nfoxglove root, called shu di huang or cooked Rehmannia,\\nis prepared by steaming the fresh root until it is cooked,\\nletting it dry, then steaming and drying it again several\\ntimes. Cooking Chinese foxglove root is said to enhance\\nthe herb’s properties as a blood tonic. To combat the ef-\\nfects of aging, the root is prepared with cardamon so that\\nit is easier to digest and used as a tonic. The raw form of\\nthe root is a cooler herb and used for symptoms of heat.\\nThe cooked root is more of a blood tonic.\\nChinese medicine practitioners also make special\\npreparations of Chinese foxglove root for specific ail-\\nments. It can be mixed with gelatin for coughing and\\nvomitingblood, nosebleeds , and bleeding from the\\nuterus. It can be mixed with cornus and Chinese yam or\\nfreshwater turtle shell as a remedy for symptoms such as\\nforgetfulness, insomnia, and lightheadedness. Rehman-\\nnia is the main ingredient in the Chinese six flavor\\nRehmannia tonic used for ailments and discomfort such\\nas frequent urination,infertility , impotence , and weak\\nand painful knees.\\nBoth cooked Chinese foxglove root and the raw version\\nare available in Chinese pharmacies, Asian markets, and\\nsome Western health food stores. There are no formal guide-\\nlines for recommended doses of Chinese foxglove root.\\nPrecautions\\nPeople who have digestive problems, especially\\nthose who tend to have gas or become bloated, should\\nuse Chinese foxglove root with care; the cooked root can\\nswell the belly and cause loose stools. There is no infor-\\nmation available on what happens to people who take an\\noverdose of Chinese foxglove root.\\nSide effects\\nThe use of Chinese foxglove root can cause diar-\\nrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. Many Chinese\\nherbalists include grains-of-paradise fruit , a kind of\\ncardamon, in their Chinese foxglove root preparations to\\nprevent these side effects.\\nInteractions\\nNo interactions due to use of Chinese foxglove root\\nhave been reported.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nReid, D.

Chinese massage is holistic in\\nits orientation, which means that massage is understood\\nto affect the patient’s entire being, not just his or her\\nphysical body.\\nSeveral concepts are important in understanding all\\nthe major forms of Chinese massage, including qi, jing\\nluo, xue, and jin.\\nQi, sometimes spelled chi or ki, is the basic life en-\\nergy animating the universe as well as human beings.\\nThe word can be translated into English as “breath” or\\n“air.” Qi can be transferred or transmuted. In humans,\\nthe digestive tract extracts the qi from food, while the\\nlungs extract it from the air. When these two forms of qi\\nmeet in the bloodstream, they form human qi, which\\nthen circulates throughout the body.\\nThe meridians or channels ( jing luo) are a network\\nof energy pathways that link and balance the various or-\\ngans. The meridians have four functions: to connect the\\ninternal organs with the exterior of the body, and connect\\nthe person to the environment and the universe; to har-\\nmonize the yin and yang principles within the body’s or-\\ngans and Five Substances; to distribute qi within the\\nbody; and to protect the body against external imbal-\\nances related to weather. When the jing luo are blocked\\nso that qi and blood cannot circulate, the person experi-\\nences physical pain.\\nThe acupoints (xue) are locations on the body where\\nqi tends to collect and can be manipulated or redirected.\\nThey are connected to different body organs through the\\nmeridians.\\nThe soft and connective tissues ( jin) and the joints\\nall affect the flow of qi along the meridians. Thus one\\nfunction of Chinese massage is to relax the patient’s jin.\\nIn general, Chinese massage emphasizes movement\\nand communication. The basic purpose of massage is to\\nrestore free movement to the patient’s qi and blood. Chi-\\nOTHER\\nChina-Med.net.

In traditional Chinese practice, massage is\\none of the fundamental treatment modalities, along with\\ndietary regulation, herbal medicine, acupuncture/moxi-\\nbustion, and therapeutic exercise.\\nOrigins\\nMassage as a part of Chinese medical treatment\\ngoes back about 4,000 years. Written massage textbooks\\nbegan to appear as early as the fourth century B.C., along\\nwith the earliest Chinese medical texts. Massage appears\\nto have developed alongside both therapeutic exercise\\n(qigong) and acupuncture , as it depends on the same\\nunderstanding of the meridians and the flow of qi in the\\nhuman body. The type of massage known as qi healing,\\nor curing with external qi, was developed by master\\nteachers of qigong.\\nBenefits\\nChinese massage is not intended to be an experience\\nof pampering or relaxation . It is a form of deep tissue\\ntherapy that conveys the following benefits:\\n• speeding the healing of injuries and clearing bruises\\n• stimulating blood circulation and regulating the ner-\\nvous system\\n• removing scar tissue\\n• easing emotional distress\\n• curing some conditions affecting the internal organs\\n• increasing flexibility in the joints and improving posture\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 449\\nChinese massage\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nPalpitation —A heartbeat that is irregular or too\\nfast.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 449'),\n",

Since Chinese\\npractitioners regard massage as affecting all dimensions of\\nthe patient’s being, they think of it as involving communi-\\ncation between the therapist’s qi and the patient’s qi. In\\nTui namassage, the patient is allowed or even encouraged\\nto talk while the therapist is working. This practice often\\nhelps the patient to release stored-up feelings.\\nTui na massage\\nTui na massage takes its name from two Chinese\\nwords that mean “lift and press.” It requires the con-\\ntrolled use of very deep but constantly moving pres-\\nsure, repeated hundreds of times. The practitioner push-\\nes hard with the ball of the thumb, then rubs lightly\\naround the area being treated. A therapist using this\\nform of massage might spend as much time on one of\\nthe patient’s joints or limbs as a Western therapist\\nwould spend massaging the entire body. Tui na is used\\nto treat a wide variety of conditions that would require\\na team of physiotherapists, chiropractors, and physi-\\ncians specializing in sports medicine to treat in the\\nWest. One Chinese medical book lists over 140 condi-\\ntions that can be treated with Tui na , including disor-\\nders of the internal organs as well as sprains, pulled\\nmuscles, arthritis, and sciatica, a pain in the lower back\\nand back of the thighs.\\nChinese pediatric massage\\nChinese pediatric message, or xiao er tui na , is a\\nform of Tui na massage adapted to the special needs of\\nchildren from birth to 12 years of age. The Chinese be-\\nlieve that a child’s energy system is different from an\\nadult’s because children have fewer physical and emo-\\ntional barriers in place. Their qi is therefore more acces-\\nsible to treatment. The acupoints and techniques used in\\npediatric massage are different from those used with\\nadults. A massage oil, typically sesame oil, is often used\\nwith children. The sessions are much shorter than those\\nfor adults, usually only 15–20 minutes, but they may be\\nrepeated several times a day for children who are seri-\\nously ill. Pediatric massage is used to treat such chronic\\nconditions as asthma, bedwetting , and nightmares as\\nwell as teething, colic, nausea, fever, constipation, and\\nthe common cold . Parents often learn the basic tech-\\nniques of pediatric massage as preventive health care for\\ntheir children or to treat minor illnesses.\\nAn mo massage\\nAn mo is a type of massage used for health mainte-\\nnance and to restore vitality. Its name means “press and\\nstroke” in Chinese. It can be used at home but is also part\\nof martial arts, qigong, and athletic training. An mo dif-\\nfers from Tui na massage in that it is a full-body bal-\\nanced treatment. An mo combines yang techniques to\\nbreak up stagnant qi and activate its flow, followed by\\nyin techniques to soothe and calm the body. An mo has a\\nset pattern of movements and techniques that the thera-\\npist follows, but these can be adjusted to the patient’s\\nneeds. A session of An mo massage may last as long as\\ntwo hours, particularly if there is a strong qi communica-\\ntion between the therapist and the patient.\\nDian xue massage (acupressure)\\nDian xue, or “point press,” is familiar to many West-\\nerners as acupressure. It uses the same acupoints on the\\nbody as acupuncture, but relies on pressure from the fin-\\ngers rather than needles. Dian xue can be used by mas-\\nsage therapists to stimulate two different acupoints, one\\nwith each hand, while the area of the body between the\\npoints is stretched or twisted to maximize the flow of qi.\\nDian xuecan be given in the home, and is sometimes\\nused by acupuncturists when needles cannot be used.\\nQi healing massage\\nThe Chinese name of this form of massage is wai qi\\nliao fa , or “curing with external qi.” In qi healing, a\\nqigong master who has practiced the art for many years\\ntransmits qi directly to the patient. Qi healing massage\\nrepresents one strand of Chinese traditional practice in\\nwhich healers passed on their own discoveries of the\\nhealing arts only to their closest disciples.\\nPreparations\\nChinese massage is usually given with the patient\\nlying on one side on a couch or seated on a chair or\\nstool. The patient typically wears thin cotton clothing,\\nparticularly if the massage is being given in a public hos-\\npital or clinic. In smaller communities, the practitioner\\nmay work directly on the patient’s skin. Touching the\\nskin directly is thought to improve communication with\\nthe patient’s qi; it also allows the application of herbal\\npreparations to the skin.\\nTui na massage is preceded by taking a full case his-\\ntory using the traditional four examinations of Chinese\\nmedicine (verbal interview; visual observation, which in-\\ncludes close examination of the tongue; listening to the\\npatient’s breathing and coughing; and touching, which in-\\ncludes taking twelve separate pulses).

This dis-\\ncomfort usually goes away after several more sessions. Pe-\\ndiatric massage is said to have few or no side effects. On\\nrare occasions, patients have experienced headaches or mild\\nstomach upset. These side effects are attributed to the im-\\nbalance or stagnation in the patient’s qi prior to treatment.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nIn recent years, Chinese massage has become wide-\\nly accepted in the West. A growing number of Western\\npractitioners are not only studying Chinese massage, but\\nalso obtaining their training and certification in Shanghai\\nand other centers of traditional Chinese medical educa-\\ntion. Many alternative treatment centers in the United\\nStates now offer Chinese massage along with Western\\nforms of bodywork. Still another indication of the wider\\nacceptance of Chinese forms of treatment is the emer-\\ngence of hybrid massage therapies that combine Chinese\\ntechniques with those derived from other Oriental tradi-\\ntions of massage or from Western practices.\\nTraining & certification\\nIn China itself, massage is part of the curriculum of\\ntraditional Chinese schools of medicine, since it is an\\nimportant aspect of primary health care. Graduates of\\nthese schools must pass rigorous examinations and gov-\\nernment licensing procedures before setting up their\\npractices. In addition, it is common for Chinese physi-\\ncians to visit other practitioners as patients in order to\\nlearn about specialized techniques for treating specific\\nconditions with massage. Lastly, many Chinese physi-\\ncians come from families that have produced several\\ngenerations of healers; younger practitioners often learn\\nthe techniques of massage from older family members.\\nThe master/apprentice model of teaching is still followed\\nin traditional Chinese medical training.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nChinese Massage Therapy: A Handbook of Therapeutic Mas-\\nsage.

Diet is\\none of four major treatment modalities in traditional\\nChinese medicine , the other three being acupuncture/\\nmoxibustion, herbal medicine, and massage, plus reme-\\ndial physical exercise.\\nOrigins\\nThe selection of foods in the diet as part of a life-\\nlong program of health maintenance and treatment of ill-\\nness has been a part of Chinese medicine from its begin-\\nnings. The first extensive written Chinese medical trea-\\ntises (as the West understands the term) date from the\\nHan dynasty (206 B.C.–A.D. 220), but the use of food as\\npreventive medicine probably goes several thousand\\nyears further back. Legends says that tribal shamans and\\nholy men who lived as hermits in the mountains of China\\nas early as 3500 B.C. practiced what was called the “Way\\nof Long Life.” This regimen included a diet based on\\nherbs and other plants,qigong exercises, and special\\nbreathing techniques that were thought to improve vitali-\\nty and life expectancy.\\nAfter the Han dynasty, the next great age of Chinese\\nmedicine was under the Tang emperors, who ruled from\\nA.D. 608 to A.D. 906. The first Tang emperor established\\nChina’s first medical school in A.D. 629. This period pro-\\nduced China’s earliest expert on dietary therapy, Sun\\nSimiao. He specialized in the treatment of diseases\\ncaused by malnutrition and wrote several works on diet\\nand health. Sun Simaio’s principle of using diet and\\nlifestyle changes as the first line of treatment for illness\\nhas governed traditional Chinese practice ever since. Ac-\\ncording to Sun Simaio, only when dietary treatment is\\nnot enough to cure the patient should the doctor turn to\\nacupunctureand herbal medicines.\\nBenefits\\nThe benefits of traditional Chinese dietary treatment\\nare many years of vigorous good health. According to\\nthe Nei Jing , China’s oldest medical classic, the\\nmetaphor is that human beings are constituted to live for\\na hundred years, barring accidents or violence. Diet and\\ngood digestion are considered the most important ways\\nto maintain physical strength and vitality.\\nDescription\\nChinese food cures are based on the philosophical\\nprinciples of Taoism and its teachers’ observations about\\nnature. Some of its concepts are difficult for Westerners\\nto understand because they rely on symbols and images\\nrather than scientific measurements and theories. In gen-\\neral, Chinese medicine regards the human organism as\\nan integrated entity within itself and as linked to the fam-\\nily, society, and the natural order by a pattern of symbol-\\nic connections.\\nThe cosmic and natural order\\nIn early Chinese philosophy, the Tao, or universal\\nfirst principle, generated a duality of opposing principles\\nthat underlie all the patterns of nature. These principles,\\nyin and yang, are mutually dependent as well as polar\\nopposites. Yin represents everything that is cold, moist,\\ndim, responsive, slow, heavy, and moving downward or\\ninward; while yang represents heat, dryness, brightness,\\nactivity, rapidity, lightness, and upward or outward mo-\\ntion. The dynamic interaction of these two principles is\\nreflected in the cycles of the seasons, the human life\\ncycle, and other natural phenomena.\\nIn addition to yin and yang, Taoist teachers also be-\\nlieved that the Tao produced a third force, primordial en-\\nergy or chi (also spelled qi or ki, the Japanese term). The\\ninterplay between yin, yang, and chi gave rise to the Five\\nElements of water, wood, fire, earth, and metal. These\\nentities are all reflected in the structure and functioning\\nof the human body.\\nThe human being\\nTraditional Chinese physicians did not learn about\\nthe structures of the human body from dissection (al-\\nthough they did perform some animal studies) because\\nthey thought that cutting open a body insulted the per-\\nson’s ancestors. Instead they built up an understanding of\\nthe location and functions of the major organs over cen-\\nturies of observation, and then correlated them with the\\nprinciples of yin, yang, chi, and the Five Elements. Thus\\nwood is related to the liver (yin) and the gall bladder\\n(yang); fire to the heart (yin) and the small intestine\\n(yang); earth to the spleen (yin) and the stomach (yang);\\nmetal to the lungs (yin) and the large intestine (yang);\\nand water to the kidneys (yin) and the bladder (yang).\\nThe Chinese also believed that the body contains Five\\nEssential Substances, which include blood, spirit, vital\\nessence (a principle of growth and development pro-\\nduced by the body from chi and blood), fluids (all body\\nfluids other than blood, such as saliva, spinal fluid,\\nsweat, etc.), and chi.\\nA unique feature of traditional Chinese medicine is\\nthe meridian system. Chinese doctors viewed the body as\\nregulated by a network of energy pathways called meridi-\\nans that link and balance the various organs. The meridi-\\nans have four functions: to connect the internal organs\\nwith the exterior of the body, and connect the person to the\\nenvironment and the universe; to harmonize the yin and\\nyang principles within the body’s organs and Five Sub-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2452\\nChinese system of food cures\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 452'),\n",

It supplies nutritional energy to the body to re-\\nplenish chi. It is also used by the body to produce vital\\nessence and blood. Lastly, foods can be chosen to regu-\\nlate the balance of yin and yang and the five elements\\nwithin the body and to direct the flow of chi to different\\nparts of the body.\\nChinese medicine classifies foods according to four\\nsets of categories:\\n• Temperature. Foods are classified as cold or cool (yin);\\nor warm or hot (yang).\\n• Taste. There are five tastes correlated with the Five Ele-\\nments: sour (wood); bitter (fire); sweet (earth); pungent\\n(metal); and salty (water).\\n• Direction of action. Pungent, salty, and bland foods are\\nthought to have an ascending or floating action that\\nredirects chi upward, while sour, bitter, and sweet\\nfoods are thought to have a descending or sinking ac-\\ntion that moves the chi downward.\\n• The organ or meridian affected by the food.\\nChinese medicine uses foods to keep the body in in-\\nternal harmony and in a state of balance with the external\\nenvironment. In giving dietary advice, the Chinese\\nphysician takes into account the weather, the season, the\\ngeography of the area, and the patient’s specific imbal-\\nances (including emotional upsets) in order to select\\nfoods that will counteract excesses or supply deficient el-\\nements. Basic preventive dietary care, for example,\\nwould recommend eating yin foods in the summer,\\nwhich is a yang season. In the winter, by contrast, yang\\nfoods should be eaten to counteract the yin temperatures.\\nIn the case of illness, yin symptom patterns (fatigue ,\\npale complexion, weak voice) would be treated with\\nyang foods, while yang symptoms (flushed face, loud\\nvoice, restlessness) would be treated by yin foods. In ad-\\ndition, cravings for specific foods or flavors point to de-\\nficiencies to be remedied. Thus someone who wants a lot\\nof hot drinks probably has a “cold” illness, while some-\\none who refuses beverages has a “damp” disease.\\nChinese medicine also uses food as therapy in com-\\nbination with exercise and herbal preparations. One as-\\npect of a balanced diet is maintaining a proper balance of\\nrest and activity as well as selecting the right foods for\\nthe time of year and other circumstances. If a person\\ndoes not get enough exercise, the body cannot transform\\nfood into chi and vital essence. If they are hyperactive,\\nthe body consumes too much of its own substance. With\\nrespect to herbal preparations, the Chinese used tonics\\ntaken as part of a meal before they began to use them as\\nmedicines. Herbs are used in Chinese cooking to give the\\nfood specific medicinal qualities as well as to flavor it.\\nFor example,ginger might be added to a fish dish to\\ncounteract the cold of the fish. Food and medical treat-\\nment are closely interrelated in traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine. A classical Chinese meal seeks to balance not only\\nflavors, aromas, textures, and colors in the different\\ncourses that are served, but also the energies provided\\nfor the body by the various ingredients.\\nPreparations\\nA traditional Chinese physician will examine a pa-\\ntient carefully before giving advice about diet. The diag-\\nnosis is based on four types of examination: visual ob-\\nservation, which includes examining the shape, color,\\nand coating of the tongue as well as observing the com-\\nplexion and taking the pulse; listening to the voice and\\nbreathing; inquiring about the patient’s symptoms, food\\npreferences, emotions, bowel habits, and sleeping pat-\\nterns; and palpating (feeling) the patient’s abdomen and\\nkey points along the meridians. The doctor will suggest\\nchanges in diet that will return the patient to inner bal-\\nance and harmony with the environment according to the\\npatterns he detects.\\nPrecautions\\nThe most important precaution for Westerners who\\nare interested in Chinese food therapy is to consult an\\nexperienced practitioner of Chinese medicine. The sys-\\ntem is complex and based on principles that differ from\\nWestern systems of thought. These factors make self-\\nevaluation quite difficult.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects from using the Chi-\\nnese system of food cures as part of a wellness program\\nunder the guidance of an experienced practitioner.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nResearch in the West has been largely confined to\\nstudy of the herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine\\nas distinct from food cures.

It grows naturally in\\nChina, Japan, and Korea, and in other countries in north-\\nern Asia and northern Europe. The root of the plant is\\npale red, and is the part that is used medicinally. It tastes\\nslightly bitter and pungent, and is believed to have cool-\\ning properties in the body.\\nOne of the major herbs in traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine, Chinese thoroughwax is used in several traditional\\nformulas for liver problems, fevers, and inflammation.\\nChinese herbalists prescribe it for conditions that are as-\\nsociated with stagnation of qi, or chi (life energy) in the\\nliver. Chinese thoroughwax is a major ingredient in a\\nwidely used Oriental medicinal formula called in Japan-\\nese shosaikoto , which also contains Korean ginseng ,\\nlicorice root, ginger root, and other herbs. The Chinese\\nname for the formula is xiao chai hu tang. This formula\\nis almost 2,000 years old and is used for situations when\\nsomeone gets a old or flu but never quite gets completely\\nbetter, like some kinds of chronic fatigue syndrome.\\nBupleurum has received attention most recently by re-\\nsearchers in China and Japan. Several studies that have\\nshown significant findings have been translated into Eng-\\nlish.

In laboratory tests, saikogenin has shown potent\\nanti-inflammatory properties, which recommend it for\\ntreating skin infections and other disorders in which in-\\nflammation and swelling are problematic. Saikogenin has\\nbeen shown to increase the effectiveness of cortisone\\ndrugs, which are pharmaceutical steroids prescribed for\\narthritis,asthma, inflammation and other conditions. Bu-\\npleurum significantly increased the action of the cortisone\\ndrug prednisone in some laboratory tests. Another benefit\\nof bupleurum is that it has been shown to protect the adren-\\nal glands from the damaging effects of cortisone drugs.\\nBupleurum extract has been shown in human studies\\nto improve the symptoms of hepatitis, or viral infection\\nof the liver. Other studies have pointed to its effective-\\nness as an antipyretic (fever-reducing agent), a mild tran-\\nquilizer, an antibiotic and antiviral agent, and as an im-\\nmune system stimulant. A Japanese study published in\\n2002 suggests that bupleurum may be effective in the\\ntreatment of gastric ulcers. Chinese thoroughwax has\\nalso been shown to increase the efficiency of the\\nchemotherapy drug 5-FU. It should be noted that Chi-\\nnese thoroughwax has been generally most effective in\\ntests when used in conjunction with other herbs in tradi-\\ntional Chinese herbal formulas.\\nGeneral use\\nTraditional Chinese medicine recommends Chinese\\nthoroughwax for chest congestion, respiratory problems,\\nand for chills and fevers, including those associated with\\nmalaria and blackwater fever. It is used to treat fevers\\nthat have associated symptoms of bitter taste in the\\nmouth, irritability,nausea, and abdominal pains, and is\\nsometimes prescribed for dizziness and vertigo that\\noccur with chest pain. Chinese thoroughwax is used in\\ntonics to strengthen the lungs and sense organs, and to\\ntone the leg muscles. Chinese thoroughwax is used to\\nstrengthen the liver and to treat liver problems, such as\\nhepatitis and alcohol-related liver damage (cirrhosis).\\nFor women, Chinese thoroughwax is used in formu-\\nlas to regulate menstrual cycles in cases of amenorrhea\\n(loss of menstrual cycle), to reduce the symptoms of\\nPMS, and as a tonic for the female reproductive system.\\nChinese thoroughwax can be taken as an herbal supple-\\nment with corticosteroid drugs, to reduce the risks of\\ndamage to the adrenal glands. Some Chinese medicinal\\nformulas containing Chinese thoroughwax (including\\nxiao chai hu tang) are used for cancer treatment and as\\nherbal support during chemotherapy.\\nPreparations\\nChinese thoroughwax is available as dried root and\\ncapsules in herb stores, health food stores, and Chinese\\nmarkets. It is also available in several formulated Chi-\\nnese medicines. To prepare a daily serving of tea, 3–12 g\\nof the dried root can be simmered for over an hour in a\\nquart of water. For more extreme cases of fever and he-\\npatitis, two servings of the tea can be drunk daily.\\nSide effects\\nChinese thoroughwax can cause nausea, dizziness,\\nsweating, and intestinal discomfort when taken in exces-\\nsively high dosages.\\nInteractions\\nChinese thoroughwax is frequently prescribed with\\nlicorice root and Korean ginseng. In the traditional and\\noften used Oriental medicine called shosaikoto in Japan-\\nese or xiao chai hu tang in Chinese, Chinese thorough-\\nwax is blended with licorice, jujube fruit, ginger root,\\nKorean ginseng, Chinese skullcap root, and half summer\\nroot (Pinellia ternata). Herbalists often recommend that\\nChinese thoroughwax be combined with lycii berries to\\ncounteract its drying effects in the body. For cases of\\nvertigo and chest pain, and as a liver tonic, bupleurum\\ncan be taken with white peony root , bitter orange fruit,\\nand licorice. For menstruation problems, bupleurum\\nmay be combined with white peony and mint.\\nBupleurum has been reported to have negative inter-\\nactions with interferon, which is a protein produced by\\nanimal cells when they are invaded by a virus. Interferon\\nis frequently used to treat hepatitis, and patients who are\\nreceiving interferon for this disease should not take\\nherbal formulations containing bupleurum.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nLu, Henry C.

Frey, PhD\\nChinese yam\\nDescription\\nChinese yam ( Dioscorea opposita ) is a root that is\\nused in traditional Chinese medicine . The Chinese\\npharmaceutical name for this herbal is Rhizoma\\ndioscoreae . Other names for Chinese yam include\\ndioscorea and shan yao. Chinese yam is native to China,\\nJapan, Korea, and Taiwan, where it can be found grow-\\ning wild on hill slopes and in valleys. It is also propagat-\\ned for medicinal and dietary uses.\\nThe genus name Dioscorea is dedicated to the\\nGreek physician and naturalist, Diosorides. There are be-\\ntween 600 and 800 different species of Dioscorea, mak-\\ning it one of the largest genera of the plant kingdom.\\nMany species in this genus are grown and collected for\\ntheir medicinal properties. Sweet potatoes are often\\ncalled yams, although they are different plants.\\nThe Chinese yam plant is a climbing vine that sup-\\nports itself by coiling around the branches of other vege-\\ntation. The plant can be 9.75 ft (3 m) high and 5 ft (1.5\\nm) wide. Chinese yam has heart-shaped leaves and it\\nproduces small white flowers which have a cinnamon-\\nlike aroma. Small tubers (called tubercles) form in the\\naxials (the angles between the leaves and the stem).\\nThese pea-sized tubercles are harvested in the late sum-\\nmer or early fall and are used to propagate the plant.\\nChinese yam plants take three or four years to reach\\nmaturity, although fairly large roots may be harvested from\\nwell developed plants after the first year. Chinese yam is a\\nspindle-shaped, thick, hard root or tuber that is white on\\nthe inside. However, cultivated forms from China or Japan\\nmay have different root shapes. The yam may be up to 1 yd\\n(about 1 m) in length. Chinese yam is dug up in the winter.\\nAfter the rough bark is removed, the root is washed and al-\\nlowed to dry in either the shade or the sun. The dried root\\nis rehydrated in water and then cut into slices.\\nChinese yam contains large amounts of mucilage.\\nMucilage is a thick, slimy substance produced by plants.\\nIt has a soothing effect on mucous membranes, such as\\nthe tissues that line the respiratory passages. This may\\nexplain why Chinese yam is effective at relieving cough.\\nGeneral use\\nTraditional Chinese medicine classifies Chinese yam\\nas neutral and sweet. It serves to tonify and augment the\\nspleen and stomach; augment the lung yin and tonify the\\nlung qi; and stabilize, tonify, and bind the kidneys. Chi-\\nnese yam enters through the spleen, lung, and kidney\\nchannels (meridians). It is used as a tonic (restores tone to\\ntissues). Chinese yam is used to treat weak digestion with\\nfatigueand diarrhea, general weakness, frequent urina-\\ntion, decreased appetite, leukorrhagia (excessive vaginal\\ndischarge), premature ejaculation, the symptoms associ-\\nated with diabetes, and chronic wheezing (whistling\\nsound caused by breathing difficulty) and coughing.\\nChinese yam should not be taken if the patient’s\\nsymptoms include abdominal swelling and pain.\\nPreparations\\nChinese yam may be found in the dried or fresh\\nform or as a powder. It is available in Asian food stores,\\nChinese pharmacies, and may be found in certain health\\nfood stores.\\nChinese yam is taken by mouth for all indications. A\\ntea (infusion) may be prepared by steeping slices of the\\nroot in boiling-hot water. The dosage is 10–30 g of root\\nor 6–10 g of powder.\\nCombinations\\nIt is common in traditional Chinese medicine to mix\\nherbs to treat specific sets of symptoms.

The Gale Group.)\\nOrigins\\nSpinal manipulation has a long history in many cul-\\ntures but Daniel D. Palmer is the founder of modern chi-\\nropractic theory, dating back to the 1890s. A grocer and\\nmagnetic healer, he applied his knowledge of the ner-\\nvous system and manual therapies in an unusual situa-\\ntion. One renowned story concerns Harvey Lillard, a jan-\\nitor in the office where Palmer worked. The man had\\nbeen deaf for 17 years, ever since he had sustained an in-\\njury to his upper spine. Palmer performed an adjustment\\non a painful vertebra in the region of the injury and Lil-\\nlard’s hearing was reputedly restored. Palmer theorized\\nthat all communication from the brain to the rest of the\\nbody passes through the spinal canal, and areas that are\\npoorly aligned or under stress can cause physical symp-\\ntoms both in the spine and in other areas of the body.\\nThus the body has the innate intelligence to heal itself\\nwhen unencumbered by spinal irregularities causing\\nnerve interference. After his success with Lillard, other\\npatients began coming to him for care, and responded\\nwell to adjustments. This resulted in Palmer’s further\\nstudy of the relationship between an optimally functional\\nspine and normal health.\\nPalmer founded the first chiropractic college in\\n1897. His son, B. J. Palmer, continued to develop chiro-\\npractic philosophy and practice after his father’s death.\\nB. J. and other faculty members were divided over the\\nrole of subluxation in disease. B. J. saw it as the cause of\\nall disease. The others disagreed and sought a more ra-\\ntional way of thinking, thus broadening the base of chi-\\nropractic education. From 1910-1920, many other chiro-\\npractic colleges were established. Other innovators, in-\\ncluding John Howard, Carl Cleveland, Earl Homewood,\\nJoseph Janse, Herbert Lee, and Claude Watkins also\\nhelped to advance the profession.\\nThe theories of the Palmers receive somewhat\\nbroader interpretation today. Many chiropractors believe\\nthat back pain can be relieved and health restored\\nthrough chiropractic treatment even in patients who do\\nnot have demonstrable subluxations. Scientific develop-\\nment and research of chiropractic is gaining momentum.\\nThe twenty-first century will likely see the metaphysical\\nconcepts such as innate intelligence give way to more\\nscientific proofs and reform.\\nMany people besides the Palmers have contributed\\nto the development of chiropractic theory and technique.\\nSome have gone on to create a variety of procedures and\\nrelated types of therapy that have their roots in chiro-\\npractic, including McTimoney-Corley chiropractic, cran-\\niosacral manipulation, naprapathy, and applied kinesiol-\\nogy. Osteopathy is another related holistic discipline\\nthat utilizes spinal and musculoskeletal manipulation as\\nly articulated, resulting in a condition known as subluxa-\\ntion, the theory is that nerve transmission is disrupted\\nand causes pain and illness manifested in the back as\\nwell as other areas of the body.\\nChiropractic is one of the most popular alternative\\ntherapies currently available. Some would say it now quali-\\nfies as mainstream treatment as opposed to complementary\\nmedicine. Chiropractic treatment is covered by many in-\\nsurance plans. It has become well-accepted treatment for\\nacute pain and problems of the spine, including lower back\\npain and whiplash. Applications beyond that scope are not\\nsupported by current evidence, although there are ongoing\\nstudies into the usefulness of chiropractic for such prob-\\nlems as ear infections, dysmenorrhea, infant colic,m i -\\ngraine headaches, and other conditions. Patients continue\\nto visit chiropractors with complaints of headaches and\\npain or injury to the neck, middle back, arms, or legs.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 458'),\n",

The patient should be asked\\nabout the current complaint, whether there are chronic\\nhealth problems, family history of disease, dietary habits,\\nmedical care received, and any medications currently\\nbeing taken.

A classic adjustment involves\\na high velocity, low amplitude thrust that produces a usu-\\nally painless popping noise, and improves the range of\\nmotion of the joint that was treated. The patient may lie\\non a specially designed, padded table that helps the prac-\\ntitioner to achieve the proper positions for treatment.\\nSome adjustments involve manipulating the entire spine,\\nor large portions of it, as a unit; others are small move-\\nments designed to affect a single joint. Stretching, trac-\\ntion, and slow manipulation are other techniques that can\\nbe employed to restore structural integrity and relieve\\nnerve interference.\\nLength of treatment\\nThe number of chiropractic treatments required will\\nvary depending on several factors. Generally longer-term\\ntreatment is needed for conditions that are chronic, se-\\nvere, or occur in conjunction with another health prob-\\nlem. Patients who are not in overall good health may also\\nhave longer healing times. Some injuries will inherently\\nrequire more treatments than others in order to get relief.\\nCare is given in three stages.

If\\nan injury occurred as a result of poor fitness or health, a\\nprogram of exercise or nutrition should be prescribed.\\nHome therapy may also be recommended, involving\\nsuch things as anti-inflammatory medication and appli-\\ncations of heat or ice packs. Conscious attention to pos-\\nture may help some patients avoid sustaining a similar\\ninjury in the future, and the chiropractor should be able\\nto discern what poor postural habits require correction. A\\nsedentary lifestyle, particularly with a lot of time spent\\nsitting, is likely to contribute to poor posture and may\\npredispose a person to back pain and injury.\\nTypes of practitioners\\nSome practitioners use spinal manipulation to the ex-\\nclusion of all other modalities, and are known as straight\\nchiropractors. Others integrate various types of therapy\\nsuch as massage, nutritional intervention, or treatment\\nwith vitamins, herbs, or homeopathic remedies. They also\\nembrace ideas from other health care traditions. This\\ngroup is known as mixers. The vast majority of chiroprac-\\ntors, perhaps 85%, fall in this latter category.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2460\\nChiropracticChiropractic inventor, Daniel David Palmer, was\\nborn on March 7, 1845, in Toronto, Ontario. He was\\none of five siblings, the children of a shoemaker and his\\nwife, Thomas and Katherine Palmer. Daniel Palmer and\\nhis older brother fell victim to wanderlust and left Cana-\\nda with a tiny cash reserve in April 1865. They immi-\\ngrated to the United States on foot, walking for 30 days\\nbefore arriving in Buffalo, New York. They traveled by\\nboat through the St. Lawrence Seaway to Detroit,\\nMichigan. There they survived by working odd jobs and\\nsleeping on the dock. Daniel Palmer settled in What\\nCheer, Iowa, where he supported himself and his first\\nwife as a grocer and fish peddler in the early 1880s. He\\nlater moved to Davenport, Iowa, where he raised three\\ndaughters and one son.\\nPalmer was a man of high curiosity. He investigated\\na variety of disciplines of medical science during his\\nlifetime, many of which were in their infancy. He was\\nintrigued by phrenology and assorted spiritual cults, and\\nfor nine years he investigated the relationship between\\nmagnetism and disease. Palmer felt that there was one\\nthing that caused disease. He was intent upon discover-\\ning this one thing, or as he called it: the great secret.\\nIn September 1895, Palmer purported to have cured\\na deaf man by placing pressure on the man’s displaced\\nvertebra. Shortly afterward Palmer claimed to cure an-\\nother patient of heart trouble, again by adjusting a dis-\\nplaced vertebra. The double coincidence led Palmer to\\ntheorize that human disease might be the result of dislo-\\ncated or luxated bones, as Palmer called them. That\\nsame year he established the Palmer School of Chiro-\\npractic where he taught a three-month course in the\\nsimple fundamentals of medicine and spinal adjustment.\\nPalmer, who was married six times during his life,\\ndied in California in 1913; he was destitute.

This will help to achieve maximum results.\\nPrecautions\\nChiropractic is not an appropriate therapy for dis-\\neases that are severely degenerative and may require\\nmedication or surgery. Many conditions of the spine are\\namenable to manipulative treatment, but that does not in-\\nclude fractures. The practitioner should be informed in\\nadvance if the patient is on anticoagulants, or has osteo-\\nporosis or any other condition that may weaken the\\nbones. There are other circumstances that would con-\\ntraindicate chiropractic care, and these should be detect-\\ned in the history or physical exam. In addition to frac-\\ntures, Down syndrome, some congenital defects, and\\nsome types of cancer are a few of the things that may\\npreclude spinal manipulation. On rare occasions, a frac-\\nture or dislocation may occur. There is also a very slim\\npossibility of experiencing a stroke as a result of spinal\\nmanipulation, but estimates are that it is no more fre-\\nquent than 2.5 occurrences per one million treatments.\\nBe wary of chiropractors who insist on costly x rays\\nand repeated visits with no end in sight. Extensive use is\\nnot scientifically justifiable, especially in most cases of\\nlower back pain. There are some circumstances when x\\nrays are indicated, including acute or possibly severe in-\\njuries such as those that might result from a car accident.\\nSide effects\\nIt is not uncommon to have local discomfort in the\\nform of aches, pains, or spasms for a few days following\\na chiropractic treatment. Some patients may also experi-\\nence mild headache or fatigue that resolves quickly.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nAs recently as the 1970s, the American Medical As-\\nsociation (a national group of medical doctors) was quite\\nhostile to chiropractic. AMA members were advised that\\nit was unethical to be associated with chiropractors. For-\\ntunately that has changed, and as of the year 2000, many\\nallopathic or traditionally trained physicians enjoyed\\ncordial referral relationships with chiropractors. The\\npublic is certainly strongly in favor of chiropractic treat-\\nment. An estimated 15% of people in the United States\\nused chiropractic care in 1997. Chiropractors see the\\nlion’s share of all patients who seek medical help for\\nback problems.\\nResearch has also supported the use of spinal ma-\\nnipulation for acute low-back pain. There is some anec-\\ndotal evidence recommending chiropractic treatment for\\nailments unrelated to musculoskeletal problems, but\\nthere is not enough research-based data to support this.\\nOn the other hand, a chiropractor may be able to treat\\nproblems and diseases unrelated to the skeletal structure\\nby employing therapies other than spinal manipulation.\\nAlthough many chiropractors limit their practice to\\nspine and joint problems, others claim to treat disorders\\nthat are not closely related to the back or musculoskeletal\\nsystem. These include asthma, bed-wetting, bronchitis,\\ncoughs, dizziness , dysmenorrhea, earache, fainting,\\nheadache, hyperactivity, indigestion , infertility ,m i -\\ngraine, pneumonia , and issues related to pregnancy.\\nThere are at least three explanations for possible efficacy\\nfor these conditions. One is that the problem could be\\nlinked to a nerve impingement, as may be possible with\\nbed-wetting, dizziness, fainting, and headache. In a sec-\\nond group, chiropractic treatment may offer some relief\\nfrom complicating pain and spasms caused by the disease\\nprocess, as with asthma, bronchitis, coughs, and pneumo-\\nnia. The discomforts of pregnancy may also be relieved\\nwith gentle chiropractic therapy. A third possibility is that\\nmanipulation or use of soft-tissue techniques may direct-\\nly promote improvement of some conditions. One partic-\\nular procedure, known as the endonasal technique, is\\nthought to help the eustachian tube to open and thus im-\\nprove drainage of the middle ear. The tube is sometimes\\nblocked off due to exudates or inflammatory processes.\\nThis can offer significant relief from earaches. Some\\nheadaches also fall in this category, as skilled use of soft\\ntissue techniques and adjustment may relieve the muscle\\ntension that may initiate some headaches.\\nDysmenorrhea, hyperactivity, indigestion, and infer-\\ntility are said to be relieved as a result of improved flow\\nof blood and nerve energy following treatment. Evidence\\nfor this is anecdotal at best, but manipulation is unlikely\\nto be harmful if causes treatable by other modalities have\\nbeen ruled out.\\nFor conditions such as cancer, fractures, infectious\\ndiseases, neurologic disease processes, and anything that\\nmay cause increase orthopedic fragility, chiropractic\\ntreatment alone is not an effective therapy, and may even\\nbe harmful in some cases.

The\\ndisease is caused by a bacterium called Chlamydia tra-\\nchomatis. The following areas in the body can be affected:\\n• cervix\\n• fallopian tubes, which carry ova (eggs) from the ovaries\\nto the uterus\\n• urethra, which carries urine from the bladder to outside\\nthe body\\n• epididymis, a small organ attached to the testicles that\\nis responsible for sperm production\\n• prostate gland, a gland at the base of the penis which\\nprovides nutrients for sperm\\n• anus\\n• throat\\n• eyes\\nIn addition, Chlamydia trachomatis also causes lung\\nand eye infections in newborns whose mothers have a\\nchlamydial infection during the last part of their preg-\\nnancy.\\nDescription\\nChlamydia is most often found in sexually active\\nadolescents aged 15–19. Data gathered by the Centers\\nfor Disease Control (CDC) suggest that sexually active\\ngirls in this age group may account for up to 46% of\\nchlamydial infections.\\nAccording to the CDC, approximately 40% of\\nwomen infected with chlamydia will develop pelvic in-\\nflammatory disease (PID). If untreated, 18% of women\\nwith PID will have chronic inflammatory pain. In addi-\\ntion, chlamydia may cause extensive damage to the fal-\\nlopian tubes.

Young sexually active people aged 15–19 are\\nmost frequently affected.\\n• Race. Blacks contract this disease more often than\\nwhites or Hispanics.\\n• Marital status. Chlamydia is most often found in single\\nwomen. Married women have the lowest risk.\\n• Behavioral factors. Douching increases risk of chlamy-\\ndial infections. Smoking also increases one’s risk of\\ncontracting this disease. Those who have sex with\\nmany different partners or with strangers are at high\\nrisk. Also at increased risk are those who have unpro-\\ntected sex with partners of unknown disease status. Pre-\\nvious induced abortions also increase a woman’s\\nchance of getting this disease.\\n• Socio-economic status. Poor, uneducated women living\\nin big cities are more often affected by this disease.\\n• Postpartum period. Increased risk of contracting\\nchlamydia is observed during the period immediately\\nafter giving birth or undergoing an induced abortion.\\nThis is because the cervix is not entirely closed, allow-\\ning more chance for becoming infected.\\nSymptoms\\nApproximately 75% of women do not have symp-\\ntoms.

They often require swipes from the site of infec-\\ntion or urine samples. Tests for chlamydia include:\\n• Cell culture test. This old test is reliable but requires\\n48–72 hours to complete. It is being replaced by faster\\nand more convenient tests. In 2001, the U.S. Food and\\nDrug Administration (FDA) receommended routine\\nscreening for chlamydia among sexually active young\\nwomen. One year later, they approved a new test called\\nThinPrep, a new type of Pap smear that allows doctors to\\nscreen for chlamydia,gonorrhea, and the human papil-\\nlomavirus at the same time women have annual pap\\nexams for cervical cancer.\\n• Direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) staining.

However, if not detected early enough, scar-\\nring of fallopian tubes (and resulting infertility) may not\\nbe preventable. The two most commonly used drugs are\\nazithromycin and doxycycline. Azithromycin is a more\\nexpensive drug but is much more convenient to adminis-\\nter. Only one dose is needed to treat the disease. Doxycy-\\ncline is cheaper but needs to be taken twice a day for\\nmore than seven days. Because patients tend to stop tak-\\ning drugs after a few days, doxycycline is not as effective\\nas azithromycin. Therefore, many doctors prefer to give\\nazithromycin. Patients are advised to refrain from sex for\\na full week after taking azithromycin or until they finish\\ndoxycycline treatment.\\nAn infected person should contact all partners with-\\nin the last two months so that they can be treated for\\nchlamydia.\\nInfected pregnant women should be given ery-\\nthromycin for seven days, instead of other drugs, be-\\ncause this drug is safer during pregnancy.\\nFollow-up testing is done four weeks after drug\\ntreatment to see if the infection is eradicated. If tests\\ncontinues to be positive, the patient will be given another\\ncourse of antibiotics.\\nExpected results\\nA woman‘s prognosis depends on the duration of in-\\nfection, whether the infection has spread through the\\nuterus and the fallopian tubes, and the number of previ-\\nous chlamydial infections. If caught early, the disease can\\nbe completely cured with antibiotic treatment in seven\\ndays.

The following practices are\\nrecommended to prevent the spread of this and other sex-\\nually transmitted diseases:\\n• Abstinence. Abstinence is the only 100% way to pre-\\nvent chlamydia and other STD infections.\\n• Monogamy. Having a mutually monogamous relation-\\nship with an uninfected partner reduces the chance of\\ngetting STD infections.\\n• Avoiding a sexual relationship with an unknown part-\\nner or a partner whose infection status is unknown.\\n• If having sex with an unknown partner, using a barrier\\ncontraceptive such as a condom (for men) or di-\\naphragm (for women) is recommended.

Several scientists believe\\nchlorella stimulates the activity of T-cells—important for\\nantibody immunity—and macrophages, which are large\\ncells that protect against infection by removing waste prod-\\nucts, harmful microorganisms, and other toxins from the\\nbloodstream. Increasing the production of T-cells and\\nmacrophages increases interferon levels in the body, en-\\nhancing the immune system’s ability to fight invading sub-\\nstances such as viruses, bacteria, and chemicals. Interferon\\nis an immune related protein produced by the body, which\\nperforms antiviral and antitumor activities.\\nStudies in laboratory animals suggest some sub-\\nstances in chlorella may reduce bone marrow suppres-\\nsion in patients taking the anticancer drug fluorouracil.\\nIn doing this, chlorella may increase the white blood cell\\nand platelet counts, which reduces the risk of infection\\nand bleeding, respectively.\\nStudies have also shown chlorella can significantly\\nreduce cholesterol levels in laboratory animals. Studies\\nare currently underway to see if it has the same effect on\\nhuman cholesterol levels.\\nChlorella may also help reduce blood pressure in\\nsome people with hypertension (high blood pressure). A\\nstudy reported in the March 2003 issue of Original In-\\nternist showed that treatment with 10 grams of chlorella\\ndaily for three months significantly improved blood\\npressure in 25% of the patients.\\nIn a 2000 study, patients with fibromyalgia syn-\\ndrome (a disorder that causes muscle aches, fatigue, and\\nsleep disorders) were treated with high doses of chlorel-\\nla. After two months, the study found significant benefits\\nfrom chlorella treatment.\\nClinical studies of laboratory animals have also\\nshown that chlorella can protect against gamma radiation\\nand other toxic drugs and chemicals, including dioxin. In\\nthe intestines, it can deactivate heavy metals such as cad-\\nmium, lead, and mercury.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2466\\nChlorella\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAbstinence—The act of doing without something,\\nsuch as sex, voluntarily.\\nInfertility—Inability to have children, which may\\noccur as a result of pelvic infections.\\nNongonococcal urethritis (NGU) —A sexually\\ntransmitted urethral infection that is not gonor-\\nrhea.\\nPelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) —An infection\\nof the uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or ovaries in\\nwomen.\\nTubal pregnancy —A pregnancy that implants in\\nthe fallopian tube instead of inside the uterus.

It\\nis manufactured in the liver and carried throughout the\\nbody in the bloodstream. Problems can occur when too\\nmuch cholesterol forms an accumulation of plaque on\\nblood vessel walls, which impedes blood flow to the\\nheart and other organs. The highest cholesterol content is\\nfound in meat, poultry, shellfish, and dairy products.\\nDescription\\nCholesterol is the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde of medi-\\ncine, since it has both a good side and bad side. It is nec-\\nessary to digest fats from food, make hormones, build\\ncell walls, and participate in other processes for maintain-\\ning a healthy body. When people talk about cholesterol as\\na medical problem, they are usually referring to high cho-\\nlesterol. This can be somewhat misleading, since there\\nare four components to cholesterol. These are:\\n• LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol\\n• HDL, the so-called good cholesterol\\n• triglycerides, a blood fat lipid that increases the risk for\\nheart disease\\n• total cholesterol\\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) esti-\\nmates that 90 million American adults, roughly one-half\\nof the adult population, have elevated cholesterol levels.\\nHigh LDL (low-density lipoprotein) is a major contribut-\\ning factor of heart disease. The cholesterol forms plaque\\nin the heart’s blood vessels, which restricts or blocks the\\nsupply of blood to the heart, and causes a condition\\ncalled atherosclerosis. This can lead to a heart attack ,\\nresulting in damage to the heart and possibly death.\\nIn 2001, chemical researchers found a link between\\ncholesterol and Alzheimer’s disease . Reducing the\\namount of cholesterol in the cells appears to block at-\\ntachment of senile plaques to the brain’s neurons.

More study remains to test the effects of choles-\\nterol on Alzheimer’s.\\nThe population as a whole is at some risk of develop-\\ning high LDL cholesterol in their lifetimes. Specific risk\\nfactors include a family history of high cholesterol,obe-\\nsity, heart attack or stroke, alcoholism, and lack of regu-\\nlar exercise. The chances of developing high cholesterol\\nincrease after the age of 45. One of the primary causes of\\nhigh LDL cholesterol is too much fat or sugar in the diet,\\na problem especially true in the United States. Choles-\\nterol also is produced naturally in the liver and overpro-\\nduction may occur even in people who limit their intake\\nof high cholesterol food. Low HDL and high triglyceride\\nlevels also are risk factors for atherosclerosis.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThere are no readily apparent symptoms that indi-\\ncate high LDL or triglycerides, or low HDL. The only\\nway to diagnose a problem is through a simple blood\\ntest. However, one general indication of high cholesterol\\nis obesity. Another is a high-fat diet. In 2001, new re-\\nsearch involving twins demonstrated that both genetic\\nfactors and diet contribute to cholesterol levels.\\nDiagnosis\\nHigh cholesterol often is diagnosed and treated by\\ngeneral practitioners or family practice physicians. In\\nsome cases, the condition is treated by an endocrinolo-\\ngist or cardiologist. Total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and\\ntriglyceride levels as well as the cholesterol to HDL ratio\\nare measured by a blood test called a lipid panel. The\\ncost of a lipid panel is generally $40-100 and is covered\\nby most health insurance and HMO plans, including\\nMedicare, providing there is an appropriate reason for\\nthe test. Home cholesterol testing kits are available over\\nthe counter but test only for total cholesterol. The results\\nshould only be used as a guide and if the total cholesterol\\nlevel is high or low, a lipid panel should be performed by\\na physician. In most adults the recommended levels,\\nmeasured by milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) of blood,\\nare: total cholesterol, less than 200; LDL, less than 130;\\nHDL, more than 35; triglycerides, 30-200; and choles-\\nterol to HDL ratio, four to one. However, the recom-\\nmended cholesterol levels may vary, depending on other\\nrisk factors such as hypertension , a family history of\\nheart disease, diabetes, age, alcoholism, and smoking.\\nDoctors have always been puzzled by why some\\npeople develop heart disease while others with identical\\nHDL and LDL levels do not. New studies indicate it may\\nbe due to the size of the cholesterol particles in the\\nbloodstream. A test called a nuclear magnetic resonance\\n(NMR) LipoProfile exposes a blood sample to a magnet-\\nic field to determine the size of the cholesterol particles.\\nParticle size also can be determined by a centrifugation\\ntest, where blood samples are spun very quickly to allow\\nparticles to separate and move at different distances. The\\nsmaller the particles, the greater the chance of develop-\\ning heart disease. It allows physicians to treat patients\\nwho have normal or close to normal results from a lipid\\npanel but abnormal particle size.\\nTreatment\\nThe primary goal of cholesterol treatment is to\\nlower LDL to under 160 mg/dL in people without heart\\ndisease and who are at lower risk of developing it. The\\ngoal in people with higher risk factors for heart disease is\\nless than 130 mg/dL. In patients who already have heart\\ndisease, the goal is under 100 mg/dL, according to FDA\\nguidelines.

The food is flavored with traditional\\nAsian spices and condiments, such as ginger, chilies,\\nturmeric, and soy sauce.\\nAnother regimen is the low glycemic or diabetic\\ndiet, which can raise the HDL (good cholesterol) level\\nby as much as 20% in three weeks. Low glycemic foods\\npromote a slow but steady rise in blood sugar levels fol-\\nlowing a meal, which increases the level of HDL. They\\nalso lower total cholesterol and triglycerides. Low\\nglycemic foods include certain fruits, vegetables, beans,\\nand whole grains. Processed and refined foods and sug-\\nars should be avoided.\\nExercise is an extremely important part of lowering\\nbad cholesterol and raising good cholesterol. It should\\nconsist of 20-30 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise at\\nleast three times a week. Exercises that cause the heart to\\nbeat faster include fast walking, bicycling, jogging,\\nroller skating, swimming, and walking up stairs. There\\nalso are a wide selection of aerobic programs available at\\ngyms or on videocassette.\\nGarlic\\nA number of clinical studies have indicated that gar-\\nlic can offer modest reductions in cholesterol. A 1997\\nstudy by nutrition researchers at Pennsylvania State\\nUniversity found men who took garlic capsules for five\\nmonths reduced their total cholesterol by 7% and LDL\\nby 12%. Another study showed that seven cloves of fresh\\ngarlic a day significantly reduced LDL, as did a daily\\ndose of four garlic extract pills. Other studies in 1997\\nand 1998 back up these results. However, two more re-\\ncent studies have questioned the effectiveness of garlic in\\nlowering “bad cholesterol.”\\nCholestin\\nCholestin hit the over-the-counter market in 1997 as\\na cholesterol-lowering dietary supplement. It is a\\nprocessed form of red yeast fermented with rice, a tradi-\\ntional herbal remedy used for centuries by the Chinese.\\nTwo studies released in 1998 showed Cholestin lowered\\nLDL cholesterol by 20-30%%. It also appeared to raise\\nHDL and lower triglyceride levels. Although the supple-\\nment contains hundreds of compounds, the major active\\nLDL-lowering ingredient is lovastatin, a chemical also\\nfound in the prescription drug Mevacor. The FDA\\nbanned Cholestin in early 1998 but a federal district\\ncourt judge lifted the ban a year later, ruling the product\\nwas a dietary supplement, not a drug. It is not fully un-\\nderstood how the substance works and patients may want\\nto consult with their physician before taking Cholestin.\\nNo serious side effects have been reported, but minor\\nside effects, including bloating and heartburn , have\\nbeen reported.\\nOther treatments\\nA study released in 1999 indicated that blue-green\\nalgae contains polyunsaturated fatty acids that lower cho-\\nlesterol. The algae, known as alga Aphanizomenon flos-\\naquae (AFA) is available as an over-the-counter dietary\\nsupplement. Niacin, also known as nicotinic acid or vita-\\nmin B3, has been shown to reduce LDL levels by 10-20%,\\nand raise HDL levels by 15-35%. It also can reduce\\ntriglycerides. But because an extremely high dose of\\nniacin (2-3 grams) is needed to treat cholesterol problems,\\nit should only be taken under a doctor’s supervision to\\nmonitor possible toxic side effects. Niacin also can cause\\nflushing when taken in high doses. Soy protein with high\\nlevels of isoflavones also have been shown to reduce bad\\ncholesterol by up to 10%. A daily diet that contains 62 mg\\nof isoflavones in soy protein is recommended, and can be\\nincorporated into other diet regimens, including vegetari-\\nan, Asian, and low glycemic. In 2003, research revealed\\nthat policosanol, a substance made from sugar cane wax\\nor beeswax, lowered LDL cholesterol nearly 27% in study\\nsubjects in a Cuban study.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nA wide variety of prescription medicines are avail-\\nable to treat cholesterol problems. These include statins\\nsuch as Mevacor (lovastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin), Prava-\\nchol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Baycol (cervas-\\ntatin), and Lipitor (atorvastatin) to lower LDL. A group of\\ndrugs called fibric acid derivatives are used to lower\\ntriglycerides and raise HDL. These include Lopid (gemfi-\\nbrozil), Atromid-S (clofibrate), and Tricor (fenofibrate).\\nA new class of drugs was identified late in 2001 that\\nwork differently from the statin drugs. These drugs rely\\non compounds that bind to a sterol that regulates protein\\n(called SCAP) and speds up removal of cholesterol from\\nthe plasma (the fluid part of the blood.) Doctors decide\\nwhich drug to use based on the severity of the choles-\\nterol problem, side effects, and cost.\\nExpected results\\nHigh cholesterol is one of the key risk factors for\\nheart disease.

One theory is that they slow down or stop the for-\\nmation of blood vessels that supply the cancer with oxy-\\ngen and nutrients. Another theory is that chondroitin\\nblocks the formation of certain enzymes that tumors pro-\\nduce to invade surrounding tissue. The third theory sug-\\ngests that cartilage products stimulate the immune system.\\nAs of late 1999 the National Cancer Institute was conduct-\\ning a multicenter clinical trial of liquid cartilage extract.\\nOsteoarthritis\\nChondroitin is best known to the general public as a\\nremedy for osteoarthritis, which is a form of arthritis\\ncaused by wearing away or degeneration of the cartilage\\nthat cushions the ends of bones. In particular, it is\\nthought that the drying of cartilage tissue in osteoarthri-\\ntis is a major cause of tissue destruction. Chondroitin\\nsulfate is given together with glucosamine, a building\\nblock of GAGs. The chondroitin helps to attract and hold\\nfluid within cartilage tissue. Tissue fluid keeps cartilage\\nhealthy in two ways: it acts as a shock absorber within\\nthe joints of the body, thus protecting cartilage from\\nbeing worn away by the bones; and it carries nutrients to\\nthe cartilage. The cartilage in the joints of the human\\nbody has no blood vessels, so it must receive its nutrients\\nfrom tissue fluid.\\nIn addition to drawing tissue fluid into cartilage,\\nchondroitin is also thought to protect cartilage by:\\n• Anti-inflammatory activity.\\n• Inhibiting the activity of enzymes that break down car-\\ntilage.\\n• Counteracting enzymes that interfere with the transport\\nof nutrients to the cartilage.\\n• Stimulating the production of proteoglycans, gly-\\ncosaminoglycans, and collagen. These complex mole-\\ncules are the building blocks of new cartilage.\\nSeveral randomized double-blind studies of chon-\\ndroitin in osteoarthritis patients were conducted in France\\nand Italy in 1998. The European studies demonstrated that\\noral as well as injected chondroitin helps to increase joint\\nmobility and reduce pain. A landmark 2001 study showed\\nthat combining glucosamine and chondroitin worked bet-\\nter than either alone in preventing cartilage damage and\\nthat both supplements worked well when taken orally.\\nPreparations\\nThe normal (non-vegetarian) adult diet already con-\\ntains a certain amount of chondroitin; it is found in most\\nanimal tissues, particularly the gristle attached to bones.\\nChondroitin sulfate can be taken orally as a pill,\\npowder, or liquid. It can also be administered by injec-\\ntion. Oral preparations of chondroitin, alone or in combi-\\nnation with glucosamine, are available in the United\\nStates as over-the-counter (OTC) dietary supplements.\\nThey can be purchased over the internet, at pharmacies,\\nhealth food stores, or even some grocery stores. Because\\nthey are marketed as dietary supplements, they do not re-\\nquire testing or approval by the Food and Drug Adminis-\\ntration (FDA). At present, there are no specific quality\\ncontrol requirements or good manufacturing process\\n(GMP) standards for these products.\\nThere are at present no standard patterns of adminis-\\ntration for chondroitin as a treatment for psoriasis or can-\\ncer. When chondroitin is used together with glucosamine\\nas a treatment for osteoarthritis, the daily dosage is based\\non the patient’s weight. Suggested dosages are: 1000 mg\\nglucosamine + 800 mg chondroitin sulfate for 120 lbs or\\nless; 1500 mg glucosamine + 1200 mg chondroitin sul-\\nfate for 120-200 lbs; and 2000 mg glucosamine + 1600\\nmg chondroitin sulfate for greater than 200 lbs.\\nFor maximum effectiveness, patients are advised to\\ndivide their daily dosage into 2 to 4 doses and take them\\nthroughout the day with food. They are also encouraged\\nto take vitamin C and manganese supplements since\\nthese substances appear to increase the effectiveness of\\nthe chondroitin.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are two important precautions to take regarding\\nchondroitin as a dietary supplement for osteoarthritis.

Thus,\\nChristian scientists believe that ill health can be cured by\\nspiritual education, understanding of the truth, and prayer.\\nOrigins\\nMary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science,\\nwas born Mary Baker in Bow, New Hampshire, on July\\n16, 1821, into a family of strict Christian practice and\\nPuritan values. Baker was ill for much of her childhood\\nand early adult life. She explored medical therapies pop-\\nular in her time, including homeopathy , and found no\\nrelief for her chronic illness.\\nBetween 1862 and 1865 Baker was a patient of a\\ncharismatic healer named Phineas Parkhurst Quimby. A\\nformer hypnotist, Quimby developed a philosophy of\\nmental healing based on the belief that he had rediscov-\\nered the secret of Jesus’ ability to heal the sick. It is\\nthought that Quimby’s ideas may have influenced Baker\\nin the development of her philosophy of Christian Sci-\\nence healing, although she herself denied it.\\nIn 1866, the same year that Phineas Quimby died,\\nBaker suffered a spinal injury from a fall. This proved to\\nbe a critical turning point in her life. Seeking strength in\\nthe Bible to sustain her through the injury, Baker read a\\nNew Testament account of Jesus’ healing. While she was\\nreading, she experienced a sudden insight into how\\nJesus’ healing was accomplished, and as she read, she\\nfound herself suddenly released from her injury and re-\\nstored to health.\\nThis transformation inspired Baker to spend the next\\nthree years studying the scriptures and codifying her dis-\\ncoveries about healing. She called her discoveries Christ-\\nian Science, and believed that she had found the one and\\nonly “truth.” She put her principles into action by heal-\\ning others, including those who had illnesses declared by\\nmedical practitioners of the day to be incurable.\\nAs Baker studied the Bible and practiced healing,\\nshe came to believe that she could teach others to heal\\nfollowing God’s truth as she had discovered it. In 1870\\nin Lynn, Massachusetts, she taught her first class and\\nbegan to develop a following that shared her belief in\\nChristian Science healing.\\nIn 1875, while still living in Lynn, Mary Baker pub-\\nlished Science and Health later renamed Science and\\nHealth with Key to the Scriptures . This book, revised by\\nBaker Eddy over the next 35 years, is the fundamental\\ndocument explaining the doctrine of Christian Science\\nhealing.\\nIn 1877 Mary Baker married fellow Christian Scien-\\ntist Asa Gilbert Eddy and by 1879 had established\\nenough of a following to found the first Church of\\nChrist, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. This church\\nbecame her headquarters and is known as the Mother\\nChurch. The regulatory structure of the denomination\\nwas set forth in her book The Manual of the Mother\\nChurch published in 1895.\\nThroughout the late 1800s, Christian Science con-\\ntinued to attract converts. Most of these conversions\\nwere brought about by demonstrations of Christian Sci-\\nence healing. Eddy also established the Massachusetts\\nMetaphysical College to teach Christian Science healing.\\nIt is estimated that by 1895 there were about 250 Christ-\\nian Science congregations, mainly in New England.\\nMary Baker Eddy died on December 3, 1910. At the\\ntime of her death, there were about 1,200 Christian Scien-\\ntist congregations in the United States. By the 1930s the\\nnumber had increased to about 2,400. The United States\\nBureau of the Census in 1936 estimated church member-\\nship in the United States at about 269,000. Meanwhile\\ncongregations were also being established overseas.\\nAfter World War II, the number of Christian Science\\ncongregations began to decline. Beginning in the 1980s\\nthe church had to deal with negative publicity from court\\ncases alleging that the failure of Christian Science parents\\nto seek conventional medical treatment for children who\\nhad illnesses considered treatable by mainstream medicine\\nconstituted child endangerment. Convictions, many of\\nwhich were overturned on appeal, further hurt church\\nmembership. The number of Christian Scientist practition-\\ners, as those people whom the Church of Christ, Scientist\\nofficially recognizes as spiritual healers are called,\\ndropped from about 8,000 in 1960 to about 2,000 in 1998.\\nToday Mary Baker Eddy is recognized both as a\\nmind-body healer and as a pioneer in the area of equality\\nfor women. In the Church of Christ, Scientist, men and\\nwomen function equally as leaders and healers, an idea\\nthat was revolutionary in Eddy’s lifetime. In 1995 she\\nwas elected to the National Women’s Hall of Fame in\\nrecognition of being the only American woman to found\\nan internationally established religion.\\nIn addition to its practices of spiritual healing,\\nChristian Science is best known today for its publishing\\nactivities, spearheaded by the international newspaper\\nthe Christian Science Monitor founded by Eddy in 1908.\\nEach congregation also provides a public Christian Sci-\\nence Reading Room where the public may read Christian\\nScience literature and ponder spiritual matters.\\nBenefits\\nFor believers, Christian Science healing brings both\\nspiritual and physical well being to those who are ill.

It uses no material methods or laying\\non of hands to restore people to health and can be prac-\\nticed in almost any setting.\\nDescription\\nTo understand Christian Science healing one must also\\nunderstand Christian Science theology, because the two are\\ninextricably linked. On the first page of Science and Health\\nwith Key to the ScripturesEddy writes, “The prayer that re-\\nforms the sinner and heals the sick is an absolute faith that\\nall things are possible to God..and a spiritual understanding\\nof Him, an unselfed love.. Prayer, watching, and working,\\ncombined with self-immolation, are God’s gracious means\\nfor accomplishing whatever has been successfully done for\\nthe Christianization and health of mankind.”\\nChristian Science teaches that the ordinary physical\\nworld that we perceive is a misconception. Matter is not\\ncreated by God, but appears because of man’s limited\\nperception. Jesus, Eddy explains, was able to heal the\\nsick, the blind, and the lame, because he saw beyond their\\nmaterial form and saw the spirit essence of the person.\\nIn writing on the human body in Science and Health\\nwith Key to the Scriptures , Eddy states, “To measure in-\\ntellectual capacity by the size of the brain and strength\\nby the exercise of muscle, is to subjugate intelligence, to\\nmake the mind mortal, and to place this so-called mind\\nat the mercy of material organization and non-intelligent\\nmatter. Obedience to the so-called physical laws of\\nhealth has not checked sickness. Diseases have multi-\\nplied since man-made material theories took the place of\\nspiritual truth. You say that indigestion , fatigue, sleep-\\nlessness, cause distressed stomachs and aching heads.\\nThen you consult your brain in order to remember what\\nhas hurt you, when your remedy lies in forgetting the\\nwhole thing; for matter has no sensation of its own and\\nthe human mind is all that can produce pain.”\\nFor believers, Christian Science healing is the tri-\\numph of mind over matter and the spiritual over the ma-\\nterial world. Ill health is simply an illusion. Good health\\noccurs when the mind achieves awareness of itself,\\nwhich is synonymous with awareness of God. The goal\\nof healing is not to remove physical suffering, but to lead\\nthe ill person to Christ and transform the consciousness\\ninto a more pure and spiritual state that knows God.\\nHealing is seen as a measure of the depth of one’s sincer-\\nity and belief.\\nSince health does not reside in the body, and is not\\ncontrolled by physical laws, Christian Science healing\\ncannot occur when a person is in a state of moral sinful-\\nness or lack of belief. The basis of disease is fear, igno-\\nrance, or sin. Health is a spiritual fact to be demonstrated.\\nChristian Science teaches that all believers can be\\ntaught to heal. Those people officially sanctioned as heal-\\ners by the Church of Christ, Scientist are called Christian\\nScience practitioners. Practitioners may be either male or\\nfemale. These people must pledge to devote themselves\\nto the practice of healing full time. They may be paid by\\ntheir patients for their work. In 2000 there were about\\n2,000 officially recognized Christian Science practition-\\ners in the United States, and that number is declining.\\nPractitioners do not use any material props or even\\ntouch to heal their patients; only prayer is used. The prac-\\ntitioner approaches the patient with a clear conviction of\\nthe omnipotence of God and the firm belief that God is\\ngood and produces only good things. Practitioners who\\nhold false beliefs, or error, even unwitting error, blended\\nwith the truth, have weak healing abilities and may be\\nguilty of malpractice. If the healer realizes the truth, it\\nwill free his patient from symptoms of disease, discord,\\nand disharmony and lead the patient to Christ. This is said\\nto leave the patient feeling calm, refreshed, and healthy.\\nMany converts come to Christian Science through\\nthe demonstration of its power to heal. Traditionally,\\nWednesday night meetings are given over to healing testi-\\nmony and witnessing of the healing power of God’s truth.\\nPreparations\\nThe purpose of Christian Science healing is not to\\nfree the body from disease, but to lead the patient to a\\nhigher spiritual understanding of God. Patients are best\\nserved if they are receptive to Christian Science beliefs\\nand practices prior to the start of a healing session.\\nPrecautions\\nThere are no reasons other than disbelief or spiritual\\nunreadiness not to participate in Christian Science heal-\\ning. However, patients that do this must understand that\\nthey may be exacerbating their health problems by deny-\\ning themselves access to traditional medical care.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects are reported from practicing Christ-\\nian Science healing. There is, as noted above, danger\\nposed by replacing traditional medical care with Christ-\\nian Science practices in the case of serious illness.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nChristian Science healing is seen by the traditional\\nmedical community as quackery, since it denies any rela-\\ntionship between the physical universe and illness.

Insulin\\nhelps transport glucose from the bloodstream into liver,\\nmuscle, and fat cells. Once it is inside these cells, the\\nsugar is metabolized into a source of energy. Insulin is\\nalso involved in regulating protein, fat, and catalytic en-\\nzyme processes. People with diabetes do not produce in-\\nsulin (or produce very little) or their bodies cannot proper-\\nly use the insulin that is produced. As a result, sugar builds\\nup in the bloodstream, causing serious health effects. Nu-\\nmerous scientific studies have shown that chromium is\\nuseful in treating insulin resistance(metabolic syndrome)\\nand diabetes. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy,a  f o r m  o f\\nnerve damage that is a direct result of diabetes, is indirect-\\nly related to a lack of sufficient chromium.\\nSeveral studies have shown that chromium supple-\\nments may improve insulin sensitivity, and lower blood\\nglucose and elevated body fat. In February 2004, the\\nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Medicine began a\\ncomprehensive study of chromium as a therapy for in-\\nsulin resistance. This condition occurs when the body\\nfails to respond properly to the insulin it already pro-\\nduces. People who are insulin resistant may have the\\nability to overcome this problem by producing more in-\\nsulin. However, if the body cannot produce sufficient\\namounts of insulin, glucose levels in the bloodstream\\nrise, and type 2 diabetes ultimately occurs. It is estimated\\nthat up to 80 million Americans have insulin resistance.\\nA study conducted by Isala Clinics and University\\nHospital Groningen in the Netherlands, and released in\\n2003, showed that a daily dose of 1,000 micrograms of\\nchromium significantly reduced blood sugar levels in peo-\\nple with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes who use insulin.\\nChromium has also been used as an effective treat-\\nment for polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a hor-\\nmonal condition affecting about two million American\\nwomen. The condition can lead to infertility if untreat-\\ned, and is associated with insulin resistance and type 2\\ndiabetes. A study released in 2003 by the State Universi-\\nty of New York at Stony Brook showed that insulin sen-\\nsitivity increased an average of 35 percent after two\\nmonths of daily treatment with 1,000 micrograms (/H9262g)\\nof chromium.\\nThrough its involvement with insulin function,\\nchromium plays an indirect role in lowering blood lipids.\\nStudies suggest, but have not proven, that chromium sup-\\nplementation can reduce the risk of cardiovascular (heart)\\njects the concepts of germs, contagion, and healing\\nthrough the application of drugs.\\nAll “proof” of the effectiveness of Christian Science\\nhealing is anecdotal.

However, several studies contradict\\nthese claims. Studies in animals suggest chromium sup-\\nplementation may reduce hypertension (high blood pres-\\nsure). Lipid reduction is secondary to insulin regulation\\nand control; therefore, persons whose insulin is well reg-\\nulated and controlled may not achieve reduced heart dis-\\nease risk by taking chromium supplements.\\nChromium supplements in high doses—1,000 /H9262g or\\nmore a day—are sometimes used in weight loss and\\nmuscle development. However, a number of scientific\\nstudies have found that chromium supplements are not\\neffective in these areas. In fact, precautions warn against\\nchromium doses exceeding 1,000 /H9262g per day. Weight\\nloss and muscle development are secondary to insulin\\nregulation and control. Therefore, when insulin is well\\nregulated and controlled, chromium may not impact\\nweight loss or muscle development.\\nPreparations\\nA complete lack of chromium is rare, and the United\\nStates Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not es-\\ntablished recommended dietary allowances (RDA) for the\\nmineral. However, national statistics on the prevalence of\\ndiabetes, heart disease, and obesity suggest that chromi-\\num deficiencies may be common. Chromium occurs nat-\\nurally in meat, seafood, dairy products, eggs, whole\\ngrains, black pepper, and almonds. According to The\\nPDR Family Guide to Natural Medicines and Healing\\nTherapies, the usual chromium supplement dose for chil-\\ndren ages seven and older and adults is 50–200 /H9262g a day\\nin tablets or capsules. For persons with type 2 diabetes\\nwho are not taking insulin, doses from 200–1,000 /H9262g\\ndaily may be taken. However, persons should only take\\ndoses at these levels after consulting with a physician.\\nChromium should not be taken in doses exceeding 1,000\\n/H9262g a day. The cost of a bottle of 100 tablets or capsules\\n(200 /H9262g) of chromium picolinate ranges from $5 to $10.\\nPrecautions\\nDoses of 200–1,000 /H9262g of chromium should be\\ntaken only after consultation with a physician. Pregnant\\nor breastfeeding women are advised to consult a physi-\\ncian before taking chromium supplements. Chromium\\nshould not be taken in doses exceeding 1,000 /H9262g a day.\\nIncreased dietary sugar may be associated with higher\\nurinary excretion of chromium.\\nSide effects\\nSeveral studies have noted occasional reports of irreg-\\nular heartbeats with chromium use. Infrequently, chromi-\\num has been reported to cause such sleep pattern changes\\nas insomnia and increased dream activity. Irritability has\\nalso been reported. In rare instances, persons may be aller-\\ngic to a chromium formula. The symptoms of an allergic\\nreaction include difficulty breathing, chest pain, hives,\\nrash, and itchy or swollen skin. If this happens, the patient\\nis advised to seek medical care immediately. High doses\\nmay also cause liver and kidney damage, or gastric irrita-\\ntion, although these side effects are rare.\\nInteractions\\nPersons who are taking antacids are advised to talk\\nwith a physician before taking chromium supplements.\\nStudies in animals suggest that antacids, especially those\\ncontaining calcium carbonate, may reduce the body’s\\nability to absorb chromium. Studies have shown that\\nchromium may enhance the effectiveness of drugs taken\\nby people who have type 2 diabetes or insulin resistance.\\nThese drugs include glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide, in-\\nsulin, and metformin. Individuals taking these drugs\\nshould discuss chromium supplementation with a physi-\\ncian because improved insulin function may necessitate\\nmedication dosage changes.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBrown, Donald J.

Reports of a CFS-\\nlike syndrome called neurasthenia date back to 1869.\\nLater, people with similar symptoms were said to have\\nfibromyalgiabecause one of the main symptoms is\\nmyalgia, or muscle pain. Because of the similarity of\\nsymptoms, fibromyalgia and CFS are considered to be\\noverlapping syndromes.\\nIn the early to mid-1980s, there were outbreaks of\\nCFS in some areas of the United States. Although many\\nCFS patients had high levels of antibodies to the Ep-\\nstein-Barr virus (EBV), which causes mononucleosis ,\\nmany healthy people also had high levels of EBV anti-\\nbodies. Scientists have also found high levels of other\\nviral antibodies in the blood of CFS patients. These find-\\nings have led many scientists to believe that a virus or\\ncombination of viruses may trigger CFS.\\nAlthough CFS can affect people of any gender, age,\\nrace, or socioeconomic group, most patients diagnosed\\nwith CFS are 25–45 years old and female. Estimates of\\nhow many people are afflicted with CFS vary due to the\\nsimilarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the\\ndifficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Con-\\ntrol and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that 4–10 peo-\\nple per 100,000 in the United States have CFS. Accord-\\ning to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in\\nthe United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS.\\nThis probably is a low estimate since these figures do not\\ninclude children and are based on the CDC definition of\\nCFS, which is very strict for research purposes.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThere is no single known cause for CFS. Studies\\nhave pointed to several different conditions that might be\\nresponsible. These include:\\n• viral infections\\n• chemical toxins\\n• allergies\\n• immune abnormalities\\n• psychological disorders\\nMany doctors and researchers think that CFS may\\nnot be a single illness but a group of symptoms caused\\nby several conditions. One theory is that a microorgan-\\nism, such as a virus, or a chemical injures the body and\\ndamages the immune system, allowing dormant viruses\\nto become active. When these viruses start growing\\nagain, the immune system may overreact and produce\\nchemicals called cytokines that can cause flu-like symp-\\ntoms. Immune abnormalities have been found in studies\\nLydic, Michael L., et al. “Effects of Chromium Supplementa-\\ntion on Insulin Sensitivity and Reproductive Function in\\nPolycystic Ovarian Syndrome: A Pilot Study.”Fertility\\nand Sterility (Supplement 3) (September 2003): 45–46.\\nV olpe, Stella L., et al. “Effect of Chromium Supplementation\\nand Exercise on Body Composition, Resting Metabolic\\nRate, and Selected Biochemical Parameters in Moderately\\nObese Women Following an Exercise Program.”Journal of\\nthe American College of Nutrition(August 2001): 293–306.\\nWard, Elizabeth M. “Top 10 Supplements for Men.” Men’s\\nHealth (December 2003): 106.\\nKen R.

They\\nsaid infections may also play a role in the condition, but\\nhave still not identified one single agent common to all\\npatients with CFS and they have encouraged further re-\\nsearch. The panel also concluded that reproductive hor-\\nmones may play a role in the condition, which might ex-\\nplain a higher prevalence among women.\\nThe role of psychological problems in CFS is very\\ncontroversial. Because many people with CFS are diag-\\nnosed with depression and other psychiatric disorders,\\nsome experts conclude that the symptoms of CFS are\\npsychological. However, many people with CFS did not\\nhave psychological disorders before getting the illness.\\nMany doctors think that patients become depressed or\\nanxious because of the effects of the symptoms of their\\nCFS. One recent study concluded that depression was\\nthe result of CFS, not its cause.\\nPeople with CFS have severe fatigue that keeps\\nthem from performing their normal daily activities. They\\nmay have sleep disturbances that keep them from getting\\nenough rest or they may sleep too much. When they ex-\\nercise or try to be active in spite of their fatigue, people\\nwith CFS experience debilitating exhaustion that can\\nconfine them to bed for days.\\nOther symptoms of CFS include:\\n• muscle pain (myalgia)\\n• joint pain (arthralgia)\\n• sore throat\\n• headache\\n• fever and chills\\n• tender lymph nodes\\n• trouble concentrating\\n• memory loss\\nA recent study at Johns Hopkins University found an\\nabnormality in blood pressure regulation in 22 of 23 pa-\\ntients with CFS. This abnormality, called neurally mediated\\nhypotension, causes a sudden drop in blood pressure when\\na person has been standing, exercising, or exposed to heat\\nfor a while. When this occurs, patients feel lightheaded and\\nmay faint. They often are exhausted for hours to days after\\none of these episodes. When treated with salt and medica-\\ntions to stabilize blood pressure, many patients in the study\\nhad marked improvements in their CFS symptoms.\\nDiagnosis\\nCFS is diagnosed by evaluating symptoms and elim-\\ninating other causes of fatigue. Doctors carefully ques-\\ntion patients about their symptoms, any other illnesses\\nthey have had, and medications they are taking. They\\nalso conduct a physical examination, neurological exam-\\nination, and laboratory tests to identify any underlying\\ndisorders or other diseases that cause fatigue. In the\\nUnited States, many doctors use the CDC case definition\\nto determine if a patient has CFS.\\nTo be diagnosed with CFS, patients must meet both\\nof the following criteria:\\n• Unexplained continuing or recurring chronic fatigue\\nfor at least six months that is of new or definite onset,\\nis not the result of ongoing exertion, and is not mainly\\nrelieved by rest, and causes occupational, educational,\\nsocial, or personal activities to be greatly reduced.\\n• Four or more of the following symptoms: loss of short-\\nterm memory or ability to concentrate; sore throat; tender\\nlymph nodes; muscle pain; multi-joint pain without\\nswelling or redness; headaches of a new type, pattern, or\\nseverity; nonrefreshing sleep; and post-exertional malaise\\n(a vague feeling of discomfort or tiredness following ex-\\nercise or other physical or mental activity) lasting more\\nthan 24 hours.

Treatment of airborne allergies is an im-\\nportant facet in the treatment of CFS.\\nDiet\\nDrinking eight to 12 glasses of water daily helps\\nfight fatigue. Food allergies can worsen CFS symptoms.\\nCommon food allergies include milk, wheat, eggs, citrus,\\nalcohol, chocolate, and coffee. An extract from shiitake\\nmushrooms (LEM) has been shown in Japanese studies\\nto benefit CFS patients.\\nAyurvedic medicine stresses that energy is derived\\nfrom food. Energy-producing foods include: fresh fruits\\nand vegetables, whole milk, wheat and wheat products,\\nrice, barley, honey, olive oil, mung bean soup, raisins,\\ndates, figs, almonds, clarified butter, and yogurt. Foods\\nthat deplete energy include: red meat, aged or fermented\\nfoods, onions,garlic, mushrooms, potatoes, sugar, alco-\\nhol, and coffee.\\nAyurvedic medicine dictates that complete digestion\\nof food is necessary to obtain the maximum amount of\\nenergy. The following measures can be taken to optimize\\ndigestion:\\n• eating in a quiet place\\n• following established mealtimes\\n• sitting while eating\\n• not eating while upset\\n• eating only until satiety (fullness)\\n• avoiding ice cold foods and drinks\\n• not talking while chewing\\n• eating at a moderate pace\\nSupplements\\nThe following supplements have been used in treat-\\ning CFS.\\n• Vitamin B12 deficiency causes fatigue, muscle aches,\\nconfusion, poor memory, and arm and leg numbness.\\n• Magnesium helps muscles to relax.

It is commonly found in England\\nand the United States, and is similar to chamomile in ap-\\npearance. Feverfew differs from chamomile in that it is\\nlarger and the white petals are arranged around a flat yel-\\nlow center, as opposed to conical, which is the case with\\nchamomile. The hairy stems of feverfew grow to about 2\\nft (61 cm) tall, and the leaves are serrated and downy.\\nFeverfew is also known by other common names, includ-\\ning featherfew, featherfoil, flirtwort, bachelor’s buttons,\\nand wild chamomile.\\nOx-eye daisy\\nThe botanical name for the ox-eye daisy is Chrysan-\\nthemum leucanthemum . It is a common sight in Britain,\\nwhere it is known as dun daisy or maudlinwort. It is\\ncommon throughout Europe, Russia, and Asia. Again, it\\nis a yellow-centered flower with white petals. It grows to\\na height of 1-2 ft (30-61 cm) and has small leaves with\\nserrated edges.\\nSunflower\\nThe sunflower is a native of Mexico and Peru, and is\\ncommonly grown in the United States and many other\\nareas of the world. This is the largest of the chrysanthe-\\nmum family, and there are several subspecies, varying\\nslightly in size. Generally it grows to a height of 3-12 ft\\n(91-366 cm), with flower heads that may measure more\\nthan 6 in (15 cm)across. The leaves are serrated and rough.\\nGeneral use\\nThe Flower Essence Society (FES) of California has\\na chrysanthemum essence that they recommend for those\\nseeking spiritual growth.\\nAccording to many herbalists, species of chrysan-\\nthemum have many medicinal uses.\\nDalmatian pellitory\\nThis is commonly known as insect powder due to its\\ninsecticide properties. An advantage is that the powder is\\ncompletely harmless to humans, and so does not have\\nside effects (as is the case with all chemical insecticides),\\nand can be used as a lotion and applied to the skin as an\\ninsect repellant. If the flowers are burned, the smoke that\\nis given off can be valuable in exterminating insects.\\nFeverfew\\nFeverfew is chiefly regarded for its ability to treat\\nfevers, reduce swelling, and for its analgesic properties;\\nit is an excellent cure for a headache or any other pain.\\nIt is also used to promote menstrual flow, as an antidote\\nJua. The plant grows profusely throughout China and is\\nboth an emblem to the Chinese and greatly prized for its\\nmedicinal properties, particularly as an anti-inflammatory.\\nThe best flowers for medicinal purposes are consid-\\nered to be the yellow fragrant ones. They are classified\\nas being acrid, bitter, and slightly cold in the Chinese\\npharmacopoeia. Traditionally, they are harvested in the\\nfall, when they are in full bloom.\\nThe herb is taken internally for headaches, dizzi-\\nness, and hearing disorders. It is also useful as a treat-\\nment for high blood pressure ( hypertension ). It is used\\nas a compress or eye wash for inflammation of the eyes\\nand for other eye problems such as dry-eye, blurred vi-\\nsion, and spots before the eyes. The herb can also be\\ntaken internally as an infusion and is combined with\\nhoneysucklefor the treatment of colds, the flu, and in-\\nfected sores. It has a calming effect and can also be good\\nfor stress. Chrysanthemum is known to be a powerful\\nantiseptic and antibiotic. However, people suffering from\\ndiarrheashould take it with caution.\\nDalmatian pellitory\\nThere are many plants that go by the name of pelli-\\ntory, but this one is also a member of the chrysanthemum\\nfamily. Its botanical name is Chrysanthemum cinerari-\\nafolium, and it originated in Dalmatia. It is cultivated in\\nboth Dalmatia and California.

It has been used as a treatment\\nfor insect bites and even rat bites. In the past, feverfew\\nwas recommended for planting around dwellings be-\\ncause of its antiseptic properties. It wards off disease and\\nprevents pests and diseases from attacking other plants.\\nSimilar to Dalmatian pellitory, it also has a repellant ef-\\nfect on insects. It can be used externally for flatulence\\nand colic.\\nOx-eye daisy\\nThe herb has a soothing effect and is recommended\\nfor night sweats, especially those associated with tuber-\\nculosis. It is recommended for use in cases of whooping\\ncough, asthma, and nervous tension. Generally its action\\ncan be compared to that of chamomile. It is useful for re-\\nlieving chronic coughs and bronchial catarrh. Externally,\\nit can be used as a lotion for wounds, bruises, and some\\nskin conditions. In this regard, some herbalists recom-\\nmend it as an ointment for treating swellings and it is\\nalso known for treating gout. Others recommend it for\\ntreating jaundice and also as a diuretic and tonic.\\nSunflower\\nThe sunflower is chiefly grown for its seeds which\\nproduce an oil, similar to olive oil, that is both cheap to\\nproduce and a valuable source of fatty acids. In many\\nparts of the world, the sunflower provides much needed\\nnutritionin poorer areas. The seeds can be used medici-\\nnally for treatment of bronchial complaints. A tincture of\\nthe seed has been used successfully in areas such as Rus-\\nsia, Turkey, and Persia for fevers (even malaria), where\\nit has been found to be free of the complications some-\\ntimes associated with the use of quinine.\\nPreparations\\nDalmatian pellitory\\nPARTS USED: FLOWERS. The chief use for Dalmatian\\npellitory is as an insecticide, or as an ointment to ward\\noff insects. It is mainly dried and ground to a powder to\\nthis end.\\nFeverfew\\nPARTS USED: BARK, FLOWERS, AND LEAVES. For\\ncoughs it is generally made up into a syrup (decoction)\\nwith sugar or honey. The herb, when bruised and added\\nto a little oil, can be used as an external application for\\nflatulence and colic. For swellings and bites, it can be\\nmade up into a tincture, two teaspoonfuls of which\\nshould be mixed with half a pint of cold water and ap-\\nplied. As an infusion, made with boiling water and al-\\nlowed to cool, feverfew will soothe pain of any kind,\\n(muscular, nerve-related, rheumatic or intestinal). Chew-\\ning the leaves (one to four per day) can be effective in\\nthe case of migraine. It has also been used in this way to\\ntreat cases of worms.\\nOx-eye daisy\\nPARTS USED: FLOWERS, ROOTS, AND LEAVES. This\\nplant is mainly employed as an infusion. But in the case\\nof tuberculosis, 15–60 drops of the fluid-extract should\\nbe taken in water. The flowers boiled with the leaves and\\nstalks and sweetened with a little honey are a treatment\\nfor chest complaints.\\nSunflower\\nPARTS USED: SEEDS AND LEAVES. Chest complaints:\\nboil two ounces of the seeds in one quart of water until\\nthe water is reduced to 12 oz. Strain and add six ounces\\nof Holland gin and six ounces of sugar. The dose is one\\nto two teaspoonfuls of the mixture three times a day.\\nRoasting the seeds and making an infusion is recom-\\nmended for whooping cough.\\nPrecautions\\nAs with any herbal preparations, all of the above\\nshould be used with care and preferably under the super-\\nvision of an herbal practitioner.\\nSide effects\\nFeverfew should not be used for migraine that is a re-\\nsult of some kind of deficiency in the body (whether nu-\\ntritional or otherwise). It is possible that feverfew may\\ncause dermatitis, allergic reactions, or sores in the mouth\\nin susceptible individuals. It should not be taken by preg-\\nnant women due to its ability to stimulate the uterus.\\nInteractions\\nFeverfew has been known to interfere with blood-\\nclotting ability, and so a doctor should be consulted be-\\nfore it is used in conjunction with anticoagulants.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBuchman, Dian Dincin.

It is naturally produced by\\nthe pancreas in the human body. However, it can also be\\ntaken as an enzyme supplement to improve health and\\ndigestion and aid in the treatment of various diseases.\\nThe pancreas, which produces chymotrypsin and\\nother digestive enzymes , is a digestive organ in the ab-\\ndomen that is located just below the stomach. Its primary\\njob is to produce enzymes required for the digestion and\\nabsorption of food. Each day the pancreas secrets about\\n1.5 qt (1.4 L) of pancreatic juice, consisting of enzymes,\\nwater, and electrolytes (primarily bicarbonate) into the\\nsmall intestine. The enzymes are secreted in an inactive\\nform (as proenzymes) so that they will not digest the\\npancreas. The pancreas secretes an inhibitor to ensure\\nthat the enzymes are not activated too early. When the\\npancreatic juice reaches the small intestine, the enzymes\\nbecome activated. The small intestine is not digested be-\\ncause it contains a protective mucous lining. However,\\nself-digestion can occur if the pancreatic duct becomes\\nblocked or if the pancreas is damaged. The proenzymes\\ncan overwhelm the inhibitor, causing the enzymes to be-\\ncome active while in the pancreas. This condition, called\\nacute pancreatitis, can result in a lifetime of pancreatic\\ninsufficiency.\\nThe enzymes secreted by the pancreas break down\\nfood by breaking the chemical bonds that hold food mol-\\necules together. Enzymes secreted include lipase, which,\\nalong with bile, digests fat; amylases, which break down\\nstarch molecules into smaller sugars; and protease,\\nwhich breaks protein molecules into dipeptides and\\nsome single amino acids . In addition to chymotrypsin,\\nother protease enzymes secreted by the pancreas include\\ntrypsin and carboxypeptidase.\\nChymotrypsin, as a hydrolase type of enzyme\\n(which means it adds a water molecule during the break-\\ndown process) acts by catalyzing the hydrolysis of pep-\\ntide bonds of proteins in the small intestine. It is selec-\\ntive for peptide bonds with aromatic or large hydropho-\\nbic side chains on the carboxyl side of this bond. Chy-\\nmotrypsin also catalyzes the hydrolysis of ester bonds.\\nChymotrypsin does not digest blood proteins because of\\nprotective factors in the blood that block the enzyme.\\nGeneral use\\nGenerally, the primary uses of chymotrypsin are as a\\ndigestive aid and as an anti-inflammatory agent. The pres-\\nence and amount of chymotrypsin in a person’s stool is\\nsometimes measured for diagnostic purposes as a test of\\npancreatic function. Testing for fecal chymotrypsin is non-\\ninvasive, unlike some other tests of pancreatic function.\\nChymotrypsin, along with the other pancreatic en-\\nzymes, is most often used in the treatment of pancreatic\\ninsufficiency. Pancreatic insufficiency is characterized\\nby impaired digestion, malabsorption and passing of\\nundigested food into the stool, nutrient deficiencies,gas,\\nand abdominal bloating and discomfort. Pancreatic defi-\\nciency also occurs in persons with cystic fibrosis, a rare\\ninherited disorder. It may also occur in those with chron-\\nic pancreatitis, as well as in the elderly. Other conditions\\nthat could result in chymotrypsin deficiency include\\nphysical injuries, chemotherapy, and chronic stress.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2486\\nChymotrypsin\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nDecoction—These are made to be taken immedi-\\nately (not for storage): simmer herbs for half an\\nhour and strain, in the same way as for syrup, but\\nsweetened to taste only.\\nFluid extract—Made by simmering a plant and re-\\nducing the water until the mixture is thickened.\\nThis resulting liquid has a concentrated form of\\nthe active constituents of a plant.

Protease enzymes and other\\nintestinal secretions are also required to keep the small\\nintestine free from parasites such as bacteria, yeast, pro-\\ntozoa, and intestinal worms. A laboratory analysis of a\\nstool sample along with physical symptoms are used to\\nassess pancreatic function.\\nAs an anti-inflammatory agent, the chymotrypsin\\nand the other protease enzymes prevent tissue damage\\nduring inflammation and the formation of fibrin clots.\\nProtease enzymes participate in the breakdown of fibrin\\nin a process called fibrinolysis. Fibrin causes a wall to\\nform around an area of inflammation, resulting in the\\nblockage of blood and lymph vessels, which leads to\\nswelling. Fibrin can also cause the development of blood\\nclots. In autoimmune diseases, the protease enzymes aid\\nin the breakdown of immune complexes, which are anti-\\nbodies produced by the immune system associated with\\nthe compounds they bind to (antigens). High levels of\\nimmune complexes in the blood are associated with au-\\ntoimmune diseases.\\nSpecifically, chymotrypsin is used to:\\n• Aid in digestion.\\n• Treat inflammation and reduce swelling (i.e., soft tissue\\ninjuries, acute traumatic injuries, sprains, contusions,\\nhematomas, ecchymoses,infections, edema of the eye-\\nlids and genitalia, muscle cramps, and sports injuries).\\n• Treat arthritis and such other autoimmune diseases as\\nlupus, scleroderma, and multiple sclerosis.\\n• Treat ulcerations and abscesses.\\n• Liquefy mucus secretions.\\n• Treat enterozoic worms and other parasites in the di-\\ngestive tract.\\n• Treat cancer (a controversial use that requires much\\nmore scientific study, though chymotrypsin may be\\nhelpful in alleviating effects of radiation treatment or\\nchemotherapy).\\n• Treat shingles and acne.\\n• Decrease effects of sun damage and age spots.\\nPreparations\\nChymotrypsin is produced from fresh hog, beef, or\\noxen pancreas. It can be taken orally, topically, or by in-\\njection (by injection only by a physician in severe life-\\nthreatening situations), but is commonly taken orally in\\ntablet form. As a tablet, it may be uncoated, microencap-\\nsulated, or enterically coated (to prevent digestion in the\\nstomach so that the enzyme will be released in the small\\nintestine). Other forms include coated granules, powder,\\ncapsules, and liquids. Creams and ointments are used to\\nbreak down proteins and debride dead tissue resulting\\nfrom burns, wounds, and abscesses. The enzyme prepa-\\nration should be stored in a tight container with a mois-\\nture-proof liner in a dry, cool place. An opened container\\nstored properly should maintain enzyme activity for\\nabout two to three months.\\nUsually chymotrypsin is included in a combination\\nwith other enzymes. A typical formulation may include:\\nchymotrypsin (0.5–1 mg),bromelain (a plant protease)\\n(25–45 mg), pancreatin (a mixture of many pancreatic\\nenzymes) (100 mg), papain (a plant protease similar in\\naction to chymotrypsin) (25–60 mg), and trypsin (a pan-\\ncreatic protease) (24 mg). Formulations may also include\\nvitamins, herbs, phytochemicals, and other nutrients to\\nenhance the activity of the enzyme supplement.\\nEnzyme activity should be considered when a sup-\\nplement is selected. Activity is usually indicated in units;\\nhowever there is no one standard for enzyme activity\\nlevel. Recognized guidelines for measuring enzyme ac-\\ntivity include Food Chemicals Codex (FCC), United\\nStates Pharmacopoeia (USP), Federation Internationale\\ndu Pharmaceutiques (FIP), British Pharmacopoeia (BP),\\nand Japanese Pharmacopoeia (JP). For example, the\\nUnited States Pharmacopoeia has set a strict definition\\nfor level of activity that must be reported in a enzyme\\nsupplement. A 1X chymotrypsin product must contain\\nnot less than 25 USP units for chymotrypsin activity. A\\npreparation of higher potency is given a whole number\\nmultiple indicating its strength. For example, a full-\\nstrength undiluted extract that is 10 times stronger than\\nthe USP standard would be referred to as 10X USP. A\\nconsumer can compare enzyme activity levels among en-\\nzyme products within a single guideline system, but un-\\nfortunately the information is not interchangeable among\\nguideline systems.\\nThe dose required will vary on the quantity (amount\\nin mg) and the quality (activity level) of the enzyme in\\nthe preparation, which is usually tablet form. The dose\\nwill also depend on the condition being treated. In most\\ncases, for oral ingestion and for topical application, the\\ndirections on the bottle or tube label can be followed.\\nEnterically coated tables should be swallowed and not\\nchewed or ground up. Tablets should also be taken with\\nat least 8 oz of water to help activate the enzyme.

Those with chronic conditions such as arthri-\\ntis may require one to three months or more to notice a\\nchange in conditions.\\nPrecautions\\nChymotrypsin is generally well tolerated and not as-\\nsociated with any significant side effects. However, since\\na safe dose has not been established, it should only be\\nused when there is apparent need.\\nPeople who should not use enzyme therapy include\\nthose with hereditary clotting disorders such as hemo-\\nphilia, those suffering from coagulation disturbances,\\nthose who are just about to or have undergone surgery,\\nthose on anticoagulant therapy, anyone suffering from\\nprotein allergies, and pregnant women or those breast-\\nfeeding. Since there is not much known about the effects\\nof enzyme therapy on children, it would be prudent to\\navoid giving enzyme supplements to children.\\nWhen protective mechanisms against self-digestion\\nin the body break down, chymotrypsin should not be\\nused. For example, if a patient has stomach ulcers, chy-\\nmotrypsin therapy should be discontinued.\\nSide effects\\nThere do not appear to be any long-term side effects\\nfrom chymotrypsin therapy if precautions for its use are fol-\\nlowed.

It is extracted from\\nor prepared by grinding the empty shell shed every seven\\nyears by the cicada, (Cryptotympana atrata or Crypto-\\ntympana pustulata), which is a winged insect that makes\\na distinctive chirping sound, and belongs to the Cicadi-\\ndae family.\\nCicadas are commonly found in mainland China,\\nTaiwan, and Japan. They had religious significance in\\nancient China, and symbolized reincarnation or immor-\\ntality, as the Chinese compared the cicada’s periodic\\nmolting of its shell with a person’s leaving the physical\\nbody behind at the time of death. Bronze vessels as old\\nas 1500 B.C. ornamented with cicadas have been found in\\nChinese tombs, along with white pottery and jewelry\\nfeaturing cicada designs. During the Han dynasty (202\\nB.C. to A.D.) 220, the Chinese carved small cicadas out of\\nprecious jade and placed them in the mouths of the dead.\\nThe pharmaceutical name of the substance made\\nfrom this insect is Periostracum cicadae , or chan tui in\\nChinese. It is prepared from the exuvium, or cast-off\\nshell of the nymph form of the insect. The empty shell is\\nshiny, translucent, and yellow-brown in color. As it\\nwould appear in a living cicada, the shell has three por-\\ntions: head (with two eyes), chest (with wings and a\\ncrossed gap), and abdomen (with three pairs of feet).\\nGeneral use\\nThe medicinal uses of cicada include treatment of\\nfever and associated seizures; skin rashes; and such eye\\ndisorders as conjunctivitis, cataracts, and blurred vision.\\nDue to its antipyretic effect, cicada-containing\\npreparations are often used to treat high fevers, such as\\nthose associated with the common cold or influenza .\\nWestern news media reported in April 2003 that the Chi-\\nnese were using combinations of cicada and silkworm\\ndroppings to treat the fever associated with SARS. In ad-\\ndition to reducing fever, cicada is also used in TCM to\\ntreat other symptoms of colds and flu, including laryngi-\\ntis, headache, restless sleep, or nightmares.\\nCicada is said to be effective in relieving itchy rash-\\nes and eczema. Its special use is for the treatment of\\nrashes or skin eruptions that occur in the early stages of\\nmeaslesor chicken pox. According to traditional Chi-\\nnese medicine, the sooner the rashes appear, the shorter\\nand less severe these diseases will be. Therefore, a Chi-\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 489'),\n",

It may\\nalso delay transmission of nerve signals at the neuromus-\\ncular junction, thereby reducing muscle spasms. Its ac-\\ntions may be similar to those of Western barbiturates,\\nsedatives, and anticonvulsants (antiseizure medications).\\nCicada has also been used in TCM to treat eye dis-\\neases associated with wind and heat, including blurred\\nvision and conjunctivitis (inflammation of the membrane\\nthat lines the eyelids). It is usually mixed with chrysan-\\nthemum flowers (Chrysanthemum morifolium , or ju hua\\nin Chinese) when used to treat cataracts.\\nPreparations\\nThe usual dosage of cicada when taken alone is 3–9\\ngrams per day. As of 2004, whole cicadas cost about 10\\ncents per gram when purchased in bulk from suppliers of\\nChinese medicinal herbs. Cicada may be prepared as a\\ndecoction, which means that the insect shells are boiled\\ndown to a concentrated broth or tea to be taken internal-\\nly. Other forms of cicada preparations include ground\\npowder and water and alcohol extracts.\\nPrecautions\\nA general precaution when using herbs or other alter-\\nnative medicines is to purchase them only from reputable\\nsources. In the case of traditional Chinese remedies, this\\nprecaution is particularly important because many of them\\nare imported from countries without strict production or\\nlabeling standards. In the case of cicada, the United States\\nFood and Drug Administration (FDA) reported in June\\n2003 that a shipment described as “Cicada Molting Herbal\\nFood Supplement” from Taiwan was refused entry into the\\nUnited States and considered dangerous. In this instance,\\nthe FDA defined “dangerous” in these terms: “The article\\nappears to be dangerous to health when used in the dosage\\nor manner, or with the frequency or duration, prescribed,\\nrecommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.”\\nPractitioners of TCM state that pregnant women\\nshould not use cicada because of the risk of miscarriage.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects from cicada preparations have been\\nreported in the United States as of early 2004.\\nInteractions\\nAs of 2004, cicada decoctions have not been report-\\ned to interact with any Western prescription medications.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBensky, Dan, and Andrew Gamble.

The tree\\nhas thick, reddish brown bark, small yellow flowers, and\\nits leathery leaves have a spicy smell. It grows to a height\\nof approximately 20-60 ft (8-18 m) and is found primari-\\nly in tropical forests. Cinnamon bark belongs to the Lau-\\nraceae family. Related species are Cinnamomum cassia\\nand Cinnamomum saigonicum (Saigon Cinnamon).\\nCinnamon bark is cultivated in such tropical regions as\\nthe Philippines and the West Indies. It is not grown in the\\nUnited States. Every two years the trees are cut to just\\nabove ground level. The bark is harvested from the new\\nshoots, then dried. The outer bark is stripped away, leaving\\nthe inner bark, which is the main medicinal part of the herb.\\nThe use of cinnamon dates back thousands of years\\nto at least 2700 B.C. Chinese herbals from that time men-\\ntioned it as a treatment for fever, diarrhea, and menstru-\\nal problems. Indian Ayurvedic healers used it in a similar\\nmanner. Cinnamon was introduced around 500 B.C. to the\\nEgyptians, who then added it to their embalming mix-\\ntures. Hebrews, Greeks, and Romans used it as a spice,\\nperfume, and for indigestion. Moses included cinnamon\\nin an anointing oil that he used. By the seventeenth centu-\\nry, cinnamon was considered a culinary spice by Euro-\\npeans. American nineteenth century physicians pre-\\nscribed cinnamon as a treatment for stomach cramps,\\nnausea, vomiting, diarrhea, colic, and uterine problems.\\nGeneral use\\nCinnamon bark is a common ingredient in many\\nproducts such as toothpaste, mouthwash, perfume, soap,\\nlipstick, chewing gum, cough syrup, nasal sprays, and\\ncola drinks. A popular food flavoring, it is valued as one\\nof the world’s most important spices. It is also valuable\\nin the treatment of various ailments. Modern herbalists\\nprescribe cinnamon bark as a remedy for nausea, vomit-\\ning, diarrhea, and indigestion. Chinese herbalists recom-\\nmend it for asthma brought on by cold, some digestive\\nproblems, backache, and menstrual problems.\\nThe medicinal value of the herb is attributed to the\\noil extracted from the inner bark and leaves. The cinna-\\nmon bark harvested from the young branches is primari-\\nly used for culinary purposes. In fact, the cinnamon\\nsticks commonly used in cooking are actually pieces of\\nrolled outer bark.\\nThe active ingredients of the bark contain antibacte-\\nrial, antiseptic, antiviral, antispasmodic, and antifungal\\nproperties. A study published in 2002 indicates that oil\\nfrom cinnamon bark inhibits the production of listeri-\\nolysin, a protein released by Listeria bacteria that de-\\nstroys healthy cells. Japanese research has shown cin-\\nnamaldehyde, one of the constituents of cinnamon bark,\\nto be sedative and analgesic. Eugenol, another compo-\\nnent, contains pain-relieving qualities.\\nCinnamon bark is helpful in strengthening and sup-\\nporting a weak digestive system. Research reports that\\ncinnamon bark breaks down fats in the digestive system,\\nmaking it a valuable digestive aid. It is used to treat nau-\\nsea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach ulcers, acid indigestion,\\nheartburn, lack of appetite, and abdominal disorders.\\nA traditional stimulant in Chinese medicine, cinna-\\nmon bark has a warming effect on the body and is used for\\nconditions caused by coldness. The twigs of cinnamon en-\\nhance circulation, especially to the fingers and toes.\\nCinnamon bark contains antiseptic properties that\\nhelp to prevent infection by killing decay-causing bacte-\\nria, fungi, and viruses. One German study showed that\\nthe use of cinnamon bark suppressed the cause of most\\nurinary tract infections and the fungus responsible for\\nvaginal yeast infections. It is also helpful in relieving\\nathlete’s foot.\\nCinnamon bark is a frequent ingredient in tooth-\\npaste, mouthwash, and other oral hygiene products be-\\ncause it helps kill the bacteria that causes tooth decay\\nand gum disease. Inflammations of the throat and phar-\\nynx may be relieved through its use.\\nCinnamon bark is also known to control blood sugar\\nlevels in diabetics. United States Department of Agricul-\\nture (USDA) researchers have found that cinnamon bark\\nmay reduce the amount of insulin required for glucose\\nmetabolism.

There are different types of cir-\\nrhosis that could afflict a person.\\nDescription\\nCirrhosis changes the structure of the liver and the\\nblood vessels that nourish it. The disease reduces the\\nliver’s ability to manufacture proteins, complex carbohy-\\ndrates, fats,cholesterol, and to process hormones, nutri-\\nents, medications, and poisons. Cirrhosis worsens over\\ntime and can become potentially life threatening.\\nCirrhosis is the seventh leading cause of disease-re-\\nlated death in the United States. It is the third most com-\\nmon cause of death in adults between the ages of 45 and\\n65. It is twice as common in men as in women. The dis-\\nease occurs in more than half of all malnourished chron-\\nic alcoholics, and kills about 25,000 people a year. In\\nAsia and Africa, however, most deaths from cirrhosis are\\ndue to chronic hepatitis B.\\nskin. External application of the oil may cause redness\\nand burning of skin.\\n• Cinnamon bark should not be given to children under\\ntwo years of age.\\n• Cinnamon bark is considered toxic if taken in excess.\\n• Cinnamon bark should not be given to persons with in-\\nflammatory liver disease; in large quantities, it can irri-\\ntate the liver.\\nSide effects\\nMild side effects include stomach upset, sweating,\\nand diarrhea. Large doses can cause changes in breath-\\ning, dilation of blood vessels, sleepiness,depression,o r\\nconvulsions. Excessive use of cinnamon bark may cause\\nred, tender gums; mouth ulcers; inflamed taste buds; and\\na severe burning sensation in the mouth.\\nInteractions\\nSome interactions with other medications have been\\nreported. Cinnamon oil may cause skin irritation if ap-\\nplied to the skin together with acne medications that\\ncontain retinoic acid. Cinnamon bark has also been re-\\nported to intensify the effects of medications given to\\nlower blood pressure. Persons taking cinnamon bark\\nshould discontinue its use two weeks before any surgery\\nrequiring general anesthesia because of the herb’s ten-\\ndency to lower blood pressure.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nChevalier, Andrew The Encyclopedia of Medicinal Plants.

As of\\n2003, cirrhosis resulting from chronic hepatitis has\\nemerged as a leading cause of death among HIV-positive\\npatients; in Europe, about 30% of HIV-positive patients\\nare coinfected with a hepatitis virus.\\nLiver injury, reactions to prescription medications,\\ncertain autoimmune disorders, exposure to toxic sub-\\nstances, and repeated episodes of heart failure with liver\\ncongestion can cause cirrhosis. A family history of dis-\\neases can genetically predispose a person to develop cir-\\nrhosis. These are:\\n• a lack of a specific liver enzyme (alpha1-antitrypsin de-\\nficiency)\\n• the absence of a milk-digesting enzyme (galactosemia)\\n• an inability to convert sugars to energy (glycogen stor-\\nage disease)\\n• an absorption deficit in which excess iron is deposited\\nin the liver, pancreas, heart, and other organs\\n• a disorder characterized by accumulations of copper in\\nthe liver, brain, kidneys, and corneas (Wilson’s disease)\\nObesity has recently been recognized as a risk fac-\\ntor in nonalcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis. Some sur-\\ngeons are recommending as of 2003 that patients sched-\\nuled for weight-reduction surgery have a liver biopsy to\\nevaluate the possibility of liver damage.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of cirrhosis are usually caused by the\\nloss of functioning liver cells or organ swelling due to\\nscarring. The liver enlarges during the early stages of ill-\\nness. Patients may experience:\\n• anemia\\n• bleeding gums\\n• constipation\\n• decreased interest in sex\\n• diarrhea\\n• dull abdominal pain\\n• extremely dry skin and intense itching\\n• fatigue\\n• fever\\n• fluid in the lungs\\n• hallucinations\\n• indigestion\\n• lethargy\\n• lightheadedness\\nTypes of cirrhosis\\n• Portal, or nutritional cirrhosis. The most common form\\nof the disease in the United States. About 30–50% of\\nall cases of cirrhosis are this type. Nine out of every 10\\npeople who have nutritional cirrhosis have a history of\\nalcoholism. Portal cirrhosis is also called Laënnec’s\\ncirrhosis.\\n• Biliary cirrhosis. Caused by liver bile-duct diseases that\\nimpede bile flow. Bile is formed in the liver and carried\\nvia the ducts to the intestines. Bile then helps digest\\nfats in the intestines. Biliary cirrhosis can scar or block\\nthese ducts. It represents 15–20% of all cirrhosis.\\n• Postnecrotic cirrhosis. Caused by chronic infections .\\nThis form of the disease affects up to 40% of all pa-\\ntients who have cirrhosis.\\n• Pigment cirrhosis (hemochromatosis). Disorders like\\nthe inability to metabolize iron and similar disorders\\nmay cause pigment cirrhosis, which accounts for\\n5–10% of all instances of the disease.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses and risk factors\\nLong-term alcoholism is the primary cause of cir-\\nrhosis in the United States. Men and women respond dif-\\nferently to alcohol. Although most men can safely con-\\nsume two to five drinks a day, one to two drinks a day\\ncan cause liver damage in women. Individual tolerance\\nto alcohol varies, but people who drink more and drink\\nmore often have a higher risk of developing cirrhosis. In\\nsome people, one drink a day can cause liver scarring.\\nChronic liver infections, such as hepatitis B and par-\\nticularly hepatitis C, are commonly linked to cirrhosis.\\nPeople at high risk of contracting hepatitis B include\\nthose exposed to the virus through contact with blood\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 494'),\n",

The\\npatient may become forgetful and unresponsive, neglect\\npersonal care, have trouble concentrating, and acquire\\nnew sleeping habits. These symptoms are related to am-\\nmonia intoxication and the failure of the liver to convert\\nammonia to urea. High protein intake in these patients\\ncan also lead to these symptoms.\\nCirrhosis worsens over time and can become poten-\\ntially life-threatening. This disease can cause:\\n• excessive bleeding (hemorrhage)\\n• impotence\\n• liver cancer\\n• coma due to accumulated ammonia and body wastes\\n(liver failure)\\n• sepsis (blood poisoning)\\n• death\\nDiagnosis\\nA patient’s medical history can reveal illnesses or\\nlifestyles likely to lead to cirrhosis. Liver changes can be\\nseen during a physical examination. A doctor who sus-\\npects cirrhosis may order blood and urine tests to measure\\nliver function. Because only a small number of healthy\\ncells are needed to carry out essential liver functions, test\\nresults may be normal even when cirrhosis is present.\\nIn about 10 out of every 100 patients, the cause of cir-\\nrhosis cannot be determined. Many people who have cir-\\nrhosis do not have any symptoms (often called compensat-\\ned cirrhosis). Their disease is detected during a routine\\nphysical or when tests for an unrelated medical problem\\nare performed. This type of cirrhosis can also be detected\\nwhen complications occur (decompensated cirrhosis).\\nComputed tomography scans (CT), ultrasound, and\\nother imaging techniques can be used during diagnosis.\\nThey can help determine the size of the liver, indicate\\nhealthy and scarred areas of the organ, and detect gall-\\nstones. Cirrhosis is sometimes diagnosed during surgery\\nor by examining the liver with a laparoscope. This view-\\ning device is inserted into the patient’s body through a\\ntiny incision in the abdomen.\\nLiver biopsy is usually needed to confirm a diagno-\\nsis of cirrhosis. In this procedure, a tissue sample is re-\\nmoved from the liver and examined under a microscope\\nin order to learn more about the organ’s condition and to\\nproperly diagnose it.\\nA newer and less invasive test involves the measure-\\nment of hyaluronic acid in the patient’s blood serum. As\\nof 2003, however, the serum hyaluronic acid test is most\\nuseful in monitoring the progress of liver disease; it is\\nunlikely to completely replace liver biopsy in the diagno-\\nsis of cirrhosis.\\nTreatment\\nBefore starting on any alternative treatment pro-\\ngram, patients should consult their doctor for monitoring\\nof side effects and effectiveness of treatment. Any nutri-\\ntional changes should be discussed with the primary care\\nprovider. Alternative treatments that may be of help to\\ncirrhotic patients include nutritional and juice therapy,\\nWestern herbal therapy,traditional Chinese medicine ,\\nand homeopathy.\\nNutritional therapy\\nTo support liver function and slow down disease pro-\\ngression, a naturopath may recommend the following:\\n• Avoid liver toxins.

In addition, even over-the-\\ncounter drugs, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), should\\nbe avoided because they can be toxic in cirrhotic patients.\\n• Juice therapy helps the liver detoxify toxins from the\\nbody. Patients should mix one part of pure juice with\\none part of water before drinking.\\n• Eat smaller meals. To avoid overworking the liver, five\\nor six smaller, lighter meals per day are recommended.\\n• Avoid fatty foods, especially those prepared with animal\\nfats or hydrogenated oils and processed foods. These\\ntypes of foods put additional demands on the liver.\\n• Eat only lean proteins (containing no fats) and in limit-\\ned amounts. Vegetable proteins, such as those found in\\nlegumes or tofu, and whole grains are preferred. High\\nprotein intake causes increases in ammonia levels in\\nthe blood, possibly resulting in mental confusion, and\\nin severe cases, coma. However, do not severely limit\\nprotein intake, as this may cause protein deficiency and\\nimpair healing process.\\n• Increase consumption of fruits and steamed vegetables.\\nFruits and vegetables are easy to digest, thus less work\\nfor the liver. In addition, they are good sources of vita-\\nmins, minerals, and antioxidants that help the liver\\ndetoxify and heal.\\n• Practice intermittent fasting.\\n• Take supplements that can improve digestion and help\\nthe liver heal and prevent further injury to the liver.\\nThey include pancreatic enzymes,milk thistle (Sily-\\nbum marianum ), lipotropic agents such as vitamin B 6,\\nvitamin B12, folic acid, choline, alpha lipoic acid, be-\\ntaine, and methionine.\\nIn 2001, several studies were compared to determine\\nthe effectiveness of milk thistle in treating cirrhosis and\\nother liver diseases. The active component in milk this-\\ntle, silymarin, promotes liver protein synthesis. Studies\\nappear to show improved survival among cirrhosis pa-\\ntients who use milk thistle (study subjects received 140\\nmg of silymarin three times a day).\\nOther therapies\\nOther types of therapies the patient may want to\\nconsider are naturopathic hydrotherapy , and ones that\\nmay improve immune function, including stress reduc-\\ntion, guided imagery, and massage.\\nTraditional Chinese medicine\\nDepending on a patient’s specific condition, an ex-\\npert Chinese herbalist may prescribe herbal remedies\\nthat may help improve liver function. Animal studies\\nhave shown that the following Chinese herbs may have\\nprotective effects on the liver:\\n• Propolis\\n• Bupleurum chinense is the most frequently used herb\\nfor a variety of liver diseases\\n• Phellodendron wilsonii\\n• Clementis chinensis\\n• Solanum incanum\\n• Ixeris chinensis\\n• Gardenia jasminoides\\nWestern herbal therapy\\nPatients should consult an experienced herbalist for\\nspecific herbal treatments. There has also been moderate\\nevidence regarding the use of milk thistle in helping to\\nalter the effects of cirrhosis; however, there is no conclu-\\nsive data as of 2002.\\nHomeopathy\\nFor homeopathic therapy, patients should consult a\\nhomeopathic physician who will prescribe specific reme-\\ndies based on knowledge of the underlying cause.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe goal of treatment is to cure or reduce the condi-\\ntion causing cirrhosis, prevent or delay disease progres-\\nsion, and prevent or treat complications.\\nSalt and fluid intake is often limited, and activity is\\nencouraged. A diet high in calories and moderately high in\\nprotein can benefit some patients. Tube feedings or vita-\\nmin supplements may be prescribed if the liver continues\\nto deteriorate.

The herb has been a popular remedy in\\nAsian folk medicine for millennia, being first described\\nabout 2,000 years ago in the Chinese herbal classic Shen\\nNong Ben Cao Jing . Cnidium’s reputation for treating\\nitchy skin conditions persists to this day. Only the seeds\\nand essential oil of Cnidium monnieri, which belongs to\\nthe Apiaceae family, are used as a drug.\\nThe seeds, which are also referred as she chuang zi\\nor she chuang dze , are somewhat yellow in color and\\nhave a sweet smell. They are believed to have several im-\\nportant therapeutic properties, including antibacterial, an-\\ntifungal, and astringent effects. Some of these claims\\nhave been supported by animal and laboratory studies. In\\none test tube investigation, published in the Chinese jour-\\nnal Chung Kuo Chung Yao Tsa Chihin 1991, researchers\\ndemonstrated that Cnidium monnieri was effective\\nagainst several strains of bacteria and fungi. Cnidium\\nmonnieri also appears to have anti-pruritic activity, mean-\\ning that the herb may help to alleviate itching. In a study\\nof mice, published in the Japanese journal Biological &\\nPharmaceutical Bulletin in 2000, cnidium was shown to\\nsignificantly reduce the itch-scratch response in rodents.\\nIn the somewhat ethereal parlance of Chinese folk\\nmedicine—in which diseases are often believed to occur\\ndue to disruptions in the flow of bodily energy—cnidium\\nseeds are considered warm, bitter, and acrid. The essen-\\ntial oils derived from the seeds include camphene, bor-\\nneol, pinene, and terpineol.\\nGeneral use\\nWhile not approved by the FDA, cnidium seeds\\nhave been reported to have several beneficial effects. Be-\\ncause the seeds have not been extensively studied in peo-\\nple, their effectiveness is based mainly on animal studies\\nand their ancient reputation as a folk remedy in China.

It is also thought to be helpful\\nin the treatment of vaginitis and vaginal discharge. Cni-\\ndium is used externally for all the purposes mentioned\\nabove. The seeds may also be taken internally to treat\\nimpotenceas well as infertility in both sexes.\\nCnidium has shown some intriguing activity against\\nasthma and osteoporosis in animal studies, though the\\nclinical implications of these findings are not yet known.\\nIn one investigation, published in the Chinese journal\\nChung-kuo Chung Ya Yao Tsa Chihin 1990, chemicals in\\nCnidium monnieri called coumarins appeared to protect\\nguinea pigs from the effects of bronchial asthma, which\\nthe animals experienced after inhaling histamine. The re-\\nsearchers also demonstrated that the coumarins can relax\\nthe tracheal muscles of guinea pigs in test tube experi-\\nments. A possible link between cnidium and osteoporo-\\nsis was examined in two rodent studies published in the\\nChinese journal Chung-kuo Yao Li Hsueh Pao in 1994\\nand 1997. Both studies suggest that cnidium can help to\\nprevent osteoporosis induced by glucocorticoid drugs.\\nPreparations\\nThe optimum dosage of cnidium seeds has not been\\nestablished with any certainty. Dosage may range from\\n3-12 g. Because cnidium seeds have been recommended\\nfor a variety of purposes, and can be used internally and\\nexternally, consumers are advised to consult a doctor ex-\\nperienced in the use of alternative remedies or Chinese\\nmedicine to determine proper dosage.\\nTo treat skin conditions, the herb is usually applied\\nto the skin in the form of a solution or ointment. Vagini-\\ntis and vaginal discharge are treated with a douche pre-\\npared from the seeds.\\nIn Chinese folk medicine, cnidium seeds are often\\ncombined with other herbs or minerals. When used ex-\\nternally, the seeds may be mixed with stemona and\\nsophora for itchy, oozing skin lesions or with calomel for\\nscabies and eczema (including genital eczema). Taken\\ninternally, cnidium seeds are often combined with\\nschisandraor cuscuta to treat impotence or infertility.\\nCnidium seeds are generally available in bulk or in\\ncombination products (such as powders or pills) that\\ncontain several different herbs.\\nPrecautions\\nCnidium seeds are not known to be harmful when\\ntaken in recommended dosages, though it is important to\\nremember that the long-term effects of taking the seeds\\n(in any amount) have not been investigated. Due to lack\\nof sufficient medical study, cnidium seeds should be used\\nwith caution in children, women who are pregnant or\\nbreast-feeding, and people with liver or kidney disease.\\nCnidium seeds should not be applied to skin that is\\nhot, dry, and sore.\\nDo not confuse cnidium seeds with the essential oil\\nderived from them. While the seeds may be taken inter-\\nnally, the essential oil should not be ingested except\\nunder the supervision of a doctor.\\nWhile cnidium has shown some activity against\\nbronchial asthma and osteoporosis in animal studies, it is\\nnot yet recommended for either of these conditions. Both\\ndiseases are potentially serious and require a doctor’s care.\\nSide effects\\nWhen taken in recommended dosages, cnidium\\nseeds are not associated with any bothersome or signifi-\\ncant side effects.\\nInteractions\\nCnidium seeds should not be used at the same time\\nas croton seeds, fritillaria , or peony root, according to\\npractitioners of Chinese folk medicine. When used exter-\\nnally, cnidium seeds have been combined with stemona,\\nsophora, and calomel without apparent harm. When used\\ninternally, the seeds have been safely mixed with schis-\\nandra and cuscuta.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEditors of Time-Life Books.

Codonopsis is a small perennial\\nnative to Asia. It is especially abundant in the Shanxi and\\nSzechuan provinces of China. Codonopsis grows to a\\nheight of about 5 ft (1.5 m) in dense brushy thickets and\\nat the edges of woods where the soil remains moist.\\nCodonopsis is well known in Chinese herbalism. Its Chi-\\nnese name is tang shen . The plant is also cultivated in\\nmany other parts of the world, including the United\\nStates, because of its distinctive bell-shaped greenish-\\npurple flowers. Other names for codonopsis include bas-\\ntard ginseng and bonnet bellflower.\\nGeneral use\\nCodonopsis, or tang shen , has been used in China\\nfor more than 2,000 years. It is one of the best-known\\nand most widely used herbs in Chinese medicine. In the\\nChinese system of health, the yin aspects of nature,\\nwhich have to do with cold, moisture, dark, and passivi-\\nty, must be kept in balance with the yang aspects, which\\nhave to do with heat, dryness, light, and activity. Ill\\nhealth occurs when the energies and elements of the\\nbody are out of balance with nature or in interior dishar-\\nmony. Health is restored by taking herbs and treatments\\nthat restore this balance. In traditional Chinese medi-\\ncine, codonopsis is said to have a neutral nature and a\\nsweet taste. It is used as a tonic for the lungs and spleen\\nand to strengthen and nourish the blood and balance\\nmetabolic function.\\nLike ginseng, codonopsis is an adaptogen. Adapto-\\ngens are substances that non-specifically enhance and reg-\\nulate the body’s ability to withstand stress. They increase\\nthe body’s general performance in ways that help the\\nwhole body resist disease. Codonopsis is thought to bene-\\nfit the entire body by boosting strength, increasing stami-\\nna and alertness, rejuvenating the body, strengthening the\\nimmune system, aiding recovery from chronic illness, re-\\nducing stress, and stimulating the appetite. It belongs to a\\nclass of herbs called stomachics, which means that they\\ntonify the stomach to improve digestive functions.\\nCodonopsis is sometimes called the “poor man’s gin-\\nseng.” It is often substituted in Chinese herbal formulas\\nfor ginseng, although it has a milder action that lasts for a\\nshorter time. Scientists have shown that the actions of\\nginseng and codonopsis, although similar, are caused by\\nvery different chemical compounds. This type of substitu-\\ntion based on function rather than chemical structure,\\nhowever, is considered acceptable in Chinese medicine.\\nIn addition to the whole-body effects of codonopsis,\\nthe herb is used for a number of other specific conditions.\\nIt can be taken internally, in various combinations with\\nother herbs, for anemia; asthma; cancer; diarrhea;\\nheadaches, especially tension headaches; hemorrhoids;\\nhigh blood pressure; mucus in the lungs and shortness of\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2500\\nCodonopsis root\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAstringent—An agent that helps to contract tissue\\nand prevent the secretion of internal body fluids\\nsuch as blood or mucus.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 518}, page_content='Coenzyme Q10\\nDescription\\nCoenzyme Q 10 is a fat-soluble nutrient also known\\nas CoQ10, vitamin Q10, ubidecarenone, or ubiquinone. It\\nis a natural product of the human body that is primarily\\nfound in the mitochondria, which are the cellular or-\\nganelles that produce energy. It occurs in most tissues of\\nthe human body; however, the highest concentrations are\\nfound in the heart, liver, kidneys, and pancreas.\\nUbiquinone takes its name from a combination of the\\nword ubiquitous, meaning something that is found\\neverywhere, and quinone 10. Quinones are substances\\nfound in all plants and animals. The variety found in hu-\\nmans has a 10-unit side chain in its molecular structure.\\nApart from the important process that provides energy,\\nCoQ10 also stabilizes cell membranes and acts as an an-\\ntioxidant. In this capacity, it destroys free radicals, which\\nare unstable molecules that can damage normal cells.\\nGeneral use\\nCoQ10 is used extensively in Canada, Western Eu-\\nrope, Japan, and Russia to treat congestive heart failure.\\nIt is available as a prescription medication almost every-\\nwhere it is sold, although it is sold over-the-counter as a\\nnutritional supplement in the United States. Some stud-\\nies have shown it to be effective for as many as 70% of\\npatients with congestive heart failure. It appears to im-\\nprove patient health and wellbeing, and to increase car-\\ndiac efficiency. The dosage generally recommended for\\nthis condition is 100–300 mg a day, preferably in divided\\ndoses. According to Dr. Karl Folkers in Prevention’s\\nHealing with Vitamins , it takes one to three months to\\nachieve desired results from supplementation, and as\\nlong as six months to attain maximum benefit.\\nCoQ10 may also help people with some forms of car-\\ndiomyopathy. Patients should consult their physician about\\nthe possible benefits of supplementation for this condition.\\nThe usefulness of CoQ10 in lowering blood pressure\\nis not well documented. One study suggests that the sup-\\nplement is helpful for hypertension, but the results are in\\nquestion as it was not a double-blind, controlled research\\nproject. The dose recommended is 200–250 mg a day,\\nwith results taking several months to appear. It is possible\\nthat some patients with essential hypertension who are ini-\\ntially low in CoQ10 may eventually be able to decrease the\\namount of their other blood pressure medications. This\\nmust be done under the care of a health care provider.\\nOral supplementation of CoQ 10 has been shown to\\nimprove periodontal disease, as it decreases the size of\\nabnormally deep pockets in the gums, and also reduces\\nthe extent of bacterial contamination. Other possible\\nbenefits of CoQ10 are to decrease angina symptoms, im-\\nprove immune function in patients with AIDS and other\\nimmune deficiencies, improve control of blood sugar,\\nlower cholesterol , improve physical stamina, and help\\npeople with muscular dystrophy and Huntington’s dis-\\nease. A group of researchers at the University of Califor-\\nnia at San Diego reported in 2002 that coenzyme Q10 ap-\\npears to slow the progress of Parkinson’s disease ,\\nFriedreich’s ataxia, and other conditions marked by de-\\ngeneration of the central nervous system. The supple-\\nment can also reduce the toxicity of some types of\\nchemotherapy. Doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic agent,\\nis known to sometimes damage the heart. Concomitant\\nsupplementation seems to reduce this toxic effect. The\\npossible benefits of CoQ10 should be discussed with a\\nnutritionally-oriented health care provider.\\nSince 1961, when it was first noticed that cancer pa-\\ntients in Sweden and the United States had low levels of\\nthe enzyme, coenzyme Q10 has been studied as a possible\\ncancer treatment. Researchers believe that coenzyme Q10\\nmay protect against cancer by stimulating the immune\\nsystem, and functioning as an antioxidant. Although ani-\\nmal studies have been conducted, as of early 2004 no re-\\nport of a randomized clinical trial involving human sub-\\njects whose survival times were lengthened by using coen-\\nzyme Q10 in addition to a traditional cancer treatment has\\nbeen reported in a peer-reviewed medical journal.\\nDeficiency\\nPatients with certain conditions tend to have lower\\nlevels of CoQ 10, and may benefit from supplements.\\nSome diseases that are associated with decreased\\namounts of this nutrient are AIDS, chronic fatigue, con-\\ngestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and inflammatory\\ngum disease. Levels of CoQ10 tend to decrease with age;\\ntests for its presence in the body are not widely available.\\nAdverse effects from this supplement are rare and mild,\\nso anyone suffering from one of the listed conditions\\nshould consider discussing supplementation with a\\nhealth care provider.\\nPreparations\\nNatural sources\\nFood products are a good source of CoQ 10, and pro-\\nvide approximately half of the body’s requirement. Cold-\\nwater fish such as mackerel, salmon, sardines, and tuna\\nare particularly high in CoQ10. Vegetable oils and meats\\nalso provide good sources.

Frey, PhD\\nCoix\\nDescription\\nCoix is a plant whose botanical name is Coix lacry-\\nma-jobi. It belongs to the Gramineae (or Poaceae) family.\\nCoix is used in traditional Chinese medicine, where it is\\ncalled yi yi ren. In English it is also known as Job’s tears.\\nCoix is an annual plant that grows wild to a height\\nof about 3 ft (1 m) in sunny but moist grasslands. It is\\nalso cultivated in many parts of the Orient. Coix may\\nhave originated in East Asia, but it is now found through-\\nout East India, China, Japan, the Philippines, northern\\nAfrica, the Caribbean, Central America, northern South\\nAmerica, and the United States. The plant has narrow,\\nribbon-like leaves. The seed with the husk removed is\\nused medicinally. In some areas coix is cultivated as a\\nfood grain. The seeds contain about 52% starch, 18%\\nprotein, and 7% fat, giving them a higher protein-to-car-\\nbohydrate ratio than other cereal grains.\\nGeneral use\\nCoix is used as both a healing herb and a food. The\\nseeds, with the husks removed, are important in tradi-\\ntional Chinese medicine. These are said to have a cool\\nnature and a sweet, bland taste. In traditional Chinese\\nmedicine, coix seed is used to treat internal dampness\\nand damp-heat conditions, especially disorders of the\\nspleen, stomach, lungs, and large intestine.\\nChinese herbalists used coix to improve water flow\\nthrough the body. It is used to promote urination and as a\\ndiuretic to treat edema. It can be used to reduce pain and\\nspasms in the legs when there is also swelling of the\\nlegs. Coix is also used to treat such conditions of the gas-\\ntrointestinal system as diarrhea, poor digestion, and ab-\\ndominal bloating.\\nOther claims are also made for coix seed. It is said that\\na tea made from the boiled seeds will help to cure warts,\\nand that in general coix is good for the skin, helping to\\nnourish and soften it so that it looks smooth and healthy.\\nCoix is often used in formulas that treat arthritis and\\nrheumatism, conditions believed to be caused by excess\\ndampness according to traditional Chinese medicine.\\nChinese herbalists also use it to treat appendicitis, lung\\ndisease, lung abscesses, beriberi, and cancer.\\nThe seeds of coix are said to have anti-inflammato-\\nry, antiseptic, and fever-reducing properties. It is claimed\\nthat they can prevent spasms, lower blood sugar, and act\\nas a sedative. The coix root has been used to treat men-\\nstrual disorders.\\nThere is no doubt that coix also has value as a food\\ngrain, although the seedcoat is hard to remove, making it\\ndifficult to produce flour. Coix can be cooked like barley\\nor rice, however, and the flour can be used to make\\nbread. Parched coix seeds are used to make tea, and a\\ncoffee substitute can be made from the roasted seeds of\\nsome Chinese subspecies.\\nWith so many claims made for coix, scientific inter-\\nest in the plant is quite high. Agricultural scientists are\\ninvestigating the genetics of coix with an eye toward\\ngrowing it as a food crop, and medical researchers are\\nlooking at its healing properties. In 1994, Chinese re-\\nsearchers isolated a compound from coix that had anti-\\ntumor properties. This compound has not been tested\\noutside the laboratory, however. Many other researchers\\nhave investigated the effects of coix on the immune sys-\\ntem cells in test tubes and in laboratory animals. Still\\nother researchers have seen test-tube evidence of anti-\\nviral activity. It is too early to tell whether these labora-\\ntory results will carry over into humans, but given the\\nhigh interest in coix, more studies are being done that\\nwill soon make the findings clearer.\\nPreparations\\nCoix seeds are harvested when the plant ripens in\\nthe autumn. The husks are removed and the seed is used\\neither fresh, boiled, roasted, or fermented. In traditional\\nChinese medicine, a liquor fermented from coix seeds\\nmay be given for rheumatism.

Cold sores are caused by a\\nherpes simplex virus infection.\\nDescription\\nA cold sore is a fluid-filled, painful blister that is\\nusually on or around the lips. Other names for cold sores\\nare fever blisters, oral herpes, labial herpes, herpes labi-\\nalis, and herpes febrilis. Cold sores most often occur on\\nthe lips, distinguishing them from the common canker\\nsore that is usually located inside the mouth. Cold sores\\ndo not usually occur inside the mouth except during the\\ninitial episode. Canker sores usually form either on the\\ntongue or inside the cheeks.\\nCold sores are caused by a herpes virus. There are\\neight different kinds of human herpes viruses. Only two\\nof these, herpes simplex, types 1 and 2, can cause cold\\nsores. It is commonly believed that herpes simplex virus\\ntype 1 infects above the waist and herpes simplex virus\\ntype 2 infects below the waist. This is not completely\\ntrue. Both herpes virus type 1 and type 2 can cause her-\\npes lesions on the lips or genitals but recurrent cold sores\\nare almost always type 1.\\nOral herpes is very common. More than 60% of\\nAmericans have had a cold sore and almost 25% of those\\ninfected experience recurrent outbreaks. Most of these\\npersons became infected before age 10. Anyone can be-\\ncome infected by herpes virus and once infected, the virus\\nremains latent for life. Herpes viruses are spread from per-\\nson to person by direct skin-to-skin contact. The highest\\nrisk for spreading the virus is the time period beginning\\nwith the appearance of blisters and ending with scab for-\\nmation. However, infected persons need not have visible\\nblisters to spread the infection to others since the virus\\nmay be present in the saliva without obvious oral lesions.\\nViruses are different from bacteria. While bacteria\\nare independent and can reproduce on their own, viruses\\nenter human cells and force them to make more virus.\\nThe infected human cell is usually killed and releases\\nthousands of new viruses. The cell death and resulting tis-\\nsue damage causes the actual cold sores. In addition, her-\\npes virus can infect a cell and instead of making the cell\\nmulas such as ginseng and atractylodes formula. When\\ncoix is used for medicinal purposes, the usual daily dose\\nis 10–30 g. Coix can be eaten as nourishment, and in this\\nway is different from other herbs, which are given in\\nlimited doses. Puffed coix, similar to puffed wheat or\\npuffed rice cereals, is sold in health food stores.\\nPrecautions\\nTraditional Chinese herbalists suggest that pregnant\\nwomen not use coix.\\nSide effects\\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, coix has been used\\nwithout any undesirable side effects. There are indica-\\ntions, however, that people who eat large amounts of\\ncoix as food can become dehydrated.\\nInteractions\\nCoix is has been used for thousands of years in con-\\njunction with other herbs with no reported interactions.\\nSince coix is used almost exclusively in Chinese medi-\\ncine, there are no studies of its interactions with Western\\npharmaceuticals.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMolony, David.

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by permis-\\nsion.)\\nIn 95% of patients with cold sores, the blisters occur\\nat the outer edge of the lips which is called the “vermil-\\nion border.” Less often, blisters form on the nose, chin,\\nor cheek. Following the prodrome, the disease process is\\nrapid. First, small red bumps appear which quickly form\\nfluid-filled blisters. The painful blisters may either burst\\nand form a scab or dry up and form a scab. Within two\\ndays of the first red bumps, all the blisters have formed\\nscabs. The skin heals completely and without scarring\\nwithin six to 10 days.\\nSome children have a very serious primary (first\\nepisode) herpes infection called gingivostomatitis. This\\ncauses fever, swollen lymph glands, and numerous blisters\\ninside the mouth and on the lips and tongue, which may\\nform large, open sores. These painful sores may last up to\\nthree weeks and can make eating and drinking difficult. Be-\\ncause of this, young children with gingivostomatitis are at\\nrisk for dehydration (excessive loss of water from the body).\\nMost people experience fewer than two recurrent\\noutbreaks of cold sores each year. Some people never ex-\\nperience outbreaks while others have more frequent oc-\\ncurrences. In most people, the blisters form in the same\\narea each time and are triggered by the same factors\\n(such as stress, sun exposure, etc.).\\nDiagnosis\\nBecause oral herpes is so common, it is diagnosed\\nprimarily by symptoms. It can be diagnosed and treated\\nby the family doctor, dermatologists (doctors who spe-\\ncialize in skin diseases) and infectious disease special-\\nists. Laboratory tests may be performed to look for the\\nvirus. Because healing sores do not shed much virus, a\\nsample from an open sore is taken for viral culture. A\\nsterile cotton swab is wiped over open sores and the\\nsample used to infect human cells in culture. Cells which\\nare killed by herpes virus have a certain appearance\\nunder microscopic examination. The results of this test\\nare available within two to 10 days.\\nOral herpes may resemble a bacterial infection\\ncalled impetigo . This skin infection is most commonly\\nseen in children and causes herpes-like blisters around\\nthe mouth and nose. Also, because oral herpes can occur\\ninside the mouth, the blisters could be mistaken for com-\\nmon canker sores. Therefore, doctors need to determine\\nwhether the blisters are oral herpes, canker sores, or im-\\npetigo. The diagnosis and treatment of herpes infections\\nshould be covered by most insurance providers.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no cure for cold sores but many alternative\\ntreatments can reduce outbreaks and shorten healing\\nproduce new viruses, it hides inside the cell and waits.\\nHerpes virus hides in the nervous system. This is called\\n“latency.” A latent virus can wait inside the nervous sys-\\ntem for days, months, or even years. At some future time,\\nthe virus “awakens” and causes the cell to produce thou-\\nsands of new viruses which causes an active infection.\\nThis process of latency and active infection is best\\nunderstood by considering the cold sore cycle. An active\\ninfection is obvious because cold sores are present. The\\nfirst infection is called the “primary” infection. This ac-\\ntive infection is then controlled by the body’s immune\\nsystem and the sores heal. In between active infections\\nthe virus is latent. At some point in the future, latent\\nviruses become activated and once again cause sores.\\nThese are called “recurrent” infections. Although it is\\nunknown what triggers a latent virus to activate, several\\nconditions seem to bring on infections. These include\\nstress, illness, fatigue, exposure to sunlight, menstrua-\\ntion, fever, and diet.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nWhile anyone can be infected by herpes virus, not\\neveryone will show symptoms. The first symptoms of\\nherpes occur within two to 20 days after contact with an\\ninfected person. Symptoms of the primary infection are\\nusually more severe than those of recurrent infections.\\nThe primary infection can cause symptoms like other\\nviral infections including fatigue,headache, fever, and\\nswollen lymph nodes in the neck.\\nTypically, 50–80% of persons with oral herpes experi-\\nence a prodrome (symptoms of oncoming disease) of pain,\\nburning, itching, or tingling at the site where blisters will\\nform. This prodrome stage may last anywhere from a few\\nhours, to one or two days. The herpes infection prodrome\\noccurs in both the primary infection and recurrent infections.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 506'),\n",

During an outbreak of cold sores, salty foods, citrus\\nfoods (oranges etc.), and other foods that irritate the sores\\nshould be avoided. Wash the sores once or twice a day\\nwith a warm, saline solution and pat gently to dry. Appli-\\ncation of ice or a cold wet teabag for 10 minutes four or\\nfive times a day can relieve the itching and burning.\\nSupplements\\nVitamin and mineral supplements and diet may have\\nan effect on the recurrence and duration of cold sores. In\\ngeneral, cold sore sufferers should eat a healthy diet of\\nunprocessed foods such as vegetables, fruits, and whole\\ngrains. Alcohol,caffeine , chocolate, nuts, and sugar\\nshould be avoided.\\nAn imbalance in the amino acids lysine and argi-\\nnine is thought to be a contributing factor in herpes virus\\noutbreaks. A diet that is rich in the amino acid lysine\\nmay help prevent recurrences of cold sores. Foods that\\ncontain high levels of lysine include most vegetables,\\nlegumes, fish, turkey, and chicken. In one study, patients\\ntaking lysine supplements had milder symptoms during\\nan outbreak, a shorter healing time, and had fewer out-\\nbreaks than patients who did not take lysine. Patients\\nshould take 1,000 mg of lysine three times a day during a\\ncold sore outbreak and 500 mg daily on an ongoing basis\\nto prevent recurrences. The effectiveness of lysine sup-\\nplementation in treating herpes infections is controver-\\nsial. Intake of the amino acid arginine should be reduced.\\nFoods rich in arginine that should be avoided are choco-\\nlate, peanuts, almonds, and other nuts and seeds.\\nVitamin C and bioflavonoids (a substance in fruits\\nthat helps the body to absorb and use vitamin C) have\\nbeen shown to reduce the duration of a cold sore out-\\nbreak and reduce the number of sores. The vitamin B\\ncomplex includes important vitamins that support the\\nnervous system where herpes viruses are dormant. B\\ncomplex vitamins also can help manage stress, an impor-\\ntant contributing factor to the outbreak of herpes viruses.\\nSome studies have shown that correcting iron, folate, vi-\\ntamin C, or vitamin B 12 deficiencies improves cold\\nsores. Vitamin E speeds healing and reduces pain.\\nSqueeze the oil from a vitamin E capsule onto a cotton\\nball and apply to the sore for 30 minutes to one hour.\\nHerbals\\nMints are effective antivirals. Lemon balm or\\nMelissa (Melissa officinalis) is comparable to the antivi-\\nral acyclovir in the treatment of cold sores. Apply lemon\\nbalm cream to the sore several times a day. Alternatively,\\nprepare lemon balm tea, drink the tea and apply the\\ndregs to the sore for one or two hours. The patient may\\nalso drink several strong cups of teas prepared from hys-\\nsop, oregano, rosemary, thyme, and sage. Licorice may\\nbe added to the tea.\\nLicorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) is an antiviral and im-\\nmune system stimulant. Licorice is available as a capsule\\nor an ointment. Gradually take up to 300 mg a day. Apply\\nointment that contains glycyrrhetinic or glycyrrhizic acid\\ndirectly to the sore as necessary. Ingestion of licorice may\\ncause loose stools and high blood pressure.\\nChinese medicine\\nTreatment with Qing Dai San (Natural Indigo Pow-\\nder) mixed with cold boiled water and applied to the sore\\nis generally all that is needed. For recurrent cold sores,\\nthe following oral preparations can be taken:\\n• Yin Huang Kou Fu Yi (Honeysuckle and Scutellaria\\nFluid): one ampule three times daily\\n• Yin Qiao Jie Du Pian (Honeysuckle and Forsythia\\nTablet to Resolve Toxin): two to four tablets three times\\ndaily\\n• Huang Lian Shang Qing Wan (Coptis Pill to Clear\\nHeat of Upper Jiao): 5 g, two to three times daily\\nOther treatments for cold sores include:\\n• Pepto-Bismol. Rub liquid into cold sore.\\n• Laser therapy. Ten daily treatments with low-intensity\\nlaser significantly lowered the incidence of oral herpes\\noutbreaks as compared to placebo.\\n• Mild electric current. Preliminary studies of a small de-\\nvice that delivers a mild electric current to the cold sore\\nsite have shown shorter duration of pain and blisters.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThere is no cure for herpes virus infections. There\\nare antiviral drugs available which have some effect in\\nlessening the symptoms and decreasing the length of her-\\npes outbreaks. There is evidence that some may also pre-\\nvent future outbreaks. These antiviral drugs are most ef-\\nfective when taken as early in the infection process as\\npossible. For the best results, drug treatment should begin\\nduring the prodrome stage before blisters are visible.\\nAcyclovir (Zovirax) has been the drug of choice for\\nherpes infection and can be given intravenously or taken\\nby mouth. It can be applied directly to sores as an oint-\\nment but is not very useful in this form. A liquid form for\\nchildren is also available. Acyclovir is effective in treat-\\ning both the primary infection and recurrent outbreaks.\\nWhen taken by mouth to prevent an outbreak, acyclovir\\nreduces the frequency of herpes outbreaks. In 2001, a re-\\nport showed that use of high-dose acyclovir during pri-\\nmary infection will reduce the extent of latent infection.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 507\\nCold sore\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 507'),\n",

The spread\\nof herpes virus to the eyes is very serious. Herpes virus\\ncan infect the cells in the cornea and cause scarring that\\nmay impair vision.\\nPrevention\\nThe only way to prevent oral herpes is to avoid con-\\ntact with infected persons. This is not an easy solution\\nbecause many people are not aware that they are infected\\nand can easily infect others. As of 2001 there were no\\nknown herpes vaccines available, although vaccines are\\nbeing tested.\\nSeveral practices can reduce the occurrence of cold\\nsores and the spread of virus to other body locations or\\npeople. These practices are:\\n• Avoidance of sun exposure to the face. Before getting\\nprolonged exposure to the sun, apply sunscreen to the\\nface and especially to the lips. Wearing a hat with a\\nlarge brim is also helpful.\\n• Avoid touching cold sores. Squeezing, picking, or\\npinching blisters can allow the virus to spread to other\\nparts of the lips or face and infect those sites.\\n• Wash hands frequently. Persons with oral herpes should\\nwash their hands carefully before touching others. An\\ninfected person can spread the virus to others even\\nwhen he or she has no obvious blisters.\\n• Avoid contact with others during active infection. In-\\nfected persons should avoid kissing or sexual contact\\nwith others until after the cold sores have healed.\\n• Wear gloves when applying ointment to a child’s sore.\\n• Be especially careful with infants. Never kiss the eyes\\nor lips of a baby who is under six months old.\\n• Be watchful of infected children. Do not allow infected\\nchildren to share toys that may be put into the mouth.\\nToys that have been mouthed should be disinfected be-\\nfore other children play with them.\\n• Maintain good general health. A healthy diet, plenty of\\nsleep, and exercise help to minimize the chance of get-\\nting a cold or the flu, which are known to bring on cold\\nsores. Also, good general health keeps the immune sys-\\ntem strong which helps to keep the virus in check and\\nprevent outbreaks.\\n• Participate in a stress reduction program. Yoga, mas-\\nsage, aromatherapy, meditation, hypnosis, or biofeed-\\nback can relieve stress which may reduce outbreaks.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGorbach, Sherman, John Bartlett, and Neil Blacklow, eds.

Odle\\nColeus\\nDescription\\nColeus forskohlii is a perennial plant, with a strong,\\ncamphor-like odor. It is in the mint family. It grows well\\nin warm temperate or subtropical areas. The plant is na-\\ntive to areas of India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.\\nColeus has long been used in traditional Indian\\n(Ayurvedic) medicine, but gained popularity when a\\nchemical extract of the root called forskolin demonstrat-\\ned properties that make it a potential treatment for asth-\\nma, bronchitis, glaucoma, congestive heart failure, and\\nother conditions. Forskolin was first identified by West-\\nern researchers in the 1970s, but the effects of the whole\\ncoleus plant and its extracts have not been as well stud-\\nied or understood.\\nAnother species of coleus, Coleus kilimandschari,i s\\nfound in parts of Africa and has been used in Rwandan\\nfolk medicine to treat infections and autoimmune dis-\\neases. Recent studies of Rwandan coleus indicate that it\\nis effective against a variety of disorders involving de-\\nstruction of red blood cells. As of 2002, however, Rwan-\\ndan coleus has not been studied as intensively as Coleus\\nforskohlii, and its extracts await further analysis.\\nChinese research indicates that several diterpenoids\\nfound in the leaves and stems of coleus may be effective\\nagainst leukemia cells. These recently discovered com-\\npounds, however, require further study and analysis.\\nGeneral use\\nForskolin increases the levels of a cell-regulating\\ncompound called cyclic adenosine monophosphate\\n(cAMP). This property allows it to stabilize mast cells,\\nwhich contain histamine and other inflammatory sub-\\nstances. Preventing the release of these compounds could\\nmake forskolin valuable in the treatment of diseases with\\nan allergic component, such as asthma and eczema.\\nAnother benefit of the increase of cAMP is forsko-\\nlin’s ability to relax smooth muscles. The bronchioles,\\nuterus, arteries, gastrointestinal tract, and bladder all\\ncontain smooth muscle that is responsive to the antispas-\\nmodic effects of forskolin. As an antispasmodic, it has\\npotential applications for conditions that involve cramp-\\ning or smooth muscle contraction. These include asthma,\\npainful periods,angina, irritable bowel syndrome ,\\nbladder infections, and high blood pressure.\\nPeople suffering from asthma may benefit from the\\nuse of forskolin in its capacity as an antispasmodic. Dur-\\ning an asthma attack, the smooth muscle within small\\npassageways of the lungs (bronchioles) constricts and\\nmakes breathing difficult. The action of forskolin is simi-\\nlar to that of some standard inhalers containing such\\nmedications as albuterol, a beta agonist bronchodilator.\\nBoth substances relax the smooth muscle, and improve\\nthe person’s breathing ability. Studies of forskolin for the\\ntreatment of asthma have shown positive results in both\\noral and inhaled preparations, although it is not commer-\\ncially available in an inhaled formula at this time. Other\\nallergic conditions, including eczema, may also respond\\nwell to forskolin. Levels of cAMP are reduced in the\\nbronchioles and skin of people suffering from asthma\\nand eczema. The lack of cAMP causes histamine release\\nand subsequent allergic symptoms, including bron-\\nchoconstriction and local reaction. Forskolin may be\\nable to prevent the onset of symptoms in susceptible\\npeople by increasing cAMP levels. It can theoretically be\\nhelpful for any condition that is caused, wholly or par-\\ntially, by an allergic reaction. Professional help should\\nbe sought to use forskolin for this indication, particularly\\nbecause of potential interactions with other medications\\nused for asthma.\\nPsoriasis can be treated by taking forskolin supple-\\nments. In this condition, skin cells multiply at a rate\\nmuch greater than normal. Itchy, silvery patches are\\nformed on the skin. This may be due to an imbalance of\\ncell regulating chemicals, including cAMP, that can be\\nnormalized by forskolin.\\nCardiovascular diseases, such as congestive heart\\nfailure, angina, and high blood pressure, have the poten-\\ntial to be treated by forskolin. The extract appears to in-\\ncrease the contractility of the heart, and relax the smooth\\nmuscles in the walls of the arteries. The relaxation of\\nthe arteries decreases blood pressure, pain due to angina,\\nand strain on the heart. Maximum benefit may be\\nachieved in conjunction with other botanicals or medica-\\ntions, such as dobutamine.\\nBlood vessels in the brain are dilated by forskolin,\\nwhich could have clinical applications for patients who\\nare at risk of, or recovering from,stroke. Forskolin also\\ndecreases the risk of abnormal clotting.

Use the opposite hand to pat the\\ninfant’s back while rocking back and forth.(Illustration by\\nElectronic Illustrators Group. The Gale Group.)\\nColic\\nDefinition\\nColic is persistent, unexplained crying and discom-\\nfort in an otherwise healthy baby between the ages of\\ntwo weeks and about five months.\\nDescription\\nColic affects 10-20% of all infants. It is more com-\\nmon in boys than in girls and most common in a family’s\\nfirst child. Symptoms of colic usually appear when a\\nbaby is 14-21 days old, reach a peak at the age of three\\nmonths, and disappear within the next eight weeks.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nSome babies who have colic are simply fussy. Oth-\\ners cry so hard that their faces turn red, then pale.\\nEpisodes may occur frequently but intermittently, usual-\\nly beginning with prolonged periods of crying in the late\\nafternoon or evening. Crying may intensify, taper off,\\nand then get even louder. It can last for just a few min-\\nutes or continue for several hours. During a colicky\\nepisode, babies’ bellies often look swollen, feel hard, and\\nmake a rumbling sound. Many babies grow rigid, clench\\ntheir fists, curl their toes, and draw their legs toward their\\nbody. A burp or a bowel movement can end an attack.\\nMost babies who have colic do not seem to be in pain\\nbetween attacks.\\nOne cause of colic may be the swallowing of large\\namounts of air, especially during feeding time. Air may\\nthen become trapped in the digestive tract and cause dis-\\ncomfort. Other possible causes include:\\n• immaturity of the digestive system\\n• food intolerances\\n• too little or too much food\\n• lack of sleep\\n• loneliness\\n• overheated formula\\n• overstimulation resulting from too much noise, light, or\\nactivity\\n• stress and tension on the part of the mother and other\\ncaregivers\\n• foods the mother eats, if breast-feeding, which are al-\\nlergens or irritants for the baby\\nDiagnosis\\nColic is suspected in an infant who:\\n• has cried loudly for at least three hours a day at least\\nthree times a week for three weeks or longer\\n• is not hungry but cries for several hours between din-\\nnertime and midnight\\n• demonstrates the clenched fists, rigidity, and other\\nphysical traits associated with colic\\nThe baby’s medical history and a parent’s descrip-\\ntion of eating, sleeping, and crying patterns are used to\\nconfirm the diagnosis of colic. Physical examination and\\nlaboratory tests are used to rule out infection, intestinal\\nblockage, and other conditions that can cause abdominal\\npain and other colic symptoms.\\nTreatment\\nParents should consult their healthcare practitioner\\nbefore giving any herbal or allopathic medications to\\nvery young children. Teas made with chamomile (Ma-\\ntricaria recutita), lemon balm (Melissa officinalis), pep-\\npermint (Mentha piperita ), catnip (Nepeta cataria ), or\\ndill (Anethum graveolens ) can lessen bowel inflamma-\\ntion and reduce gas. Slippery elm powder (Ulmus fulva)\\nis soothing and healing for the digestive system. Homeo-\\npathic remedies that may be effective for colic include\\nBryonia30c every five minutes as needed, and\\nChamomilla 6c every five minutes for up to an hour.

This will\\nhelp to calm the situation.\\nHands-on treatments are often helpful in treating\\ncolic. Squeezing the acupressurepoint at the webbing be-\\ntween the thumb and index finger of either hand can calm\\na crying child. Gently massaging the abdomen with a cir-\\ncular motion can also be used. Applying warm compress-\\nes over the child’s abdomen can also relieve cramping.\\nSoothing movements may help to calm the baby.\\nColicky babies cry less when they are soothed by the\\nmotion of a swing, a car ride, or being carried in a par-\\nent’s arms. Taking the infant for a walk may also help\\nwith soothing and encouraging sleep. Rocking the baby\\nin a quiet, darkened room can be used to reduce over-\\nstimulation, as well.\\nGiving small, frequent feedings rather than a few\\nlarge feedings will be easier on digestion for a bottle-fed\\nbaby. For those who breastfeed, food allergens can be\\ntransmitted through the milk of the mother. Therefore,\\nfoods that cause problems in the infant should be re-\\nmoved from the mother’s diet. These are most often like-\\nly to be coffee, tea, chocolate, citrus fruit, peanuts,\\nwheat, and vegetables belonging to the cabbage family,\\nincluding broccoli.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nMedications do not cure colic. Doctors sometimes\\nrecommend simethicone (Mylicon drops) to relieve gas\\npain. Generally, parents are advised to take a practical\\napproach, using home remedies. However, a doctor\\nshould be notified if a baby with colic:\\n• develops a rectal fever higher than 101°F (38.3°C)\\n• cries for more than four hours without relief\\n• vomits\\n• has diarrhea or stools that are black or bloody\\n• continually loses weight\\n• continually eats less than normal\\nExpected results\\nColic is distressing, but it is not dangerous. Symp-\\ntoms almost always disappear before a child is six\\nmonths old.\\nPrevention\\nTo help prevent air from being swallowed during\\nfeedings, the infant’s back can be gently massaged to re-\\nlease trapped gas bubbles. Keeping the infant in a sitting\\nposition while feeding is also helpful. Bottle-fed babies\\ncan swallow air if the nipple holes in the bottle are either\\ntoo large or too small. This can be checked by filling the\\nbottle with formula, turning it upside down, and counting\\nthe number of drops released as the bottle is being shaken\\nor squeezed. The hole should allow the release of formula\\nat the rate of one drop per second. In addition, sometimes\\na different style of nipple may improve nursing. A phar-\\nmacy should be consulted for additional guidance.\\nCow’s milk can often be disruptive to an infant’s di-\\ngestion. When cow’s milk is the source of the symptoms,\\nbottle-fed babies should be switched to a soy protein\\nformula. (Regular soymilk should not be used, as it is not\\nformulated for the nutritional needs of a nursing infant.)\\nGoat’s milk is easier to digest than cow’s milk, and is\\nalso an acceptable substitute. Alternately, a tablespoon of\\nacidophilusliquid or powder can be added to eight\\nounces of the infant’s formula. A tablespoon of yogurt\\ncan also be used for this purpose. If an intolerance to\\ncow’s milk is suspected in a breastfed infant, the mother\\nshould eliminate dairy products from her diet, gradually\\nreintroduce after seven days, and monitor the baby’s\\nsymptoms. This should be done with any suspected aller-\\ngen or irritating foods.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nEditors of Time Life Books.

Historically, coins or other items made of silver\\nwere used to help keep water from becoming contami-\\nnated and to keep milk fresh for longer periods when re-\\nfrigeration was not available. This method may still be\\nused today in some remote areas of the world. Silver is\\nalso impregnated into some water filtration systems used\\nboth for swimming pools and for drinking water.\\nDespite the proven antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-\\nfungal properties of silver in vitro, it is unclear whether\\nit can exert the same effects when taken into the body.\\nPart of the issue is what concentration of silver reaches\\nthe area where the infection is occurring before being\\nbound, disseminated, or excreted. Another question is\\nwhether the ingested silver would have an adequate time\\nof contact with the target organisms to produce the de-\\nsired effect. It has a greater chance of benefiting a patient\\nwith local and topical infections.\\nColloidal silver products are often touted as the an-\\nswer to the problem of microbial resistance to antibi-\\notics. While it is certainly true that antibiotics are\\noverused, leading to more bacteria becoming resistant,\\nsubstantive evidence that colloidal silver is a safe and ef-\\nfective replacement does not yet exist.\\nGeneral use\\nSilver is already used in some compounds that are in\\ncommon use against infections. Silvadine is a frequently\\nused agent to prevent infection in burn patients. Silver\\nnitrate was used in the eyes of newborns for years to pre-\\nvent blindness caused by contracting gonorrhea, a sexu-\\nally transmitted disease (STD), during the passage\\nthrough the birth canal. The medication was not, howev-\\ner, effective against chlamydia, another STD that causes\\nneonatal conjunctivitis . Silver nitrate can also be very\\nirritating to the tissues of the eye. Erythromycin and\\ntetracycline are now more frequently used in the United\\nStates for neonatal prophylaxis.\\nThe claims made for colloidal silver are innumerable.\\nSilver has been said to be effective against hundreds of\\nstrains of bacteria, and to be supportive in the treatment of\\ncolds and flu,hepatitis, Epstein-Barr virus, pneumonia,\\nbronchitis, and yeast infections. It has also been recom-\\nmended for topical use in the mouth, eyes, ears, nose, si-\\nnuses, and for a wide variety of skin conditions. It is diffi-\\ncult to determine which of the claims, if any of them, have\\nmerit because substantive research data are lacking. Most\\nof the reported effects are based on in vitro or anecdotal\\nevidence. Extrapolations from such testimonials would be\\nchallenging due to the variability in particle size, concen-\\ntration, quality of the preparation, and total dose.\\nPreparations\\nSilver colloid has been created by grinding, wave\\nmethod (such as ultrasonic), liquid, chemical, or electri-\\ncal modes of manufacture. They vary in how large the\\nparticles of silver are that are produced, and whether\\nthey carry an electrical charge. Particles that are very\\nsmall and charged repel each other enough that they tend\\nto remain in a suspended state for a longer time rather\\nthan settling. Currently, the electrocolloidal process is\\nthe most used, and considered to be the best at creating\\nvery small, charged particles.\\nColloidal silver may be purchased ready for use, but\\nproducts have been found to be inconsistent in content,\\nvarying from 15–120% of the silver concentration they\\nare labeled to contain. Commercially produced products\\nvary greatly in particle size, potency, stability, and con-\\ntents. Some contain stabilizers or trace elements in addi-\\ntion to silver, which are considered undesirable. Others\\nhave been found to have bacterial contaminants.\\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at one\\ntime considered it a medication, exempted from the stan-\\ndard regulations as a result of being used and marketed\\nprior to 1938. Since that time, the exemption has been\\nrevoked. In the United States, silver is now considered a\\ndietary supplement as opposed to an over-the-counter\\nmedication. As such, specific claims to benefit or treat\\nmedical conditions can not be made.\\nAs an alternative to manufactured colloidal silver\\nproducts, assorted kits are available for the individual to\\nmake colloidal silver for personal use. These kits gener-\\nally use an electrical current to disperse particulate silver\\ninto the carrier. Important factors for producing colloidal\\nsilver at home are the purity of the silver, the purity of\\nthe water, and proper timing to form the desired concen-\\ntration. Stability of the colloid is variable, and the silver\\nwill tend to gradually settle as the charge on the particles\\ndissipates.\\nPrecautions\\nThe deposition of silver under the skin can cause a\\ncondition called argyria. This condition is not common,\\nbut the skin of those who are affected is permanently\\nstained a blue or gray color. The type of silver com-\\npound, length of treatment, concentration, and total dose\\nrequired to cause argyria is a matter of some debate.\\nThere seems to be a great individual variation in suscep-\\ntibility. Proponents claim that the true colloidal form of\\nsilver cannot cause the condition, but for safety purpos-\\nes, all silver consumed should be considered a potential\\ncontributor to argyria.

It is the process of cleansing the colon by pass-\\ning several gallons of water through it with the use of\\nspecial equipment. It is similar to an enema but treats the\\nwhole colon, not just the lower bowel. This has the effect\\nof flushing out impacted fecal matter, toxins, mucous,\\nand even parasites, which often build up over the passage\\nof time. It is a procedure that should only be undertaken\\nby a qualified practitioner.\\nOrigins\\nCleansing the colon with the use of hydrotherapy is\\nnot a new concept. Forms of colonic irrigation have been\\nused successfully for decades to relieve chronic toxicity\\nand even acute cases of toxemia.\\nBenefits\\nAnyone suffering from gas, bloating, cramping\\npains, acne and other skin complaints, arthritis, and a list\\nof bowel complaints such as diverticulitis and irritable\\nbowel etc., may benefit from colonic irrigation. In partic-\\nular,cancer patients are often advised to undertake a\\ncourse of colonic irrigation sessions as an essential part\\nof their treatment. When a biological cancer therapy be-\\ngins to enable the body to breakdown a cancerous mass,\\nit is essential that speedy and effective elimination of the\\nresulting toxins is achieved.\\nColon and bowel cancer remain among the leading\\ncauses of death in the United States, and alternative practi-\\ntioners suggest that it can be prevented by efficient hygiene\\nprocedures. Providing that care is taken to replace the nat-\\nural organisms that flourish in the bowel, many health ben-\\nefits can be expected from colonic irrigation. In general, al-\\nternative practitioners maintain that an ill-functioning\\nbowel is the source of all disease, and therefore keeping it\\nclean will be an effective protection against disease.\\nRemoving large amounts of toxic matter relieves the\\npatient and can lead to the alleviation of symptoms such\\nas arthritis,chronic fatigue syndrome, candidiasis, and a\\nhost of other illnesses. Properly executed, colonic irriga-\\ntion can help restore normal peristaltic action to a slug-\\ngish bowel, thus reducing the need for more hydrotherapy\\ntreatments over time. In addition, removing the layer of\\nfecal matter which coats the intestines in many individu-\\nals allows improved assimilation of the nutrients from\\nfoods and can alleviate symptoms of vitamin and other\\nnutrient deficiencies. Many alternative health practition-\\ners consider some form of hydrotherapy for the bowel to\\nbe essential in the treatment of degenerative diseases.\\nDescription\\nOver time, many people develop a thick layer of\\nfecal matter that coats their colon.

It is quite common\\nfor people to only have one bowel movement per day,\\nsome as few as one or two per week.\\nAlternative practitioners advise that we probably\\nshould have one bowel movement for every meal that we\\neat. If not, then we are not eliminating wastes complete-\\nly, and if input exceeds output, then we will surely suffer\\nthe consequences at some point.\\nIncomplete elimination of body wastes may result in\\nthe following, depending on where the deposits end up:\\n• sluggish system\\n• joint pain and arthritis\\n• irritable bowel syndrome\\n• diverticulitis\\n• Crohn’s disease\\n• leaky gut syndrome\\n• heart problem\\n• migraine\\n• allergies\\n• bad breath\\n• acne and other skin problems such as psoriasis\\n• asthma\\n• early senility and Alzheimer’s disease\\n• chronic fatigue syndrome\\n• cancer, particularly of the bowel\\n• multiple sclerosis\\nDuring colonic irrigation, a small speculum is\\npassed into the patient’s bowel through the rectum. This\\nis attached to a tube, which leads to a machine that\\npumps temperature-controlled water into the colon at a\\ncontrolled rate (to be controlled by either the practitioner\\nor the patient). The temperature of the water should ide-\\nally be kept as close to body temperature as possible.\\nThe patient will temporarily be filled with water up\\nto the level of the entire colon. Patients say they can feel\\nthe water up under their ribs but that the process, al-\\nthough sometimes uncomfortable, is not painful. The\\namount of water will vary but will generally be in the re-\\ngion of between two and six liters (or quarts) at any one\\ntime. This triggers peristaltic action and the patient will\\nbegin to expel the water along with fecal matter back\\nthrough the tube and into the machine.\\nThe fecal matter is flushed out through a viewing\\ntube, so that what is eliminated may be monitored. Quite\\noften, unsuspected parasites are expelled, along with\\nvery old fecal material, very dark in color, which may\\nhave been in the colon for years. Some therapists com-\\nment that it looks like aging rubber.\\nDuring the treatment, the therapist will gently mas-\\nsage the patient’s abdomen to help dislodge impacted\\nfecal matter. In addition to massage, sometimes acu-\\npressure, reflexology , or lymphatic drainage tech-\\nniques may be used to loosen deposits and stimulate the\\nbowel. It is important that the right amount of water is\\nused, as too much will cause discomfort and too little\\nwill be ineffective. If correctly done, colonic irrigation is\\nnot painful at all and some patients claim to sleep\\nthrough their treatment.\\nSanitation is vital to this process. The tubes and\\nspeculums used are generally disposable, but other parts\\nof the machine, such as the viewing tube, must be steril-\\nized after each patient.\\nNormally, a series of treatments will be required to\\nachieve desired results regarding the elimination of im-\\npacted, decaying matter, and restoration of bowel regu-\\nlarity. Initially only gas and recent fecal matter may be\\nexpelled. The residue attached to the colon wall is usual-\\nly the result of years of neglect, and therapists say that\\none cannot expect complete relief in only one session.\\nImpacted fecal matter can cause an imbalance of the\\nnatural organisms that normally populate the bowel,\\ncausing what is known as dysbiosis. Under ideal condi-\\ntions, the bowel is populated by a variety of naturally oc-\\ncurring organisms. It seems that the enzymes occurring\\nin fresh fruit and vegetables encourage these beneficial\\norganisms. One of the results of eating processed dena-\\ntured foods is that this natural balance is upset, and food\\nmay begin to rot in the bowel instead of being processed.\\nDecomposing matter can cause a toxic condition\\nand may lead to many health problems, as constipation\\ncauses backed up pollution of the body cells. The\\nprocess of repair and elimination of wastes enters a\\ndownward spiral which at best will cause fatigue, lack of\\nenergy and premature aging, and at worst can cause de-\\ngenerative diseases, among them allergies, and even can-\\ncer and Alzheimer’s disease.\\nThe cost of colonic irrigation treatments varies, but is\\ngenerally between $35-70 per session, which may last\\nfrom 45 minutes to one hour. The cost of the machine itself\\nranges from $4,000-12,000, but again, it should be noted\\nthat only qualified therapists should conduct sessions.\\nPreparations\\nMost practitioners prefer that distilled or purified\\nwater is used for colonic irrigation, but others use steril-\\nized tap water.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 515\\nColonic irrigation\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 515'),\n",

It is the second most common\\ncause of cancer-related death in the United States, and is\\ndiagnosed in more than 130,000 new patients annually.\\nDescription\\nColorectal cancer occurs in either the last 6 ft (1.8\\nm) of intestine, known as the large bowel or colon,\\nand/or in the rectum, where the colon terminates and\\nwaste (feces) leaves the body. The majority of malignan-\\ncies that occur in colorectal cancers are called adenocar-\\ncinomas. When an individual develops colorectal adeno-\\ncarcinomas, malignant cancer cells grow inside the colon\\nand/or the rectum. Large clusters of these cells form\\nstructures known as tumors.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCauses & risk factors\\nThe exact cause of colorectal cancer is unknown.\\nHowever, there are a number of known risk factors that\\nincrease the odds for developing the disease. They in-\\nclude:\\n• Family history. Individuals who have one or more close\\nrelatives that were diagnosed with colorectal cancer\\nmay be at increased risk for the disease. In 2003, re-\\nsearch showed that about 5% of colorectal cancer pa-\\ntients had inherited syndromes.\\n• History of bowel disease and/or colon polyps.

They may develop into malignancies later in life.\\nColon diseases that cause inflammation and irritation\\nof the bowel, such as Crohn’s disease and inflamma-\\ntory bowel disease , also can increase an individual’s\\nrisk of developing a colorectal malignancy.\\n• Obesity. Overweight individuals, especially those with\\nan apple-shaped body type (where fat is concentrated\\naround the waist) as opposed to a pear-shaped body\\n(where fat is stored in the hips and thighs), are at an in-\\ncreased risk for colorectal cancer. A high fat diet also\\nincreases an individual’s chance of developing colorec-\\ntal cancer.\\n• Age. Individuals over age 50 are at an increased risk\\nfor colorectal cancer.\\n• Sedentary lifestyle. A moderate exercise program is\\nthought to have a preventive effect against cancer.\\n• Night work. A 2003 study showed that working the\\nnight shift actually may increase risk of colorectal can-\\ncer in women. Exposure to light at night suppresses the\\nbody’s natural production of melatonin, a hormone that\\nhelps keep certain intestinal cancers from proliferating.\\nSymptoms\\nSymptoms of colorectal cancer include:\\n• blood on the rectum or in the stool\\n• feelings of fecal urgency (feeling as if one has to have a\\nbowel movement all the time)\\n• stomach and/or abdominal pain\\n• changes in bowel habits, including constipation, diar-\\nrhea, and/or pencil-thin stools\\n• extreme fatigue\\n• decreased appetite\\nDiagnosis\\nThe simplest screening tests for colorectal cancer in-\\nclude a digital rectal exam and a fecal occult blood test\\n(FOBT). In the digital rectal exam, a physician inserts a\\ngloved finger into the rectum and feels for any irregulari-\\nties. In the FOBT, stool samples are tested for traces of\\nblood. The test can be done at home and sent to a lab for\\nanalysis. FOBT can reduce the death rate by about 33%.\\nUnfortunately, in the United States, over the past six years\\nless than 35% of the population had received a FOBT.\\nA flexible sigmoidoscopy and/or a colonoscopy may\\nbe performed to view the interior of the colon. The for-\\nmer examines the rectum and lower colon for cancer, and\\nthe latter examines the full length of the colon. During\\nthese procedures, a doctor passes a flexible tube with a\\ntiny, fiber-optic camera device (an endoscope) through\\nthe rectum and into the colon. The doctor can carefully\\nexamine the lining of the intestine for signs of cancer. A\\ntissue sample (a biopsy) of the colon also can be taken\\nthrough the endoscope to examine under a microscope\\nfor evidence of malignancy. Both tests can cause discom-\\nfort, and may be done under a local anesthetic if desired.\\nA lower GI (gastrointestinal) x-ray series can be\\nhelpful in determining how much of the intestine is in-\\nvolved in the disease. A chalky solution called barium,\\nwhich acts as a contrast agent to illuminate the gastroin-\\ntestinal tract on x-ray film, is administered in enema\\nform to the patient. In some cases, air also is pumped\\ninto the rectum to provide a clearer view of the large in-\\ntestine. This is called a double-contrast barium enema.\\nThe pressure in the patient’s abdomen from the air and\\nbarium contrast likely will cause some discomfort.\\nAfter colorectal cancer is diagnosed, further testing\\nis required to determine how far the cancer has spread.\\nThis procedure is known as staging. There are five dif-\\nferent stages of colorectal cancer:\\n• Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ). This is the earliest stage of\\ncolorectal cancer, and indicates that cancerous cells\\nhave not spread beyond the colon lining.\\n• Stage I. The cancer has spread to the second and third\\nlayers of the inside wall of the colon, but is still con-\\ntained within the colon.\\n• Stage II. The cancer has spread beyond the colon, but\\nhas not spread to the lymph nodes.\\n• Stage III. The cancer has spread to a nearby lymph\\nnode, but has not spread throughout the body.\\n• Stage IV .

Colorectal cancer is a life-threat-\\nening disease, and a correct diagnosis and appropriate\\ntreatment with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation is\\ncritical to controlling the illness.\\nAcupuncture and guided imagery may be useful\\ntools in treating pain symptoms and improving immune\\nfunction associated with colorectal cancer. Acupuncture\\ninvolves the placement of a series of thin needles into the\\nskin at targeted locations on the body, known as acu-\\npoints, in order to harmonize the energy flow within the\\nhuman body.\\nGuided imagery involves creating a visual mental\\nimage of pain as a means of relaxation. Once the pain can\\nbe visualized, the patient can adjust the image to make it\\nmore pleasing, and thus more manageable, to them.\\nMovement therapies, such as yoga, t’ai chi , and\\nqigong can aid the recovering patient. They may lessen\\npain symptoms, and help the person to relax and reduce\\nstress.\\nA number of herbal remedies also are available to\\nlessen pain symptoms and promote relaxation and heal-\\ning. However, cancer patients should consult with their\\nhealthcare professional before taking them. Depending\\non the preparation and the type of herb, these remedies\\nmay interact with or enhance the effects of other pre-\\nscribed medications. Herbs that promote healing of the\\ndigestive tract include slippery elm bark (Ulmus rubra),\\nmarsh mallow root (Althaea officinalis), and goldenseal\\n(Hydrastis canadensis).\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment options include surgery, chemotherapy,\\nand radiation. Colorectal cancer is treated in two ways,\\nlocally to eliminate tumor cells from the colon by\\nsurgery and radiation, and to systemically destroy cancer\\ncells that have traveled to other parts of the body. Sys-\\ntemic therapy includes the use of chemotherapy drugs.\\nSurgery\\nThe extent of surgery depends on the type of colorec-\\ntal cancer, whether the disease has spread, and the pa-\\ntient’s age and health. A surgical procedure known as a\\nbowel resection is performed for colon cancers, where the\\nlength of colon containing the cancerous cells is removed,\\nalong with nearby tissues and lymph nodes. The two ends\\nof the remaining colon are then sewn back together.\\nFor cancer affecting the rectum, several other surgi-\\ncal methods may be employed, including local excision\\nof the cancer (where cancerous cells and nearby tissues\\nare cut out of the rectum) and transanal resection, where\\ninvasive cancerous tissue is removed along with normal\\nanal tissue.\\nDepending on the stage of the cancer and the degree\\nof surgery required, some patients may need to get a\\ncolostomy. A colostomy involves surgically attaching the\\nbowel to an opening in the abdominal wall where waste\\nis eliminated into an attached bag.\\nThe presence of cancer cells in the lymph nodes\\nmay require more extensive surgery. If the cancer has\\nspread to the nodes, the patient will need either radiation,\\nchemotherapy, hormone therapy, or a combination of all\\nthree after surgery. This is called “adjuvant therapy.”\\nRadiation\\nOnce the cancer has been removed, the doctor may\\nrecommend radiation treatment to destroy any remaining\\ncancer cells. In cases where the cancer is located in hard\\nto reach areas, radiation may be used to shrink the cancer\\ngrowth or tumor. Radiation stops the cancer cells from di-\\nviding. It works especially well on fast-growing tumors.\\nUnfortunately, it also stops some types of healthy cells\\nfrom dividing. Healthy cells that divide quickly, like those\\nof the skin and hair, are affected the most. This is why ra-\\ndiation can cause fatigue, skin problems, and hair loss.\\nRadiation therapy can be internal, where particles of\\nradioactive materials are implanted into a tumor, or ex-\\nternal, where energy rays (radiation) are directed at the\\ncancer from outside the body. External radiation, the\\nmost common type of treatment for colorectal cancer, is\\nusually administered five days a week for several weeks.\\nRecent studies indicate that radiation therapy decreases\\nthe likelihood of local recurrence of colorectal cancer by\\na significant margin. Some clinicians argue that the ther-\\napy is most effective when given before surgery rather\\nthan after. No definitive clinical trials proved the most\\neffective timing as of late 2001.\\nChemotherapy\\nColorectal cancer surgery may be followed by\\nchemotherapy in even the earliest stages. Chemotherapy\\nis administered either orally or by injection into a blood\\nvessel. It is usually given in cycles, followed by a period\\nof time for recovery, followed by another course of\\ndrugs. Treatment time may range between four and nine\\nmonths.

Odle\\nColor therapy\\nDefinition\\nColor therapy, also known as chromatherapy, is based\\non the premise that certain colors are infused with healing\\nenergies. The therapy uses the seven colors of the rainbow\\nto promote balance and healing in the mind and body.\\nOrigins\\nColor therapy is rooted in Ayurveda, an ancient form\\nof medicine practiced in India for thousands of years.\\nAyurveda is based on the idea that every individual con-\\ntains the five basic elements of the universe: earth, water,\\nair, fire, and ether (space). These elements are present in\\nspecific proportions unique to an individual’s personality\\nand constitution. When these elements are thrown out of\\nbalance through unhealthy living habits or outside forces,\\nillness results. Ayurvedic medicine uses the energies in-\\nherent in the colors of the spectrum to restore this balance.\\nColor therapy was also used in ancient Egypt and\\nChina. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), each\\norgan is associated with a color. In qigong, healing\\nsounds are also associated with a color, which in turn\\ncorresponds to a specific organ and emotion.\\nBenefits\\nEach of the seven colors of the spectrum are associ-\\nated with specific healing properties.\\nViolet\\nViolet promotes enlightenment, revelation, and spiri-\\ntual awakening. Holistic healthcare providers use violet to\\nsoothe organs, relax muscles, and calm the nervous system.\\nIndigo\\nIndigo is also sedative and calming. It is said to pro-\\nmote intuition. Indigo may be useful in controlling\\nbleeding and abscesses.\\nBlue\\nBlue promotes communication and knowledge. It elimi-\\nnates toxins, and is used to treat liver disorders and jaundice.\\nGreen\\nBecause it is located in the middle of the color spec-\\ntrum, green is associated with balance. Green is calming,\\nand is used by Ayurvedic practitioners to promote heal-\\ning of ulcers. It is said to have antiseptic, germicide, and\\nantibacterial properties and is sometimes used by holistic\\ncolor therapists to treat bacterial infections.\\nYellow\\nYellow is a sensory stimulant associated with wis-\\ndom and clarity. Yellow is thought to have decongestant\\nand antibacterial properties, and is useful in stimulating\\nboth the digestive system and the lymphatic system.\\nOrange\\nOrange promotes pleasure, enthusiasm, and sexual\\nstimulation. Ayurvedic practitioners believe it has an-\\ntibacterial properties and may be useful in easing diges-\\ntive system discomforts (e.g., flatulence, cramps).\\nRed\\nRed promotes energy, empowerment, and stimula-\\ntion. Physically, it is thought to improve circulation and\\nstimulate red blood cell production.\\nDescription\\nThe color spectrum is composed of different fre-\\nquencies and wavelengths of light energy. Ayurvedic\\nmedicine uses the energy of colors to promote harmony\\nand healing. The colors are said to be imbued with cer-\\ntain healing properties (i.e., red is energizing, blue is\\ncalming) and the vibrations generated by each color bal-\\nance the individual.\\nHolistic healthcare providers who practice color\\ntherapy often relate the seven colors of the color spec-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2520\\nColor therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 520'),\n",

The therapeutic action of colors is related to\\nthe chakra they represent:\\n• first (root; or base of spine): red\\n• second (sacral; or pelvis/groin area): orange\\n• third (solar plexus) chakra: yellow\\n• fourth (heart) chakra: green\\n• fifth (throat) chakra: blue\\n• sixth (brow) chakra: indigo\\n• seventh (crown) chakra: violet\\nTherapeutic color can be administered in number of\\nways. Practitioners of Ayurvedic medicine wrap their pa-\\ntients in colored cloth chosen for its therapeutic hue. Pa-\\ntients suffering from depression may be wrapped in reds\\nand oranges chosen for their uplifting and energizing\\nproperties. Patients may also be bathed in light from a\\ncolor-filtered light source to enhance the healing effects\\nof the treatment.\\nAnother method of color therapy treatment recom-\\nmended in Ayurvedic medicine is to treat water with\\ncolor and then drink the water for its purported healing\\nproperties. This is achieved by placing translucent col-\\nored paper or colored plastic wrap over and around a\\nglass of water and placing the glass in direct sunlight so\\nthe water can soak up the healing properties and vibra-\\ntions of the color.\\nColor may also be used environmentally to achieve\\ncertain calming or healing effects. Paint, wall and win-\\ndow treatments, furniture, and decorative accessories may\\nall be selected in specific color families. Clothing may be\\nchosen in specific colors for its healing properties.\\nColor therapy can be used in conjunction with both\\nhydrotherapy and aromatherapy to heighten the thera-\\npeutic effect. Spas and holistic healthcare providers may\\nrecommend color baths or soaks, which combine the\\nbenefits of a warm or hot water soak with healing essen-\\ntial oils and the bright hues used in color therapy.\\nBecause color is composed of different light fre-\\nquencies, certain types of music and sound therapy are\\nsometimes used as a companion to the treatment by\\nholistic healthcare providers. One such method, known\\nas the 49th Vibrational Technique, uses a mathematical\\nformula to translate the inaudible vibrations produced in\\nthe color spectrum to their audible counterparts. Red is\\nassociated with the musical note G, orange is A, yellow\\nis A#, green is C, blue is D, indigo is D#, and violet is E.\\nBy combining both visual colors and their audible fre-\\nquency counterparts, the therapeutic value of the color\\nfrequency is thought to be enhanced.\\nPreparations\\nBefore administering any treatment, practitioners of\\nAyurvedic medicine will perform a thorough examina-\\ntion of and interview with the patient to determine his\\nprakriti, or constitution. In Ayurveda, an individual’s\\nprakriti is determined at conception and remains un-\\nchanged during his lifetime. Treatment colors will be\\nchosen based on the prakriti and the individual’s specific\\nimbalance of doshas, or energies. There are three\\ndoshas—vata, pitta, and kapha—that correspond to a\\nperson’s temperament and body type. Most are a combi-\\nnation of the three (tridosha) with one predominating.\\nIn some cases, holistic providers may take a photo-\\ngraphic image of the patient’s aura, or individual energy\\nfield, using a special camera that reads electrical impulses\\nfrom the patient’s hands. The camera produces an image\\nof the patient with bands of color(s) around the body. The\\ncolors are then analyzed to determine the patient’s unique\\naura energy pattern, and to decide what type of color\\ntherapy would be complementary to that aura.\\nPrecautions\\nWhile color therapy may be an effective treatment\\nfor promoting relaxation and overall well-being, and as\\nan adjunct, or complementary therapy in treating some\\ndisorders and illnesses, individuals with serious chronic\\nor acute health problems should not rely solely on the\\ntherapy for treatment. Anyone with a chronic or acute\\nhealth concern should seek the advice of a qualified med-\\nical practitioner.\\nSide effects\\nThere are no known side effects to common prac-\\ntices of color therapy.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nAyurvedic medicine has been a firmly entrenched\\npractice of medicine in India for thousands of years.\\nHowever, it is largely regarded as a complementary prac-\\ntice in the United States, although its popularity has\\ngrown in recent years as Ayurvedic spas and medical\\npractices have grown in number. The benefits of color\\ntherapy have not been researched extensively and it is\\nstill considered a fringe therapy by the allopathic med-\\nical community.\\nTraining & certification\\nIndividuals practicing as color therapists and/or\\npractitioners of Ayurvedic medicine do not require spe-\\ncial certification or licensing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 521\\nColor therapy\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 521'),\n",

It is secreted by the\\nmammary glands of all female mammals during the first\\nfew days of lactation. It also contains essential nutrients\\nand protease inhibitors that keep it from being destroyed\\nby the processes of digestion. Humans produce relatively\\nsmall amounts of colostrum in the first two days after\\ngiving birth, but cows produce about 9 gallons (36 L) of\\ncolostrum. Bovine colostrum can be transferred to all\\nother mammals, and is four times richer in immune fac-\\ntors than human colostrum.\\nAlthough colostrum has received widespread atten-\\ntion as a dietary supplement only since the late 1990s, it\\nhas a lengthy history of medicinal use. Ayurvedic physi-\\ncians in India have used colostrum as a treatment for\\nthousands of years. In the United States, mainstream\\nmedical practitioners recommended colostrum as a nat-\\nural antibiotic before the discovery of penilcillin and\\nsulfa drugs. In the 1950s, colostrum was used to treat\\nrheumatoid arthritis(RA). Dr. Albert Sabin, the re-\\nsearcher who developed the first oral vaccine for po-\\nliomyelitis, found that colostrum contains antibodies\\nagainst polio. He recommended colostrum as a dietary\\nsupplement for children who were vulnerable to polio.\\nThe major components of colostrum include the fol-\\nlowing substances:\\n• Immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are globulin pro-\\nteins that function as antibodies. They are the most plen-\\ntiful immune factors found in colostrum. Immunoglobu-\\nlin G (IgG) counteracts bacteria and toxins in the blood\\nand lymphatic system; immunoglobulin M (IgM) seeks\\nout and attaches itself to viruses in the circulatory sys-\\ntem; immunoglobulins D and E (IgD and IdE) remove\\nforeign substances from the bloodstream and activate al-\\nlergic reactions. High-quality colostrum is certified to\\ncontain a minmum of 16% immunoglobulins.\\n• Lactoferrin. Lactoferrin is a protein that transports iron\\nto red blood cells and helps to deprive viruses and\\nharmful bacteria of iron.\\n• Proline-rich polypeptide (PRP). PRP is a hormone that\\nregulates the thymus gland, helping to calm a hyperac-\\ntive immune system or stimulate an underactive im-\\nmune system.\\n• Growth factors. The growth factors in bovine colostrum\\ninclude insulin-like growth factors (IgF-1 and IgF-2),\\nan epithelial growth factor (EgF), transforming growth\\nfactors (TgF-A and TgF-B), and a platelet-derived\\ngrowth factor (PDGF). Growth factors stimulate nor-\\nmal growth as well as the healing and repair of aged or\\ninjured skin, muscle, and other tissues. In addition,\\ngrowth factors help the body to burn fat instead of mus-\\ncle for fuel when a person is dieting or fasting.\\n• Growth hormone. Growth hormone slows some of the\\nsigns of aging.\\n• Leukocytes. Leukocytes are white cells that stimulate\\nproduction of interferon, a protein that inhibits viruses\\nfrom reproducing.\\n• Enzymes. Colostrum contains three enzymes that oxi-\\ndize bacteria.\\n• Cytokines and lymphokines. These are substances that\\nregulate the body’s immune response, stimulate the\\nproduction of immunoglobulins, and affect cell growth\\nand repair.\\n• Vitamins. Colostrum contains small amounts of vita-\\nmins A, B12, and E.\\n• Glycoproteins.

Sulfur is a mineral that is an important building\\nblock of proteins.\\nGeneral use\\nColostrum is presently used to treat a variety of dis-\\neases and disorders. Applications that have been investi-\\ngated in clinical trials include the following:\\nBacterial and viral infections\\nA number of recent clinical studies have shown that\\ncolostrum is effective in reversing the inflammation of\\nthe digestive tract in HIV/AIDS patients caused by op-\\nportunistic infections. The antiviral, antifungal, and an-\\ntibacterial properties of colostrum enable it to kill such\\npathogens as E. coli, Candida albicans, rotaviruses, and\\nCryptosporidium.\\nIn 1980, a British researcher showed that a large\\nproportion of the antibodies and immunoglobulins in\\ncolostrum are not absorbed by the body but remain in the\\ndigestive tract. There they attack food- and water-borne\\norganisms that cause disease. More recent clinical stud-\\nies have demonstrated that colostrum is effective in pre-\\nventing intestinal infections by first keeping the bacteria\\nfrom attaching themselves to the intestinal wall, and sec-\\nondly by killing the bacteria themselves. Colostrum has\\nproved to be capable of killing Campylobacter , Heli-\\ncobacter pylori , Listeria , Salmonella , Shigellosis , and\\nfive types of streptococci.\\nAllergies and autoimmune diseases\\nThe PRP in colostrum has been demonstrated to re-\\nduce or eliminate the pain, swelling, and inflammation\\nassociated with allergies and autoimmune diseases\\n(multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, myas-\\nthenia gravis). These effects are related to PRP’s ability\\nto inhibit the overproduction of lymphocytes (white\\nblood cells) and T-cells.\\nHeart disease\\nRecent research suggests that cardiovascular disease\\nmay be caused in part by alterations in the patient’s im-\\nmune system. One study indicated that 79% of patients\\nwith heart diseases had a certain type of Chlamydia (an\\nintracellular parasite closely related to certain bacteria)\\nassociated with the formation of plaque in their arteries.\\nThe PRP in colostrum may be able to reverse heart dis-\\nease in the same way it counteracts allergies and autoim-\\nmune diseases. In addition, the growth factors and\\ngrowth hormone in colostrum appear to lower the blood\\nlevels of “bad” cholesterol while raising the blood levels\\nof “good” cholesterol. These growth factors also repair\\ndamage to heart muscle and support the growth of new\\nblood vessels in the part of the circulatory system that\\nsurrounds the heart.\\nCancer\\nSince 1985, the cytokines contained in colostrum\\nhave been a major area of research in seeking a cure for\\ncancer. Researchers have found that the lactoferrin in\\ncolostrum has some anti-cancer activity. In addition, the\\ncombination of immune factors and growth factors in\\ncolostrum appears to inhibit the growth of cancers.\\nWeight loss\\nThe growth factor called IgF-1 that is contained in\\ncolostrum is needed by the body in order to metabolize\\nfat. As humans grow older, their bodies produce less IgF-\\n1. These lower levels of growth factor are associated with\\na higher rate of type 2 diabetes in older adults and with\\nincreased difficulty losing weight in spite of exercise and\\ncareful attention to diet. While colostrum by itself will\\nnot cause weight loss, it appears to be a useful part of a\\nweight reduction program because of its IgF-1 content.\\nSports medicine\\nThe immune factors in colostrum appear to be help-\\nful in protecting athletes from infections caused by the\\nphysical and emotional stress of competition. Using\\ncolostrum as a dietary supplement also increases the effi-\\nciency of the digestive tract for athletes in training. The\\nintestines are able to make more nutrients available to\\nthe muscle cells and the body’s vital organs. A 2002 re-\\nport stated that cyclists taking 20 to 60 grams of bovine\\ncolostrums supplements per day showed significant per-\\nformance improvements following a two-hour ride.\\nOpen wounds\\nThe growth factors in colostrum have been found to\\nstimulate the growth of new skin and to repair tissues\\ndamaged by ulcers, injuries,burns, surgery, or inflam-\\nmation. They are able to do this through their direct ac-\\ntion on the cells’ DNA and RNA. Powdered colostrum\\nhas been used in topical preparations for gum disease ,\\nsensitive teeth, mouth ulcers, cuts, and burns.\\nOther\\nColostrum has been used outside clinical research to\\ntreat a variety of other conditions.

Only dairy\\ncows that meet USDA health standards and have been\\nraised on a feed supplemented with nutrients are used to\\nsupply colostrum. The calf needs four gallons of the nine\\nthat the cow produces. The remaining five gallons are\\ncollected by a USDA-certified dairy. The colostrum is\\nfrozen and kept at a temperature of 17°F (-8.3°C). After\\nthe frozen colostrum is taken to a processing plant, it is\\ncarefully thawed and evaluated for quality and im-\\nmunoglobulin content. About 30% is rejected at this\\nstage.

Its leaves\\nare hoof-shaped, and the flowers are yellow. The leaves,\\nflowers, and occasionally the root are used medicinally.\\nColtsfoot is a tough, invasive plant that lives in mar-\\nginal soil, wasteland, roadsides, and sand dunes. In some\\nareas coltsfoot is considered an undesirable weed. Al-\\nthough native to Europe, coltsfoot grows wild in North\\nAmerica and the temperate parts of China. Other names for\\ncoltsfoot are cough wort, horsefoot, horsehoof, bull’s foot,\\nass’s foot, foal’s foot, British tobacco, butterbur, field hove,\\nand flower velure. In Chinese it is called kuan dong hua.\\nGeneral use\\nColtsfoot has been used as a cough remedy in both\\nWestern herbalism and traditional Chinese medicine\\nfor at least 2,500 years. Coltsfoot was such a well-known\\nand well-respected herb in eighteenth century France\\nthat apothecary shops advertised their presence by paint-\\ning a picture of the herb on their signs. Chinese herbal-\\nists prefer to use the flower and flower buds, while West-\\nern herbalists most often choose to use the leaves.\\nColtsfoot is recommended to treat:\\n• asthma\\n• bronchitis\\n• dry, hacking cough\\n• laryngitis and hoarseness\\n• lung cancer symptoms\\n• mouth and throat irritations\\n• sore throat\\n• wheezing\\nA decoction (boiling the herb down to a concentrat-\\ned broth or tea to be taken internally) of coltsfoot root is\\nsometimes used to induce sweating. Externally, a poul-\\ntice of flowers is sometimes applied to the skin to treat\\neczema, stings, bites, and skin inflammations. Some-\\ntimes coltsfoot leaves are smoked to relieve cough.\\nModern scientific investigation shows that coltsfoot\\ncontains a substance called mucilage (about 8%) that\\ncoats and soothes the throat. It is the presence of this\\nsubstance that appears to make coltsfoot so effective in\\ntreating coughs and respiratory problems. Coltsfoot tea\\nalso appears to help clear the airways of mucus in some\\nanimal studies. Smoking coltsfoot will probably do\\nmore to irritate the throat than to soothe it.\\nInhaling steam from a pot of boiling coltsfoot leaves\\nis likely to produce little effect because so little of the\\nmedicinal material will reach the throat. The German\\nFederal Health Agency’s Commission E, established in\\n1978 to independently review and evaluate scientific lit-\\nerature and case studies pertaining to herb and plant\\nmedications, has approved the use of fresh or dried colts-\\nfoot leaf in products to treat dry cough, hoarseness, and\\nmild throat or mouth inflammations.\\nDespite evidence that coltsfoot does generally work,\\nit is not without its problems. The leaves, and to a greater\\ndegree the buds and flowers, contain compounds called\\npyrrolizidine alkaloids. These compounds are known to\\ndamage the liver. They can cause liver cancer with ex-\\ntended exposure and may also cause the blood vessels of\\nthe liver to narrow dangerously. In one laboratory study,\\nrats fed a diet of coltsfoot flower developed a high rate\\nof cancerous liver tumors.\\nIn the United States, the Food and Drug Administra-\\ntion (FDA) has labeled coltsfoot an herb of “undefined\\nsafety.” Coltsfoot leaf also falls under some legal restric-\\ntions in Austria. German authorities, however, simply rec-\\nommend that preparations containing coltsfoot leaf should\\nnot be taken for more than four to six weeks each year.\\nThere is, however, fairly unanimous agreement that the\\nlevel of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in coltsfoot flowers is much\\nhigher than the level found in the leaves, and that medici-\\nnal preparations that use the flower or flower bud should be\\navoided. Some American herbalists are recommending that\\nthe internal use of coltsfoot be discontinued as a precaution\\nuntil further research clarifies the risks involved.\\nPreparations\\nColtsfoot leaves are harvested in early summer and\\ncan be used fresh or dried. In China, the flower heads are\\ndug up in winter, before they emerge from the ground.\\nWhen the root is used, it is harvested in the autumn.\\nColtsfoot is most commonly prepared as a tea. It can\\nalso be made into a cough syrup when combined with\\nlicorice, thyme, or black cherry. Commercial prepara-\\ntions are also available.\\nPrecautions\\nThe safest course is to avoid the internal use of colts-\\nfoot. Pregnant and nursing women and children under the\\nage of six should not be given coltsfoot. People who\\nchoose to use coltsfoot should avoid ingesting more than 1\\ngram of pyrrolizidine alkaloids daily. However, accurate\\nmeasurement of pyrrolizidine alkaloids is difficult and this\\ninformation is not easily available to many consumers.\\nSide effects\\nColtsfoot is believed to increase the incidence of\\nliver damage and cancerous liver tumors in both labora-\\ntory animals and humans.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 525\\nColtsfoot\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 525'),\n",

This distinctive herb, considered\\nby the English herbalist Culpeper to be “under the do-\\nminion of the moon,” is a member of the Boraginaceae\\nfamily. The genus name Symphytum is from the Greek\\nword sympho meaning to unite. The common name com-\\nfrey is from the Latin confirmare meaning to join togeth-\\ner. The herb is named after its traditional folk use in\\ncompress and poultice preparations to speed the healing\\nof fractures , broken bones, bruises , and burns. Com-\\nfrey is a perennial native of Europe and Asia and has\\nbeen naturalized throughout North America. There are\\nabout 25 species of the herb, including prickly comfrey\\n(S. asperum ) and Russian comfrey ( S. X uplandicum ,\\nknown as okopnik). In Russian medicine, the herb is\\nconsidered poisonous when used excessively.\\nComfrey grows well in rich, moist, low meadows, or\\nalong ponds and river banks, where it may reach a height\\nof 4 ft (1.2 m). Comfrey root is large, branching, and\\nblack on the outside with a creamy white interior contain-\\ning a slimy mucilage. Hollow, erect stems, also contain-\\ning mucilage, are covered with bristly hairs that cause\\nitchingwhen in contact with the skin. The thick, some-\\nwhat succulent, veined leaves are covered with rough\\nhairs. They are alternate and lance shaped, with lower\\nleaves as large as 10 in (25 cm) in length, and dark green\\non top and light green on the underside. Small, bell-\\nshaped flowers grow from the axils of the smaller, upper\\nleaves on red stalks. Flowers are mauve to violet and\\nform in dense, hanging clusters, blooming in summer.\\nThe cup-like fruits each contain four small, black seeds.\\nGeneral use\\nComfrey root and other parts of the herb have been\\nvalued medicinally for more than 2,000 years. The specific\\nname officinaledesignates its inclusion in early lists of of-\\nficial medicinal herbs. Comfrey has been prepared as a\\npoultice or compress with healing properties for blunt in-\\njuries, fractures, swollen bruises,boils, carbuncles, vari-\\ncose ulcers, and burns. The external application of comfrey\\npreparations may minimize the formation of scar tissue.\\nPoultices were also applied to ease breast pain in breast-\\nfeeding women. Comfrey, taken internally as a tea or ex-\\npressed juice, has been used to soothe ulcers, hernias, coli-\\ntis, and to stop internal bleeding. As a gargle it has been\\nused to treat mouth sores and bleeding gums. The herbal\\ntea has also been used to treat nasal congestion and inflam-\\nmation,diarrhea, and to quiet coughing. The hot, pulped\\nroot, applied externally, was used to treat bronchitis,\\npleurisy, and to reduce pain and inflammation of sprains.\\nThe herb is thought to loosen congestion, soothe irri-\\ntated membranes and skin, reduce bleeding, tighten tissues,\\nand heal wounds. The allantoin in comfrey, found most\\nabundantly in the flowering tops, has been identified as the\\nsource of much of the herb’s healing actions. Comfrey, ap-\\nplied externally to superficial wounds, promotes the heal-\\ning of connective tissue, bones, and cartilage. Other con-\\nstituents found in comfrey include tannins, resin, essential\\noil, gum, carotene, rosmarinic acid, choline, glycosides,\\nsugars, betea-sitosterol, and steroidal saponins.\\nComfrey contains vitamins A and B12, and is high in\\ncalcium, potassium, and phosphorus. The herb has long\\nbeen used as a cooked green vegetable in early spring, and\\nthe fresh, young leaves have been added to salads. The\\nwidespread suffering caused by the Irish potato famine of\\nthe 1840s motivated Henry Doubleday, an Englishman, to\\nfund research into comfrey’s potential as a nutritional food\\ncrop. Farmers have valued comfrey as a nutritious fodder\\nfor cattle. When the leaves are soaked in rainwater for a\\nfew weeks, they will produce a valuable fertilizer for the\\ngarden, especially beneficial to tomatoes and potatoes.\\nModern herbalists, however, disagree strongly about\\ncomfrey’s safety, particularly when herbal preparations\\nare taken internally. A Japanese study in 1968 implicated\\ncomfrey constituents (known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids)\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2526\\nComfrey\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 526'),\n",

The study involved large amounts of comfrey\\nextract rather than the whole herb. The most toxic of\\nthese pyrrolizidine alkaloids, according to Varro Tyler of\\nthe Purdue University School of Pharmacy, is echimidine.\\nThis alkaloid is found primarily in Russian comfrey and\\nprickly comfrey rather than the common comfrey. How-\\never, Tyler cautions that other alkaloids toxic to the liver\\nare present in common comfrey, and commercial prepara-\\ntions may not distinguish between the types of comfrey\\ncontained in the products offered for sale. Herbal prod-\\nucts containing echimidine are prohibited for sale in\\nCanada as medicines. In fact, all comfrey products made\\nfrom the root, which contains a higher concentration of\\npyrrolizidine alkaloids, are restricted in Canada.\\nA 1978 Australian study reported that rats fed a large\\ndiet of comfrey leaf developed liver cancer. The research\\nliterature has reported some cases of liver toxicity attrib-\\nuted to long-term, internal use of comfrey. However, some\\nJapanese doctors still continue to recommend a vinegar ex-\\ntract of comfrey to treat cases of cirrhosis of the liver, de-\\nspite these previous research findings of the hazards asso-\\nciated with internal use. The research on the safety and ef-\\nfectiveness of comfrey as a medicine continues with some\\nconflicting research results. In Germany, where standard-\\nized comfrey remedies are commercially available, the al-\\nlowed dosage and duration of treatment is regulated. In the\\nUnited States, however, commercial preparations may not\\nbe standardized to meet these dosage restrictions.\\nPreparations\\nOintments, salves, and oil extracts of comfrey are\\navailable for external treatment. The crushed or pow-\\ndered root and extracted juice of the herb are used to\\nmake poultices for external applications. Comfrey ex-\\ntract is an ingredient in commercially prepared medi-\\ncines for chest congestion, coughs, and pain relief.\\nPrecautions\\nComfrey should not be used, either externally or in-\\nternally, by pregnant or breast-feeding women. Many\\nherbalists caution against internal use of comfrey. This\\ncaution is due to the dangers of the pyrrolizidine alka-\\nloids that are toxic to the liver and may have cancer-\\ncausing effects, even in small amounts. Consumers\\nshould avoid external use of comfrey on deep wounds\\nbecause the herb may promote premature healing of sur-\\nface tissue before the deeper damage has been healed.\\nWounds must be thoroughly cleaned before application\\nof comfrey remedies to avoid tissue forming over dirt\\nparticles. Comfrey preparations should not be used for\\nmore than four weeks. Gathering comfrey in the wild\\nmay be dangerous for the novice herbalist because the\\nearly spring leaves somewhat resemble the deadly ones\\nof nightshade and, in some reported cases, ingesting\\ncomfrey in preparations contaminated with deadly night-\\nshade has led to poisoning.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects are known with proper preparation\\nand administration of Symphytum officinale in external,\\ntherapeutic applications. Internal use of herbal prepara-\\ntions should be avoided pending further research.\\nInteractions\\nNone reported.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nHutchens, Alma R.

Although more than 200 different viruses can\\ncause a cold, 30–50% are caused by a group known as\\nrhinoviruses. Almost all colds clear up in less than two\\nweeks without complications.\\nDescription\\nColds, sometimes called rhinovirus or coronavirus\\ninfections , are the most common illness to strike any\\npart of the body. It is estimated that the average person\\nhas more than 50 colds during a lifetime. Anyone can get\\na cold, although preschool and grade school children\\ncatch them more frequently than adolescents and adults.\\nRepeated exposure to viruses causing colds creates par-\\ntial immunity.\\nAlthough most colds resolve on their own without\\ncomplications, they are a leading cause of visits to the doc-\\ntor and of time lost from work and school. Treating symp-\\ntoms of the common cold has given rise to a multimillion\\ndollar industry in over-the-counter medications, yet none of\\nthese medications are actually anti-viral to the rhinovirus.\\nCold season in the United States begins in early au-\\ntumn and extends through early spring. Although it is not\\ntrue that getting wet or being in a draft causes a cold (a\\nperson has to come in contact with the virus to catch a\\ncold), certain conditions may lead to increased suscepti-\\nbility. These include:\\n• fatigue and overwork\\n• emotional stress\\n• poor nutrition\\n• smoking\\n• inadequate rest or sleep\\n• living or working in crowded conditions\\nColds make the upper respiratory system less resis-\\ntant to secondary bacterial infection. Secondary bacterial\\ninfection may lead to a number of other complications,\\nincluding middle ear infection, bronchitis, pneumonia,\\nsinus infection , or strep throat . People with chronic\\nlung disease, asthma, diabetes, or a weakened immune\\nsystem are more likely to develop these complications.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nColds are caused by more than 200 different viruses.\\nThe most common groups include rhinoviruses and coro-\\nnaviruses. Different groups of viruses are more infectious\\nat different seasons of the year, but knowing the exact\\nvirus causing the cold is not important in treatment.\\nPeople with colds are contagious during the first two\\nto four days of the onset of symptoms. Colds pass from\\nperson to person in several ways. When an infected per-\\nson coughs, sneezes, or speaks, tiny fluid droplets con-\\ntaining the virus are expelled. If these are breathed in by\\nother people, the virus may establish itself in their noses\\nand airways.\\nColds may also be passed through direct contact.\\nFor example, if a person with a cold touches his runny\\nnose or watery eyes, then shakes hands with another per-\\nson, some of the virus is transferred to the uninfected\\nperson. If that person then touches his mouth, nose, or\\neyes, the virus is transferred to an environment where it\\ncan reproduce and cause a cold.\\nFinally, cold viruses can be spread through inani-\\nmate objects (door knobs, telephones, toys) that become\\ncontaminated with the virus. This is a common method\\nof transmission in child care centers. Another vector of\\ntransmission is air travel, due to closed air circulation in\\nbuildings.\\nOnce acquired, the cold virus attaches itself to the\\nlining of the nasal passages and sinuses. This causes the\\ninfected cells to release a chemical called histamine.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2528\\nCommon cold\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nCarbuncle —A skin infection creating deep, pus-\\nfilled boils.\\nPleurisy —Inflammation of the pleura, the mem-\\nbranes enclosing the lungs and lining the chest\\ncavity.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 528'),\n",

Rhinovirus causes the\\ncommon cold. (CHSP/Custom Medical Stock Photo. Repro-\\nduced by permission.)\\nHistamine increases the blood flow to the infected cells,\\ncausing swelling, congestion, and increased mucus pro-\\nduction. Within one to three days, the infected person be-\\ngins to show cold symptoms.\\nThe first cold symptoms are usually a tickle in the\\nthroat, runny nose, and sneezing . The initial discharge\\nfrom the nose is clear and thin. Later, it may change to a\\nthick yellow or greenish discharge. Most adults do not\\ndevelop a fever when they catch a cold. Young children\\nmay develop a low fever of up to 102°F (38.9°C).\\nOther symptoms of a cold include coughing, sneez-\\ning, nasal congestion, headache , muscle ache, chills,\\nsore throat, hoarseness, watery eyes, fatigue, dull hear-\\ning and blocked eustachian tube (a danger when flying),\\nand lack of appetite. The cough that accompanies a cold\\nis usually intermittent and dry.\\nMost people begin to feel better four to five days\\nafter their cold symptoms become noticeable. All symp-\\ntoms are generally gone within 10 days, except for a dry\\ncough that may linger for up to three weeks.\\nColds make people more susceptible to secondary\\nbacterial infections such as strep throat, middle ear in-\\nfections, and sinus infections. A person should seek a\\ndoctor’s consultation if the cold does not begin to im-\\nprove within a week. If an individual experiences chest\\npain, fever for more than a few days, difficulty breath-\\ning, bluish lips or fingernails, a cough that brings up\\ngreenish-yellow or grayish sputum, skin rash, swollen\\nglands, or whitish spots on the tonsils or throat, then that\\nperson should also consult a doctor to see if they have\\nacquired a secondary bacterial infection that needs to be\\ntreated with an antibiotic.\\nPeople who have emphysema, chronic lung disease,\\ndiabetes, or a weakened immune system—either from\\ndiseases such as AIDS or leukemia , or as the result of\\nmedications, (corticosteroids, chemotherapy drugs)—\\nshould consult their doctor if they get a cold. People with\\nthese health problems are more likely to get a secondary\\ninfection.\\nDiagnosis\\nColds are diagnosed by observing a person’s symp-\\ntoms and symptom history. There are no laboratory tests\\nreadily available to detect the cold virus. However, a\\ndoctor may do a throat or nasal culture, or blood test to\\nrule out a secondary infection.\\nInfluenza is sometimes confused with a cold, but\\nthe flu causes much more severe symptoms, and is gen-\\nerally accompanied by a fever. Allergies to molds or pol-\\nlens also can cause a runny nose and eyes. Allergies are\\nusually more persistent than the common cold. An aller-\\ngist or a physician can do tests to determine if the cold-\\nlike symptoms are being caused by an allergic reaction.\\nAlso, some people get a runny nose when they go out-\\nside in winter and breathe cold air. This type of runny\\nnose, however, is not a symptom of a cold.\\nTreatment\\nThe patient should drink plenty of fluids and eat nu-\\ntritious foods. In fact, the old adage, “Feed a cold, starve\\na fever” was scientifically proven true in 2002. Dutch\\nscientists found that cold-fighting immune responses\\nrose after consuming a full meal while fasting increased\\nthose that combat most fevers. Chicken soup with gin-\\nger, scallions, and rice noodles is nutritious and has\\nproperties that help the patient to recover. Rest, to allow\\nthe body to fight infection, is very important. Gargling\\nwith saltwater (half teaspoon salt in one cup of water)\\nhelps to soothe a sore throat. A vaporizer also will make\\nthe patient feel more comfortable. Rubbing petroleum\\njelly or some other lubricant under the nose will prevent\\nirritation from frequent nose blowing. For babies, nasal\\nmucus should be suctioned gently with an infant nasal\\naspirator. It may be necessary to soften the mucus first\\nwith a few drops of salt water.\\nHerbals\\nHerbals can be taken to stimulate the immune sys-\\ntem, for antiviral activity, and to relieve symptoms. The\\nfollowing herbs are used to treat colds:\\n• Ginger (Zingiber officinale) reduces fever and pain, has\\na sedative effect, settles the stomach, and suppresses\\ncough.\\n• Forsythia (Forsythia suspensa ) fruit can be taken as a\\ntea for its anti-inflammatory, fever reducing, and an-\\ntimicrobial properties.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 529'),\n",

Conjunctivitis can be acute or\\nchronic depending upon how long the condition lasts, the\\nseverity of symptoms, and the type of organism or agent\\ninvolved. It can affect one or both eyes. If it is caused by\\ninfection, it can be easily transmitted to others during\\nclose physical contact, particularly among children in a\\ndaycare center. Other names for conjunctivitis include\\npinkeye and redeye.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nConjunctivitis may be caused by a viral infection,\\nsuch as a cold, acute respiratory infection, or disease\\nsuch as measles, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. Symp-\\ntoms may include mild to severe discomfort in one or\\nboth eyes; redness; swelling of the eyelids; and a watery,\\nyellow, or greenish discharge. The symptoms may last\\nanywhere from several days to weeks. Infection with an\\nadenovirus, however, may also cause a significant\\namount of pus-like discharge and a scratchy sensation in\\nthe eye. These symptoms may also be accompanied by\\nswelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes near the ear.\\nBacterial conjunctivitis may occur in adults or chil-\\ndren. It is caused by such organisms as Staphylococcus ,\\nStreptococcus pneumoniae , and Haemophilus . Symp-\\ntoms of bacterial conjunctivitis include a pus-like dis-\\ncharge and crusty eyelids after awakening. Redness of\\nthe conjunctivae can be mild to severe and may be ac-\\ncompanied by swelling. Persons with symptoms of con-\\njunctivitis who are sexually active may possibly be in-\\nfected with chlamydia or with the bacteria that cause\\ngonorrhea. There may be large amounts of pus-like dis-\\ncharge. Symptoms may include hypersensitivity to light\\n(photophobia), a watery mucous discharge, and tender-\\nness in the lymph nodes near the ear that may persist for\\nup to three months.\\nConjunctivitis may also be caused by such environ-\\nmental hazards as wind, smoke, dust, and allergic reac-\\ntions caused by pollen, dust, or grass. Symptoms range\\nfrom itching and redness to a mucous discharge. Persons\\nwho wear contact lenses may develop allergic conjunc-\\ntivitis caused by the various eye solutions and foreign\\nproteins contained in them.\\nOther less common causes of conjunctivitis include\\nlooking at the sun, sun lamps, plant lamps, or the electrical\\narcs used during welding, as well as defective tear ducts.\\nDiagnosis\\nAccurate diagnosis of conjunctivitis centers on tak-\\ning the patient’s history to learn when symptoms began,\\nhow long the condition has been going on, the symptoms\\nexperienced, and other predisposing factors. Diagnostic\\ntests may include an eye examination, culture, or labora-\\ntory test. The discharge may be cultured and Gram-\\nstained to determine the organism responsible for causing\\nthe condition. Cultures and smears are relatively painless.\\nTreatment\\nConjunctivitis caused by gonococcal or chlamydial\\ninfection usually requires prescription antibiotics. Inter-\\nnal immune enhancement with dietary supplements can\\naid in the resolution of allergic and viral conjunctivitis.\\nRemoval of the allergic agent is an essential step in treat-\\ning allergic conjunctivitis. As with any of the recom-\\nmended treatments, however, if no improvement is seen\\nwithin 48–72 hours, a physician should be consulted.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2532\\nConjunctivitis\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 532'),\n",

It may be caused by a viral infection, such as a cold\\nor acute respiratory infection, or by such diseases as\\nmeasles, herpes simplex, or herpes zoster. (Illustration by\\nElectronic Illustrators Group. The Gale Group.)\\nNutritional therapy\\nThe following dietary changes may be helpful in\\nmanaging conjunctivitis:\\n• Taking 25,000 IU (international units) of beta-carotene\\ntwice daily for 7 days.\\n• Taking 500–1000 mg of vitamin C three times daily\\nfor 7 days.\\n• Taking 25 mg of zinc with meals three times daily for 7\\ndays.\\nHomeopathy\\nThere are a number of homeopathic remedies de-\\nsigned to treat acute conjunctivitis. These include Argen-\\ntum nitricum (silver nitrate), pulsatilla (windflower), bel-\\nladonna, Arsenicum album (arsenic trioxide), sulphur\\n(elemental sulphur) and eyebright (Euphrasia offici-\\nnalis). Eye drops prepared with homeopathic remedies\\ncan be a good substitute for pharmaceutical eye drops.\\nHerbal therapy\\nHerbal eyewashes made with eyebright (1 tsp dried\\nherb steeped in 1 cup of boiling water for 10 minutes,\\nthen strained and used at once) or chamomile (Matri-\\ncaria recutita; 2–3 tsp in 1 pint of boiling water) may be\\nhelpful. Eyewashes should be strained and cooled before\\nuse. They should be discarded promptly after use, as old\\ninfusions may become unsterile.\\nOther simple home remedies may help relieve the\\ndiscomfort associated with conjunctivitis. A boric acid\\neyewash (1 tsp boric acid in 1 cup of water) can be used\\nto clean and soothe the eyes. A warm compress applied\\nto the eyes for 5–10 minutes three times a day can help\\nrelieve the discomfort of bacterial and viral conjunctivi-\\ntis. A clean washcloth soaked in warm water can be used\\nas a warm compress. The patient should close both eyes\\nand apply the compress to the affected eye. A cool com-\\npress or cool, damp tea bags (of black tea or chamomile\\ntea) placed on the eyes can ease the discomfort of con-\\njunctivitis.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe treatment of conjunctivitis depends on what\\ncaused the condition. In all cases, warm compresses ap-\\nplied to the affected eye several times a day may help to\\nreduce discomfort.\\nConjunctivitis due to a viral infection, particularly\\nthose due to adenoviruses, are usually treated by apply-\\ning warm compresses to the eye(s) and applying topical\\nantimicrobial ointments to prevent secondary bacterial\\ninfections.\\nViral conjunctivitis may cause blindness and should be\\nreferred to an ophthalmologist. Topical steroids are com-\\nmonly prescribed in combination with antiviral therapy.\\nIn cases of bacterial conjunctivitis, a physician may\\nprescribe an antibiotic eye ointment or eye drops con-\\ntaining sodium sulfacetamide (Sulamyd) to be applied\\ndaily for 7–14 days. Patients should contact their doctors\\nif the eyes fail to improve after 72 hours. Antibiotic eye\\ndrops are instilled (put in drop by drop) into the eye by\\nhaving the patient tilt the head back and pulling down\\nthe lower eye lid. The patient is asked to look upward\\nwhile the medication is instilled into the conjunctival\\nsac. It is important to avoid touching the dropper to the\\nskin, in order to prevent the eye discharge from contami-\\nnating the antibiotic solution. After the drops have been\\ninstilled, the patient should gently close the eyes for 1\\nminute in order not to squeeze out any of the medication.\\nFor cases of conjunctivitis caused by a gonococcus\\n(the bacteria that causes gonorrhea), a physician may pre-\\nscribe an injection of ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and a topical\\nantibiotic ointment containing erythromycin or bactracin\\nto be applied four times daily for 2–3 weeks. For chlamy-\\ndial infections, a topical antibiotic ointment containing\\nerythromycin (Ilotycin) may be prescribed to be applied\\n1–2 times daily. To apply an antibiotic ointment, the eye\\nshould be gently wiped with a sterile cotton ball moist-\\nened with sterile water to remove any discharge.

Bowel habits vary, but an adult who has not had a\\nbowel movement in three days or a child who has not had\\na bowel movement in four days is considered constipated.\\nDescription\\nConstipation is one of the most common medical\\ncomplaints in the United States. It can occur at any age\\nand is more common among individuals who resist the\\nurge to move their bowels at the body’s signal. This often\\nhappens when children start school or enter daycare and\\nfeel shy about asking permission to use the bathroom.\\nConstipation is more common in women than in men\\nand is especially apt to occur during pregnancy. Age alone\\ndoes not increase the frequency of constipation, but elderly\\npeople are more likely to suffer from the condition.\\nAlthough this condition is rarely serious, it can lead to:\\n• bowel obstruction\\n• chronic constipation\\n• hemorrhoids (a mass of dilated veins in swollen tissue\\naround the anus)\\n• hernia (a protrusion of an organ through a tear in the\\nmuscle wall)\\n• spastic colitis (irritable bowel syndrome , a condition\\ncharacterized by alternating periods of diarrhea and\\nconstipation)\\n• laxative dependency\\nChronic constipation may be a symptom of colorec-\\ntal cancer , depression , diabetes, diverticulosis (small\\npouches in the muscles of the large intestine), lead poi-\\nsoning, or Parkinson’s disease. An opioid overdose (as\\nin excessive codeine from cough suppressants or heroin\\naddiction) also may result in constipation.\\nIn someone who is elderly or disabled, constipation\\nmay be a symptom of bowel impaction, a more serious\\ncondition in which feces are trapped in the lower part of\\nthe large intestine. A doctor should be called if an elderly\\nor disabled person is constipated for more than a week or\\nif a child seems to be constipated.\\nA doctor should be notified whenever constipation\\noccurs after starting a new prescription, vitamin, or min-\\neral supplement or is accompanied by blood in the stools,\\nchanges in bowel patterns,fever, or abdominal pain.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nConstipation usually results from not getting enough\\nexercise , not drinking enough water or clear fluids, or\\nfrom a diet that does not include an adequate amount of\\nfiber-rich foods like beans, bran cereals, fruits, raw veg-\\netables, rice, and whole-grain breads.\\nOther causes of constipation include anal fissure (a\\ntear or crack in the lining of the anus), chronic kidney\\nfailure, colon or rectal cancer, depression, hypercalcemia\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 535'),\n",

The doc-\\ntor uses his fingers to see if there is a hardened mass in\\nthe abdomen and may perform a rectal examination.\\nOther diagnostic procedures include a barium enema,\\nwhich reveals blockage inside the intestine; laboratory\\nanalysis of blood and stool samples for internal bleeding\\nor other symptoms of systemic disease; and a sigmoi-\\ndoscopy (examination of the sigmoid area of the colon\\nwith a flexible tube equipped with a magnifying lens).\\nPhysical and psychological assessments and a de-\\ntailed history of bowel habits are especially important\\nwhen an elderly person complains of constipation.\\nTreatment\\nInitially, alternative practitioners will suggest that the\\npatient drink an adequate amount of water each day (six to\\neight glasses), exercise on a regular basis, and eat a diet\\nhigh in soluble and insoluble fibers. Soluble fibers include\\npectin, flax, and gums. Insoluble fibers include psyllium\\nand brans from grains like wheat and oats. Fresh fruits and\\nvegetables contain both soluble and insoluble fibers, and\\nsince constipation is aggravated by folate, calcium, and\\nmagnesiumdeficiencies, sources of these nutrients, such as\\nasparagus, spinach, parsley, and other dark green leafy\\nvegetables, should be part of the daily diet. Various fruit\\njuices can also help maintain normal bowel function; sor-\\nbitol, the natural sugar found in apple juice has known laxa-\\ntive properties. Castor oil, applied topically to the abdomen\\nand covered by a heat source (a heating pad or hot water\\nbottle), can help relieve constipation when used nightly for\\n20-30 minutes. For babies, about 1 tablespoon of corn syrup\\nmixed with warm water might help relieve constipation.\\nAcupressure\\nThis form of acupuncture is said to relax the ab-\\ndomen, ease discomfort, and stimulate regular bowel\\nmovements when diet and exercise fail to do so. After\\nlying down, patients close their eyes and take deep\\nbreaths. For two minutes, the practitioner applies gentle\\nfingertip pressure to a point about two inches below the\\nnavel. Acupressure can also be applied to the outer\\nedges of one elbow crease and maintained for 30 sec-\\nonds before pressing the crease of the other elbow. This\\nshould be done three times a day to relieve constipation.\\nAromatherapy\\nSix drops of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) and\\nsix drops of thyme (Thymus spp. ) diluted by one ounce\\nof almond oil, olive oil, or another carrier oil can relieve\\nconstipation when used to massage the abdomen. A cir-\\ncular motion for massage is recommended, beginning up\\nthe right side of the abdomen, coming across the top, and\\ndown the left side.

There are also laxative herbs that\\nassist with bowel movement. Two of these are senna and\\nbuckthorn. These laxative herbs are stronger acting on\\nelimination than bitters and can sometimes cause cramp-\\ning (mixing them with a calming herb like fennel or car-\\naway can help reduce cramping). Both senna and buck-\\nthorn are powerful herbs that are best used with direction\\nfrom an experienced practitioner, since they can have ad-\\nverse side effects and the patient may become dependent\\non them. In fact, practitioners caution that senna can\\ncause severe cramping.\\nYoga\\nThe knee-chest position, said to relieve gas and\\nstimulate abdominal organs, involves:\\n• standing straight with arms at the sides\\n• lifting the right knee toward the chest\\n• grasping the right ankle with the left hand\\n• pulling the leg as close to the chest as possible\\n• holding the position for about eight seconds\\n• repeating these steps with the left leg\\nThe cobra position, which can be repeated as many\\nas four times a day, involves:\\n• lying on the stomach with legs together\\n• placing the palms just below the shoulders, holding el-\\nbows close to the body\\n• inhaling, then lifting the head (face forward) and chest\\noff the floor\\n• keeping the navel in contact with the floor\\n• looking as far upward as possible\\n• holding this position for three to six seconds\\n• exhaling and lowering the chest\\nThe spine twist is another pose that is recommended\\nfor daily use in relieving constipation. Practicing relax-\\nation and meditation can also have a powerful effect on\\nthe digestive system. Slow, steady music can relieve ten-\\nsion that leads to constipation.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nIf changes in diet and activity fail to relieve occa-\\nsional constipation, an over-the-counter laxative may be\\nused for a few days. Preparations that soften stools or\\nadd bulk (bran, psyllium, ducosate sodium) work more\\nslowly but are safer than Epsom salts and other harsh\\nlaxatives or herbal laxatives containing senna ( Cassia\\nsenna) or buckthorn ( Rhamnus purshianna ), which, if\\nused long term, can harm the nerves and lining of the\\ncolon because they are peristaltic stimulants.\\nA woman who is pregnant should never use a laxa-\\ntive. She can use flaxseed, bran, ducosate sodium, prunes,\\nor oatmeal. Anyone who is experiencing abdominal pain,\\nnausea, or vomiting should also avoid laxatives. A warm-\\nwater or mineral oil enema can relieve constipation, and a\\nnon-digestible sugar (lactulose) or special electrolyte solu-\\ntion is recommended for adults and older children with\\nstubborn symptoms. If a patient has an impacted bowel,\\nthe doctor may insert a gloved finger into the rectum and\\ngently dislodge the hardened feces.\\nIn 2002, a new study compared a non-toxic food in-\\ngredient called polyethylene glycol to lactulose for re-\\nlieving constipation in children. A preliminary study\\nshowed that it may work faster, prove easier to adminis-\\nter, and be just as safe and effective. However, more re-\\nsearch was suggested before recommending the sub-\\nstance over lactulose.\\nExpected results\\nChanges in diet and exercise usually eliminate the\\nproblem of constipation.\\nPrevention\\nMost Americans consume between 11-18 grams of\\nfiber a day. Consumption of 30 grams of fiber and be-\\ntween 6-8 glasses of water each day can generally prevent\\nconstipation, and 35 grams of fiber a day (an amount\\nequal to five servings of fruits and vegetables, and a large\\nbowl of high-fiber cereal) can relieve constipation. Fiber\\nsupplements containing psyllium (Plantago psyllium )\\nusually become effective within about two days and can\\nbe used every day without causing dependency. Pow-\\ndered flaxseed (Linium usitatissimum ) works the same\\nway. Insoluble fiber, like wheat or oat bran, is as effective\\nas psyllium but may give the patient gas at first.\\nDaily use of 500 mg vitamin C and 400 mg magne-\\nsium can prevent constipation. If symptoms do occur,\\neach dosage can be increased by 100 mg a day, up to a\\nmaximum of 5,000 mg vitamin C and 1,000 mg magne-\\nsium. Use of preventive doses should be resumed after\\nrelief occurs. If the patient developes diarhea, the vita-\\nmin C should be decreased.

There are\\ntwo kinds of contact dermatitis, irritant and allergic.\\nDescription\\nThousands of natural and synthetic substances can\\ncause contact dermatitis, which is the most common skin\\ncondition requiring medical attention, and the foremost\\nsource of work-related disease. Florists, domestic work-\\ners, hairdressers, food preparers, and employees in heavy\\nindustry, construction, carpentry, dry cleaning, farming,\\nhealth care, and the military are the people most at risk\\nof contracting work-related contact dermatitis. Ameri-\\ncans spend roughly $300 million a year in their quest for\\nrelief from contact dermatitis, not counting the consider-\\nable sums devoted by governments and businesses to\\nregulating and policing the use of skin-threatening\\nchemicals in the workplace. But exactly how many peo-\\nple suffer from contact dermatitis remains unclear; a\\n1997 article in the Journal of the American Medical As-\\nsociation notes that figures ranging from 1–15% have\\nbeen put forward for Western industrial nations.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIrritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is the more com-\\nmonly reported of the two types of contact dermatitis,\\naccounting for about 80% of cases. It can be caused by\\nsoaps, detergents, solvents, adhesives, fiberglass, and\\nother substances that are able to directly injure the skin.\\nMost attacks are mild and confined to the hands and\\nforearms, but can affect any part of the body that comes\\nin contact with the irritating substance. The symptoms\\ncan take many forms: redness,itching , crusting,\\nswelling, blistering, oozing, dryness, scaliness, thicken-\\ning of the skin, and a feeling of warmth at the site of\\ncontact. In extreme cases severe blistering can occur and\\nopen sores can form. Occupations that require frequent\\nskin exposure to water, such as hairdressing and food\\npreparation, can make the skin more susceptible to ICD.\\nAllergic contact dermatitis (ACD) results when re-\\npeated exposure to an allergen (an allergy-causing sub-\\nstance) triggers an immune response that inflames the\\nskin. Tens of thousands of drugs, pesticides, cosmetics,\\nfood additives, commercial chemicals, and other sub-\\nstances have been identified as potential allergens. Fewer\\nthan 30, however, are responsible the majority of ACD\\ncases. Common culprits include poison ivy, poison oak,\\nand poison sumac; fragrances and preservatives in cos-\\nmetics and personal care products; latex items, including\\ngloves and condoms; and formaldehyde. Many people\\nfind that they are allergic to the nickel in inexpensive\\ncostume jewelry. ACD is usually confined to the area of\\nskin that comes in contact with the allergen, typically the\\nhands or face. Symptoms range from mild to severe and\\nresemble those of ICD.

More difficult cases\\nrequire patch testing to identify the specific allergen.\\nTwo methods of patch testing are currently used.\\nThe most widely used method, the Finn chamber\\nmethod, employs a multiwell aluminum patch. Each well\\nis filled with a small amount of the allergen being tested\\nand the patch is taped to normal skin on the patient’s\\nupper back. After 48 hours the patch is removed and an\\ninitial reading is taken. A second reading is made a few\\ndays later. The second method of patch testing involves\\napplying a small amount of the test substance directly to\\nnormal skin and covering it with a dressing that keeps air\\nout and keeps the test substance in (occlusive dressing).\\nAfter 48 hours the dressing is taken off to see if a reac-\\ntion has occurred. Identifying the allergen may require\\nrepeated testing, can take weeks or months, and is not al-\\nways successful. Moreover, patch testing works only\\nwith ACD, though it is considered an essential step in\\nruling out ICD.\\nTreatment\\nHerbal therapy\\nHerbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat\\nskin disorders, including contact dermatitis. An experi-\\nenced herbalist or naturopathic doctor can recommend\\nthe remedies that will be most effective for a person’s\\ncondition. Among the herbs often recommended are:\\n• Burdock (Arctium lappa ). Burdock is taken internally\\nas a tea or tincture.\\n• Calendula (Calendula officinalis). Calendula is a natur-\\nal antiseptic and anti-inflammatory agent. It is applied\\ntopically in a lotion, ointment, or oil to the affected area.\\n• Aloe (Aloe barbadensis). Aloes soothes skin irritations.\\nIts gel is applied topically to the affected area.\\nPoison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac are com-\\nmon culprits in cases of allergic contact dermatitis. Fol-\\nlowing exposure to these plants, the development of the\\ncharacteristic rash may be prevented by washing the area\\nwith soap and water within 15 minutes of exposure. The\\nleaves of jewelweed (Impatiens spp.), which often grows\\nnear poison ivy, may neutralize the poison ivy allergen if\\nrubbed on the skin right after contact. Several topical\\nherbal remedies may help relieve the itching associated\\nwith allergic contact dermatitis, including the juice of\\nplantainleaves (Plantago major); a paste made of equal\\nparts of green clay and goldenseal root ( Hydrastis\\ncanadensis ); a paste made of salt, water, clay, and pep-\\npermint (Mentha piperita) oil; and calamine lotion.\\nHomeopathy\\nA homeopath treating a patient with contact der-\\nmatitis will do a thorough investigation of the individ-\\nual’s history and exposures before prescribing a remedy.\\nCommon homeopathic remedies include:\\n• Rhus toxicodendron\\n• Croton tiglium\\n• ledum\\n• anacardium\\n• graphites\\n• sulfur\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe best treatment for contact dermatitis is to identi-\\nfy the allergen or irritating substance and avoid further\\ncontact with it. If the culprit is, for instance, a cosmetic,\\navoidance is a simple matter, but in some situations, such\\nas an allergy to an essential workplace chemical for\\nwhich no substitute can be found, avoidance may be im-\\npossible or force the sufferer to find new work or make\\nother drastic changes in his or her life.

It is consid-\\nered a trace mineral because it is needed in very small\\namounts. Only 70–80 mg of copper are found in the\\nbody of a normal healthy person. Even though the body\\nneeds very little, copper is an important nutrient that\\nholds many vital functions in the body.\\nCopper is essential for normal development of the\\nbody because it:\\n• Participates in a wide variety of important enzymatic\\nreactions in the body.\\n• Is a component of or a cofactor for approximately 50\\ndifferent enzymes. These enzymes need copper to func-\\ntion properly.\\n• Is essential for iron absorption and transport. Iron is\\nneeded to make hemoglobin, a main component of red\\nblood cells. Therefore, copper deficiency is often\\nlinked to iron-deficiency anemia.\\n• Is required to build elastin and collagen, which are an\\nimportant components of bones and connective tissues.\\nTherefore, copper is believed to protect the bones and\\njoints against degeneration and osteoporosis.\\n• Is required for melanin production. People with copper\\ndeficiency may have pale skin and hair.\\n• Is a key mineral for the immune system. Copper pro-\\nmotes wound healing. Studies show that premature in-\\nfants or children with genetic copper defects are at high\\nrisk of getting infections and would significantly im-\\nprove with copper supplementation.\\n• Attacks free radicals. Copper is a strong antioxidant. It\\nworks by attaching itself to the enzyme Superoxide dis-\\nmutase (SOD). Copper also binds to a protein to form\\nceruloplasmin, which is an antioxidant.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2540\\nCopper\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAntibiotics—Substances used against microorgan-\\nisms that cause infection.\\nCorticosteroids —A group of anti-inflammatory\\nsubstances often used to treat skin conditions.\\nImmune response—The protective reaction by the\\nimmune system against foreign antigens (sub-\\nstances that the body perceives as potentially dan-\\ngerous).

Copper\\ndeficiency is also associated with poor blood glucose\\ncontrol.\\n• Is needed for normal functioning of the cardiovascular\\nsystem.\\n• Protects the structure and function of the nervous sys-\\ntem, including the brain. Copper protects nerve fiber by\\nmaintaining myelin, the insulating sheath that sur-\\nrounds nerve cells.

Copper deficiency used to\\nbe relatively rare because the body requires so little of it,\\nonly about 2 mg per day. In addition, it is available natu-\\nrally in a variety of foods such as whole grains, shellfish,\\nnuts, beans, and leafy vegetables. Additional sources of\\ncopper are the copper water pipes that run through\\nhomes or the copper cookware in the kitchen. These\\nsources leach copper into the water we drink and the\\nfood we eat. The level of copper in drinking water is\\nsometimes so high that it becomes a public concern.\\nHowever, scientists now realize that copper deficiency,\\nespecially borderline cases, is more common than once\\nthought. Copper deficiency is currently on the rise due to\\na decrease of whole foods in the diet and high consump-\\ntion of fatty and processed foods.\\nIt was discovered in 2001 that vegetarian diets gen-\\nerally contain more copper, but that the absorption effi-\\nciency was lower for lacto-ovo vegetarians than for non-\\nvegetarians. The study also showed that the increased\\namounts of copper in the vegetarian diets allow for\\ngreater copper content.\\nBesides dietary causes, certain diseases or condi-\\ntions may reduce copper absorption, transport or in-\\ncrease its requirements, resulting in abnormally low cop-\\nper blood levels. Increased copper intake through diet or\\nsupplementation may be necessary in the following con-\\nditions:\\n• premature infants fed only cow’s milk\\n• pregnant women\\n• malnutrition\\n• celiac disease, sprue, cystic fibrosis, or short-bowel\\nsyndrome (these diseases cause poor absorption of di-\\netary copper)\\n• kidney disease\\n• high consumption of zinc or iron (these minerals inter-\\nfere with copper absorption)\\n• highly processed foods (copper is stripped away during\\nfood processing)\\n• Menkes syndrome (copper deficiency is caused by ge-\\nnetic defects of copper transport; Menkes syndrome pa-\\ntients cannot use copper supplied by the diet efficiently)\\nSymptoms of copper deficiency include:\\n• anemia\\n• malnourished infants\\n• prominently dilated veins\\n• pale hair or skin\\n• poorly formed bones\\n• nervous system disorders\\n• high cholesterol levels\\n• heart disease\\n• loss of taste\\n• increased susceptibility to infections\\n• infertility\\n• birth defects\\nExceeding the daily requirement is dangerous, how-\\never, because copper toxicity commonly occurs.

In this dis-\\nease, copper is not eliminated properly and is allowed to\\naccumulate to toxic levels. Copper is therefore present at\\nhigh concentration where it should not be, such as in the\\nliver, the lens of the eye, kidneys, or brain.\\nDisease prevention\\nCopper is a good antioxidant. It works together with\\nan antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (SOD), to\\nprotect cell membranes from being destroyed by free\\nradicals. Free radicals are any molecules that are missing\\none electron. Because this is an unbalanced and unstable\\nstate, a radical is desperately finding ways to complete\\nits pair. Therefore, it reacts to any nearby molecules to\\neither steal an electron or give away the unpaired one. In\\nthe process, free radicals initiate chain reactions that de-\\nstroy cell structures. Like other antioxidants , copper\\nscavenges or cleans up these highly reactive radicals and\\nchanges them into inactive, less harmful compounds.\\nTherefore, it can help prevent cancer. In 2001, a study\\nreported that concentrations of copper sulfate and ascor-\\nbate may inhibit breast cancer growth. With further\\nstudy, the combination may even prove useful as a\\nchemotherapy agent for certain breast cancer patients.\\nCopper may also help prevent degenerative diseases\\nor conditions such as premature aging, heart disease, au-\\ntoimmune diseases, arthritis, cataracts , Alzheimer’s\\ndisease, or diabetes.\\nOsteoporosis\\nCopper may play a role in preventing osteoporosis.\\nCalcium and vitamin D have long been considered the\\nmainstay of osteoporosis treatment and prevention.\\nHowever, a recent study has shown that they can be even\\nmore effective in increasing bone density and preventing\\nosteoporosis if they are used in combination with copper\\nand two other trace minerals, zinc and manganese.\\nRheumatoid arthritis\\nCopper has been a folklore remedy for rheumatoid\\narthritis since 1500 B.C. in ancient Egypt. Some people\\nbelieve that wearing jewelry made of copper may relieve\\narthritic symptoms. To evaluate the effect of copper for\\nthe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Dr. Walker and his\\ncolleagues conducted a study of 77 arthritic patients. Pa-\\ntients were divided into two groups: treatment group\\nwearing copper jewelry and placebo group wearing noth-\\ning or aluminum jewelry. In this study, patients who\\nwore copper bracelets felt significantly better than those\\nin the placebo group. In addition, patients in the treat-\\nment group reported recurrences of symptoms after the\\nbracelets were removed. To explain the effects of the\\ncopper bracelets, these researchers suggested that copper\\ncontained in the bracelets was dissolved in sweat and\\nthen absorbed through the skin. They suspected that cop-\\nper’s effectiveness may be related to its role as an antiox-\\nidant. They also believe that copper may function as both\\nan anti-inflammatory agent and as an antioxidant. Thus,\\nit is possibly effective in reducing inflammatory re-\\nsponse to such conditions as rheumatoid arthritis.\\nPreparations\\nCopper is contained in many multivitamin/mineral\\npreparations. It is also available as a single ingredient in\\nthe form of tablets. These tablets should be swallowed\\nwhole with a cup of water, preferably with meals, to\\navoid stomach upset. A person may choose any of the\\nfollowing preparations: copper gluconate, copper sulfate,\\nor copper citrate. However, copper gluconate may be the\\nleast irritating to the stomach.\\nZinc and copper compete with each other for ab-\\nsorption in the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, exces-\\nsive copper intake may cause zinc deficiency, and vice\\nversa. Therefore, a person should take zinc and copper\\nsupplements together in ratios of 10:1 or 15:1.\\nPrecautions\\nThose adding copper supplements to their diets\\nshould consider:\\n• Informing their doctors for proper instruction and mon-\\nitoring of side effects. Copper toxicity due to excessive\\ndoses of copper supplements has been reported.\\n• Although there currently is no recommended daily al-\\nlowance (RDA) established for copper, 2 mg of copper\\nper day is considered sufficient and safe. Nausea and\\nvomiting may occur in persons taking more than 20 mg\\nof copper daily.\\n• It is not known if copper supplementation may harm a\\ngrowing fetus. However, as with any drugs, pregnant or\\nnursing women should not take copper or any other sup-\\nplements or drugs without first consulting their doctors.\\n• In certain areas, drinking water may contain high levels\\nof copper. Periodic checks of copper levels in drinking\\nwater may be necessary.\\n• Because individual antioxidants often work together as\\na team to defend the body against free radicals, the bal-\\nance between copper, zinc, and iron must be main-\\ntained. Excessive intake of one nutrient might result in\\na deficiency of other minerals and decreased resistance\\nto infections and increased risk of heart disease, dia-\\nbetes, arthritis, and other diseases.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2542\\nCopper\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 542'),\n",

C. chinensis is native to the cooler parts of Asia\\nand is extensively cultivated in Szechwan province in\\nChina. C. trifolia is native to eastern North America as far\\nsouth as the mountains of Tennessee. Other names for the\\nvarious species of coptis used in healing include\\ngoldthread, Chinese goldthread mouth root, cankerroot,\\nyellowroot, coptidis, mishmi bitter, and chonlin. The Chi-\\nnese name for C. chinensis is huang lian.\\nGeneral use\\nCoptis, or huang lian , has a long history of use in\\nChina. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), coptis is\\nused to treat conditions associated with excess dampness\\nand excess heat, such as insomnia and irritability. Heat\\nin TCM means excessive activity, not high temperature,\\nalthough the diseased part of the body could be red or in-\\nflamed. Coptis is said to have a cold nature and a bitter\\ntaste. In TCM, coptis is considered one of the 50 funda-\\nmental herbs. It is associated with the heart, liver, stom-\\nach, and large intestine.\\nMore specifically, coptis is used to treat such gas-\\ntrointestinal problems as diarrhea, vomiting, and bacte-\\nrial dysentery. It is also used to treat chronic gall bladder\\ninflammations. Other gastrointestinal conditions treated\\nwith coptis include abdominal cramps, acid reflux\\n(heartburn ), ineffective or painful bowel movements,\\nand bloody stools. Coptis is effective as a hemostatic,\\nwhich means that it can be used to stop bleeding.\\nChinese herbalists also use preparations made from\\ncoptis to relieve high fever and delirium. These prepara-\\ntions can be used as a gargle to relieve sore throats. Ex-\\nternally coptis can be used as a mouthwash to treat all\\nkinds of mouth sores, including canker sores, tongue ul-\\ncers, and swollen gums. As an eyewash it is used for\\nconjunctivitis(pink eye). On the skin it is used topically\\nto treat acne, boils, carbuncles, burns, and infected cuts.\\nC. triflora is used in North America in some similar\\nways. In an interesting parallel, some Native American\\ntribes used their native species of coptis as a wash for eye\\nand mouth problems in much the same way as the Chi-\\nnese. It was also used as a gargle for sore throats. Al-\\nthough it is not as popular in North America as in China,\\nmodern North American herbalists use coptis to treat indi-\\ngestion. It is also used externally as a douche to treat vagi-\\nnal infections. The herb is used in similar ways in India.\\nModern scientific research supports many of the tra-\\nditional uses of coptis. All species of this herb contain\\nthe compound berberine, which is a white or yellow\\nwater-soluble alkaloid. Berberine is known to have\\nstrong antibiotic effects. In test tube studies, berberine\\nwas shown to inhibit the growth of streptococcal bacteria\\nresponsible for some forms of pneumonia. This antibac-\\nterial activity supports the use of coptis to treat skin,\\nmouth, eye, and vaginal infections.\\nBerberine also is known to stimulate the production\\nof saliva, gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and bile, sug-\\ngesting that there is a chemical basis for the traditional\\nuse of coptis in treating gastrointestinal disorders.\\nBerberine is also found in such other healing plants as\\ngoldenseal, barberry , and Oregon grape. Preliminary\\ntest tube studies of berberine suggest that it may also be\\neffective against fungal infections , some viruses, and\\ncertain intestinal parasites. The high level of interest in\\nberberine in the research community means that more\\nstudies of coptis may soon be available.\\nPreparations\\nThe rhizomes and roots of coptis are harvested in\\nthe in the autumn and are used either dried or fresh. The\\nherb is available powdered or as a tincture. The dosage\\nvaries according to the condition being treated. The ac-\\ntions of coptis are similar to the actions of goldenseal\\n(Hydrastis canadensis ), and it is sometimes substituted\\nfor goldenseal in herbal remedies.\\nIn Chinese herbalism, coptis is rarely used alone,\\nbut can be found as an ingredient in many formulas.\\nThese include hoelen and polyphorus, leonoris and\\nachyranthes,tang gui and gardenia , and at least half a\\ndozen other formulas.\\nPrecautions\\nBerberine is known to cause contractions of the\\nuterus in laboratory animals. For this reason, it is recom-\\nmended that pregnant women not take coptis or any\\nother herb containing berberine.\\nSide effects\\nNo unwanted side effects have been reported when\\ncoptis is used in the amounts recommended by herbalists.\\nInteractions\\nCoptis is has been used for thousands of years in\\nChina in conjunction with other herbs with no reported\\ninteractions.

It mani-\\nfests as a rough and painful bump. A callus is a rough,\\nthickened lump of dead skin that is usually painless. It\\nmay be found on the feet, the hands, or anywhere else\\nthere is repeated friction and pressure.\\nDescription\\nCorns and calluses affect about 5% of the popula-\\ntion of the United States. Women have corns more often\\nthan men, probably due to wearing ill-fitted shoes more\\noften. Although calluses may form anywhere on the\\nbody, they are generally found on the heels and balls of\\nthe feet, the knees, and the palms of the hands. Calluses\\nare usually larger than corns—they may measure more\\nthan an inch (2.5 cm) wide. Calluses usually only hurt if\\npressure is applied to them.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nCorns and calluses form to prevent injury to skin\\nthat is repeatedly pinched, rubbed, or irritated. Heredi-\\ntary calluses may develop where there is no apparent\\nfriction. This condition runs in families and occurs most\\noften in children.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2546\\nCorns and calluses\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nFungus—A plant that lacks both leaves and flow-\\ners, and lives on decaying matter.

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Reproduced by\\npermission.)\\nThe most common causes of the formation of corns\\nand calluses are:\\n• shoes that have very high heels and shoes that do not fit\\nproperly\\n• tight socks or stockings\\n• deformities of the toes\\n• walking or standing on a hard surface for an extended\\ntime\\n• jobs or hobbies that cause steady or recurring pressure\\non the same spot\\nCorns may be extremely sore and surrounded by in-\\nflamed, swollen skin. A sharp pain will probably occur\\nwhenever downward pressure is applied, and a dull ache\\nmay be felt at other times.\\nDiagnosis\\nCorns can be recognized on sight. They are some-\\ntimes mistaken for warts. However, if the lesion is a\\nwart, it will bleed when scraped with a sharp implement.\\nA callus will not bleed, but will shed a layer of dead\\nskin. This can provide the basis of a general diagnosis.\\nTreatment\\nStanding and walking correctly can sometimes elim-\\ninate excess foot pressure and minimize the development\\nand recurrence of corns and calluses. Bodywork systems\\nsuch as Aston-Patterning, the Feldenkrais method, and\\nrolfing, may help to correct body imbalances that lead to\\ncorns and calluses.\\nTwo or three daily applications of calendula (Cal-\\nendula officinalis ) salve can soften skin and prevent in-\\nflammation. A mixture of one teaspoon of lemon juice,\\none teaspoon of dried chamomile (Martricaria recutita),\\nand one crushed garlic clove (Allium sativa ) can be ap-\\nplied directly to dissolve thickened skin.\\nA recommended Ayurvedic remedy is the nightly ap-\\nplication of a paste made by combining one teaspoon of\\naloevera gel with one half teaspoon of turmeric (Cur-\\ncuma longa). The corn or callus should be covered with\\nthe paste and bandaged overnight. It should be soaked in\\nwarm water for 10 minutes every morning, and given a\\ndaily massage with mustard oil (Brassica cruciferae).\\nAllopathic treatment\\nThe attention of a physician may be required if there\\nis numbness, reduced feeling, or severe pain. Occasion-\\nally, an orthopedist may have to perform surgery to cor-\\nrect toe deformities or remove bits of bone that may be\\ncausing corns or calluses to develop. Medical attention is\\nnot usually required unless diabetes mellitus , poor cir-\\nculation, or other problems make self-care difficult. The\\nfirst step in home care of corns and calluses is to identify\\nand eliminate sources of pressure and friction. Dough-\\nnut-shaped pads, wads of cotton, lamb’s wool, or other\\nkinds of inserts can be used to cushion affected areas.\\nSoaking the feet in a solution of Epsom salts, or using\\nhydrocortisone creams, petroleum jelly, or lanolin lo-\\ntions can soften calluses. After which, they can be re-\\nduced or removed by rubbing the area with a pumice\\nstone. This is not recommended for corns, however, as\\nrubbing just makes them more painful.\\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider\\nif there is broken skin because it may become infected.\\nIn the case of an infection, affected layers of skin need to\\nbe removed, and pus may need to be drained. Oral an-\\ntibiotics may be given to eliminate the infection. Corti-\\nsone may be injected into the affected area to decrease\\npain or inflammation.\\nExpected results\\nMost corns and calluses disappear within three\\nweeks after the pressure that caused them is eliminated.\\nHowever, if the causes of the condition are not remedied\\ncompletely, or are allowed to recur, the corns and callus-\\nes may return. If there is continual pain associated with\\ncorns, it can change the way a person stands or walks.\\nSuch changes may eventually cause pain and dysfunc-\\ntion in the ankles, back, hips, or knees.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 547'),\n",

The stigmas are found on the female flower\\nof corn, a grain that is also known as maize and is a mem-\\nber of the grass family (Gramineae or Poaceae). The stig-\\nmas measure 4–8 in (10–20 cm) long and are collected for\\nmedicinal use before the plant is pollinated. Cornsilk can\\nalso be removed from corn cobs for use as a remedy.\\nIf fertilized, the stigmas dry and become brown.\\nThen yellow corn kernels develop. Corn is native to\\nNorth America and now grows around the world in warm\\nclimates.\\nCornsilk is also known as mother’s hair, Indian corn,\\nmaize jagnog, Turkish corn, yu mi xu, and stigmata maydis.\\nGeneral use\\nSome historians believe that corn has grown for\\nmore than 7,000 years in North America. About the time\\nthat Christopher Columbus brought the first corn to Eu-\\nrope, the grain grew throughout North and South Ameri-\\nca. The venerable plant’s stigmas have long been used in\\nfolk medicine to treat urinary conditions including in-\\nflammation of the bladder and painful urination.\\nCornsilk also served as a remedy for heart trouble,\\njaundice, malaria, and obesity. Cornsilk is rich in vita-\\nmin K, making it useful in controlling bleeding during\\nchildbirth. It has also been used to treat gonorrhea.\\nFor more than a century, cornsilk has been a remedy\\nfor urinary conditions such as acute and inflamed blad-\\nders and painful urination. It was also used to treat the\\nprostate. Some of those uses have continued into modern\\ntimes; cornsilk is a contemporary remedy for all condi-\\ntions of the urinary passage.\\nDrinking cornsilk tea is a remedy to help children\\nstop wetting their beds, a condition known as enuresis. It\\nis also a remedy for urinary conditions experienced by\\nthe elderly.\\nCornsilk is used to treat urinary tract infections and\\nkidney stones in adults. Cornsilk is regarded as a sooth-\\ning diuretic and useful for irritation in the urinary sys-\\ntem. This gives it added importance, since today, physi-\\ncians are more concerned about the increased use of an-\\ntibiotics to treat infections, especially in children. Even-\\ntually, overuse can lead to drug-resistant bacteria. Also,\\nthese drugs can cause complications in children.\\nFurthermore, cornsilk is used in combination with\\nother herbs to treat conditions such as cystitis (inflam-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2548\\nCornsilk\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nBursitis—An inflammation of the tissue sac, called\\na bursa, which surrounds and helps lubricate the\\njoints.\\nOrthopedist—A specialist who is concerned with\\nthe bones, muscles, and joints and their points of\\ninteraction.\\nPumice stone —A volcanic rock that can be used\\nto remove overgrowths and smooth the skin.\\nWart—A small, fleshy skin growth caused by a\\nvirus.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 548'),\n",

The tea is also believed to dimin-\\nish prostate inflammation and the accompanying pain\\nwhen urinating.\\nSince cornsilk is used as a kidney remedy and in the\\nregulation of fluids, the herb is believed to be helpful in\\ntreating high blood pressure and water retention. Corn-\\nsilk is also used as a remedy for edema (the abnormal\\naccumulation of fluids).\\nCornsilk is used to treat urinary conditions in coun-\\ntries including the United Sates, China, Haiti, Turkey,\\nand Trinidad.

The\\nherb used for centuries to treat urinary conditions ac-\\nquired another modern-day use. Cornsilk is among the\\ningredients in a product advertised to help people pass\\ntheir drug tests.\\nPreparations\\nSome herbalists say that cornsilk is best used when\\nfresh, but it is also available in dried form. Cornsilk can\\nbe collected from the female flower or from corn cobs. In\\naddition, cornsilk is available commercially in powdered\\nand capsule form and as an extract. Cornsilk is usually\\nbrewed as a tea, a beverage that is said to be soothing.\\nCornsilk tea or infusion can be made by pouring 1\\ncup (240 ml) of boiling water over 2 tsp (2.5 g) of dried\\ncornsilk. The mixture is covered and steeped for 10–15\\nminutes. The tea should be consumed three times daily.\\nIn addition, a tincture of 1 tsp (3-6 ml) of cornsilk\\ncan be taken three times daily. Tincture can be purchased\\nover the counter, or made at home by mixing the herb\\nwith water or alcohol at a ratio of 1:5 or 1:10.\\nCornsilk is also available in capsule form. The usual\\ndosage for 400-mg capsules is two capsules. These are\\ntaken with meals three times daily.\\nA remedy for bedwetting\\nHerbal remedies can be part of the treatment when\\nchildren wet their beds. Methods of stopping this behav-\\nior include having the child exercise during the day,\\ndrink fewer beverages in the evening, and drink a cup of\\ncornsilk tea one hour before bedtime. Cornsilk could be\\nthe only ingredient in the tea. However, cornsilk can be\\npart of an herbal combination if bedwetting is caused by\\nlack of nervous control of the bladder.\\nCornsilk combinations\\nCornsilk combines well with other herbs to remedy\\na range of urinary conditions. One remedy for a bed-wet-\\nting tea is to combine one part of cornsilk,St. John’s\\nwort, horsetail, wild oat, and lemon balm.\\nAn herbal practitioner can recommend other combi-\\nnation remedies to treat more complicated conditions. For\\nexample, when a person has cystitis, cornsilk can be com-\\nbined with yarrow, buchu, couchgrass, or bearberry.\\nFurthermore, cornsilk may be an ingredient in a\\ncommercial remedy taken to maintain the urinary tract\\nsystem. Other ingredients could include yarrow and\\nmarsh mallow.\\nPrecautions\\nCornsilk is safe when taken in proper dosages, ac-\\ncording to sources including PDR (Physician’s Desk\\nReference) for Herbal Medicines, , the 1998 book based\\non the findings of Germany’s Commission E. The com-\\nmission published its findings about herbal remedies in a\\n1997 monograph.\\nBefore beginning herbal treatment, people should\\nconsult a physician, practitioner, or herbalist.

Odle\\nCornus\\nDescription\\nCornus (Cornus officinalis) is a tree used in Chinese\\nmedicine. Its Chinese name is shan zhu yu . Cornus is\\nshrub that grows to a height of 30 ft (10 m) in the wood-\\nland regions of East Asia from China to Korea. The fruit\\nis used in healing. It is harvested when ripe, then dried\\nfor future use. The small fruits can also be eaten as food,\\neither raw or cooked. They contain about 8.6% sugar and\\nhave a slightly astringent taste. The bark from the stem is\\nalso used as an anti-malarial tonic.\\nChinese cornus should not be confused with the\\nNorth American tree Cornus florida , better known as\\ndogwood or American boxwood. Dogwood and Chinese\\ncornus are in the same plant family but have somewhat\\ndifferent healing properties. The bark of Cornus florida\\nis used in Western herbal healing.\\nGeneral use\\nCornus has been used in China for more than 2,000\\nyears. In the Chinese system of health, yin aspects must\\nbe kept in balance with yang aspects. Ill health occurs\\nwhen the energies and elements of the body are out of\\nbalance or in disharmony. Health is restored by taking\\nherbs and treatments that restore this balance.\\nCornus is strongly associated with the kidneys, the\\nreproductive system, and, to a lesser extent, the liver. It is\\nmade into a slightly warm yin tonic and classified as\\nhaving a sour taste. In Chinese medicine sour herbs are\\nbelieved to help control body fluids and conditions such\\nas bed-wetting, excessive sweating, heavy or prolonged\\nmenstruation, and premature ejaculation.\\nCornus is rarely used alone. It is an ingredient in\\nmany herbal formulas where it is used to stabilize and\\nbind. It has astringent properties that are thought to boost\\nthe power of other herbs. Cornus can be combined with\\nboth yin and yang herbs to remedy deficiencies in either\\narea because it conserves jing, the essence of life. In Chi-\\nnese medicine jing, when referring to a man, means\\nsperm. The ability to conserve jing is a result of the sta-\\nbilizing and binding properties and the ability to control\\nbody fluids.\\nAlthough the results are not completely clear, some\\nstudies have shown that the fruit of cornus has antibacte-\\nrial and antifungal properties. In some studies extracts of\\nthe fruit inhibited the growth of some strains of Staphy-\\nlococcus bacteria. It may also be effective against Salmo-\\nnella and Shigella, both bacteria that cause gastrointesti-\\nnal disturbances.\\nCornus fruit is also used in formulas that strengthen\\nthe back and knees, both areas associated with kidney\\njing. It is also used in formulas that control body fluids\\nand treat excessive sweating, urine leakage, sperm leak-\\nage (spermatorrhea), and heavy, prolonged menstruation.\\nCornus is also an ingredient in formulas that treat ringing\\nof the ears (tinnitus ), poor hearing, dizziness , extreme\\nshock, and a wide range of other conditions. The bark is\\nboiled, and the resulting astringent decoction is used in\\nformulas that treat fevers and as an anti-malarial. Inter-\\nestingly, in Western herbalism the bark of dogwood,\\ncornus’s cousin, is also used against malaria. Cornus is\\nalso used to treat diabetes, arthritis, and impotence.\\nTwo Chinese studies published in 1997 and 1998 in\\nThe American Journal of Chinese Medicine found that\\nextracts of cornus increased the blood flow to the kidney\\nand spleen and increased the motility of human sperm.\\nFew scientific studies have been done on this herb out-\\nside of China.\\nPreparations\\nBoth cornus fruit and bark usually are prepared as a\\ndecoction that can be added to other tonics and healing\\nformulas. They can also be prepared as a tincture. The\\ndosage varies depending on the formula.\\nSome formulas that contain cornus include:\\n• eight immortal long life pill\\n• phellodendron\\n• supreme creation\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2550\\nCornus\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 550'),\n",

A\\nrelated species,Corydalis cava, is used in European herbal-\\nism. Another closely related species, is Corydalis canaden-\\nsis (also called Dicentra canadensis) and known by the\\ncommon name corydalis or turkey corn, is found in North\\nAmerica. There are other species of Corydalis found\\nthroughout the world. Although the names are somewhat\\nconfusing, many are used by herbal therapists in similar\\nways and are included under the umbrella label corydalis.\\nC. yanhusuo is a small herb that grows in mixed sun\\nand shade at the edge of woodlands. It is native to\\nSiberia, northern China, and Japan, but is cultivated in\\nother cool parts of China. C. yanhusuo grows to about 8\\nin (20 cm) in height and has narrow leaves and pink\\nflowers. The rhizome (underground stem) is used in\\nhealing. C. yanhusuo is called yan hu suo in Chinese.\\nSome sources suggest that C. yanhusuo is used inter-\\nchangeably with the related species C. solida , which is\\ncalled by the same Chinese name.\\nC. cava is a perennial that grows in shady forests.

C. yanhusuo is\\nused to relieve pain resulting from almost any cause. It is es-\\npecially used to treat menstrual cramps, chest pains, and ab-\\ndominal pain. Corydalis is also the preferred herb in treating\\npain from traumatic injuries. Some herbalists report that fry-\\ning corydalis in vinegar enhances its ability to ease pain.\\nAlong with its ability to relieve pain, C. yanhusuo is\\nused as a general aid to blood circulation and to promote\\nthe circulation of qi, or vital energy. Some Chinese herbal-\\nists also report using corydalis as a sedative and to lower\\nblood pressure. The herb is frequently found in combina-\\ntion with other plants in Chinese formulas that treat stab-\\nbing pain sensations, painful periods, and the like.\\nIn Western medicine, the various corydalis species\\nare used to treat shaking and involuntary tremors. They\\ncan be used to treat people with Parkinson’s disease .\\nCorydalis is also used as a painkiller; a diuretic; a seda-\\ntive that slows the pulse and depresses the central ner-\\nvous system; and a tonic that invigorates the circulation.\\nOccasionally it is used to treat mild forms of depression.\\nIn fact, the uses of the various corydalis species are sur-\\nprisingly similar around the world.\\nResearch scientists have isolated several potent al-\\nkaloid compounds from corydalis.

There\\nis good evidence from Chinese studies that corydalis is\\neffective in relieving pain and menstrual cramps. Evi-\\ndence for the other uses of corydalis is limited to test\\ntube and animal studies.

It is also\\ngrown in the southern United States, Egypt, and coun-\\ntries along the Mediterranean Sea. The plant was culti-\\nvated to produce cotton fiber for clothing. Cotton root\\nbark, the inner bark, and cotton seeds are all used as\\nherbal remedies. While the seeds also served as a food,\\ncotton root bark has been known for centuries as a “fe-\\nmale medicine.”\\nThe herbal remedy is known as cotton root bark,\\nGossypium herbaceum, and cotton.\\nGeneral use\\nGossypium is the Latin word for cotton-producing\\nplant, and this evergreen shrub has been cultivated for thou-\\nsands of years in India. That form of cultivation was brought\\nto China and Egypt in approximately 500 B.C. Europeans\\nbrought cotton cultivation to the New World in 1774.\\nTraditional uses\\nWhile Gossypium herbaceum was grown to produce\\ncotton fiber, other parts of the plant served as medical\\nremedies and food products. Cotton root bark was used\\nas a folk remedy for numerous female conditions rang-\\ning from nonmenstrual bleeding from the uterus to in-\\nducing labor contractions. While it was used to make\\nchildbirtheasier, cotton root bark was also taken as an\\nabortifacient (to induce miscarriages).\\nCotton root bark was not just a woman’s remedy.\\nChewing on the roots was said to stimulate the sexual or-\\ngans, giving cotton root the reputation of being an aphro-\\ndisiac. The root also had uses not related to reproduction.\\nCotton was also a remedy for conditions including snake\\nbite, dysentery, and fever. Furthermore, cotton seed was\\nonce a food product and a remedy. A seed oil emulsion\\nwas given as an intravenous treatment for people with\\nnutritional deficiencies.\\nSome of cotton root bark’s remedial uses came to\\nNorth America with the Africans enslaved by Europeans.\\nWomen used cotton bark root to stimulate menstrual\\nflow and for help with difficulties during childbirth. Cot-\\nton had a different use when slave owners raped women;\\nthey drank cotton root tea to induce abortions.\\nContemporary uses\\nContemporary uses of cotton root bark cover nearly\\nevery aspect of the female reproductive system. General-\\nly, a tea made from this herb is consumed for such condi-\\ntions as producing a normal menstrual cycle. Numerous\\nother uses are listed in such sources as the PDR (Physi-\\ncian’s Desk Reference) for Herbal Medicines, , the 1998\\nbook based on the findings of Germany’s Commission E.\\nThe European group’s findings about herbal remedies\\nwere published in a 1997 monograph.\\nCotton root bark is used as an aid during childbirth\\nand as a remedy for the absence of menstruation, irreg-\\nular menstruation, and painful menstruation. Pregnant\\nwomen take cotton root bark to increase uterine contrac-\\ntions, to expel the afterbirth, and to help with the secre-\\ntion of milk. Cotton root bark is also taken for difficul-\\nties experienced during menopause.\\nFurthermore, cotton root bark is currently used as a\\nmale contraceptive in China because it’s said to immobi-\\nlize the sperm. Cotton root bark supposedly blocks pro-\\nduction of sperm without affecting a man’s potency. As\\nof June 2000, clinical trials were underway regarding\\nthis use of cotton root bark.\\nIn addition, cotton root bark still has a reputation as an\\naphrodisiac. Evidence of this property of the herb, howev-\\ner, is anecdotal. No clinical research or studies have proved\\nthat cotton root bark stimulates or increases sexual desire.\\nIn addition to the medicinal uses of cotton root, oil\\nfrom cotton seed is currently used in soap and in the pro-\\nduction of margarine, shortening, cooking oil, and salad oil.\\nPreparations\\nWhile cotton root bark was taken as a tea in folk\\nmedicine, other forms of the herb are used in contempo-\\nrary alternative medicine. Cotton root bark is currently\\nused as a liquid extract or a tincture. The dosage for both\\nthe tincture and liquid extract is 0.5–1 tsp (2–4 ml) of ei-\\nther solution. This amount can be divided into two daily\\ndoses; a single dose consists of 20–40 drops (0.25–0.5\\ntsp). The extract or tincture can be added to a small\\namount of water.\\nCotton root bark can be combined with goldenseal\\n(Hydrastis canadensis) in herbal preparations.\\nPrecautions\\nCotton root bark has varied uses, and opinions are var-\\nied about whether this remedy is safe to use. According to\\nthe PDR for Herbal Medicines , cotton root bark is safe\\nwhen taken in therapeutic doses. Other herbalists state that\\nno part of Gossypium herbaceumshould be taken internally\\nwithout first consulting with a doctor or health practitioner.\\nThis precaution is particularly important for pregnant\\nwomen. Although cotton root bark is a remedy for condi-\\ntions related to childbirth, manufacturers of herbal products\\nadvise women to seek medical advice before using it.\\nAlthough health risks have not been reported, poison-\\nings have occurred when animals ate cotton-seed cakes\\nover a long period of time.

Coughing protects the respiratory sys-\\ntem by clearing it of irritants and secretions.\\nDescription\\nWhile people can generally cough on purpose, a\\ncough is usually a reflex triggered when an irritant stimu-\\nlates one or more of the cough receptors found at differ-\\nent points in the respiratory system. These receptors then\\nsend a message to the cough center in the brain, which in\\nturn tells the body to cough. A cough begins with a deep\\nbreath in, at which point the opening between the vocal\\ncords at the upper part of the larynx (glottis) shuts, trap-\\nping the air in the lungs. As the diaphragm and other\\nmuscles involved in breathing press against the lungs, the\\nglottis suddenly opens, producing an explosive outflow of\\nair at speeds greater than 100 mi (160 km) per hour.\\nIn normal situations, most people cough once or\\ntwice an hour during the day to clear the airway of irri-\\ntants. However, when the level of irritants in the air is\\nhigh or when the respiratory system becomes infected,\\ncoughing may become frequent and prolonged. It may in-\\nterfere with exercise or sleep, and it may also cause dis-\\ntress if accompanied by dizziness, chest pain, or breath-\\nlessness. In the majority cases, frequent coughing lasts\\none to two weeks and tapers off as the irritant or infection\\nsubsides. If a cough lasts more than three weeks, it is\\nconsidered a chronic cough, and physicians will try to de-\\ntermine a cause beyond an acute infection or irritant.\\nCoughs are generally described as either dry or pro-\\nductive. A dry cough does not bring up a mixture of\\nmucus, irritants, and other substances from the lungs\\n(sputum), while a productive cough does. In the case of a\\nbacterial infection, the sputum brought up in a productive\\ncough may be greenish, gray, or brown. In the case of an\\nallergy or viral infection it may be clear or white. In the\\nmost serious conditions, the sputum may contain blood.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nIn the majority of cases, coughs are caused by respi-\\nratory infections, including:\\n• colds or influenza, the most common causes of coughs\\n• bronchitis, an inflammation of the mucous membranes\\nof the bronchial tubes\\n• croup, a viral inflammation of the larynx, windpipe,\\nand bronchial passages that produces a bark-like cough\\nin children\\n• whooping cough, a bacterial infection accompanied by\\nthe high-pitched cough for which it is named\\n• pneumonia , a potentially serious bacterial infection\\nthat produces discolored or bloody mucus\\n• tuberculosis , another serious bacterial infection that\\nproduces bloody sputum\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2554\\nCough\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAbortifacient —A drug or substance that induces\\nan abortion.\\nAphrodisiac—A drug or other agent that is reput-\\ned to arouse sexual desire.\\nGossypol —A chemical found in cotton seed oil\\nthat is thought to immobilize sperm.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 554'),\n",

In the case of ciga-\\nrette smokers, the nicotine present in the smoke paralyzes\\nthe hairs (cilia) that regularly flush mucus from the respi-\\nratory system. The mucus then builds up, forcing the\\nbody to removed it by coughing. Post-nasal drip, the irri-\\ntating trickle of mucus from the nasal passages into the\\nthroat caused by allergies or sinusitis, can also result in a\\ncough. Some chronic conditions, such as asthma, chron-\\nic bronchitis, emphysema, and cystic fibrosis, are charac-\\nterized in part by a cough. A condition in which stomach\\nacid backs up into the esophagus (gastroesophageal re-\\nflux) can cause coughing, especially when a person is\\nlying down. A cough can also be a side effect of medica-\\ntions that are administered via an inhaler. It can also be a\\nside effect of beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors, which are\\ndrugs used for treating high blood pressure.\\nDiagnosis\\nTo determine the cause of a cough, a physician\\nshould take an exact medical history and perform an\\nexam. Information regarding the duration of the cough,\\nwhat other symptoms may accompany it, and what envi-\\nronmental factors may influence it aid the doctor in his\\nor her diagnosis. The appearance of the sputum will also\\nhelp determine what type of infection, if any, may be in-\\nvolved. The doctor may even observe the sputum micro-\\nscopically for the presence of bacteria and white blood\\ncells. Chest x rays may help indicate the presence and\\nextent of such infections as pneumonia or tuberculosis. If\\nthese actions are not enough to determine the cause of\\nthe cough, a bronchoscopy or laryngoscopy may be or-\\ndered. These tests use slender tubular instruments to in-\\nspect the interior of the bronchi and larynx.\\nTreatment\\nCoughs due to bacterial or viral upper respiratory\\ninfections may be effectively treated with complemen-\\ntary therapies. The choice of remedy will vary and be\\nspecific to the type of cough the patient has. Lingering\\ncoughs or coughing up blood should be treated by a\\ntrained practitioner.\\nNutrition & diet\\nMany health practitioners advise increasing fluid in-\\ntake and breathing in warm, humidified air as ways of\\nloosening chest congestion. Avoiding mucous-producing\\nfoods can be effective in healing a cough condition.\\nThese mucous-producing foods can vary, based on indi-\\nvidual intolerance, but dairy products are a major mu-\\ncous-producing food for most people. Other foods to\\navoid are sugar and foods high in sodium. Others recom-\\nmend hot tea flavored with honey as a temporary home\\nremedy for coughs caused by colds or flu.\\nVarious vitamins may be helpful in preventing or\\ntreating conditions (including colds and flu) that lead to\\ncoughs. They include vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, vita-\\nmin A, and folic acid.\\nHerbal medicine\\nThere are many Western herbs, as well as herbs used\\nin traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), that soothe the\\nthroat, quiet coughs, and act as expectorants. Some in-\\nclude:\\n• marsh mallow\\n• licorice\\n• aniseed\\n• fritillaria\\n• loquat\\nHomeopathic remedies\\nDepending on the type of cough and its duration,\\nseveral homeopathic remedies include:\\n• Aconite for dry coughs with fever\\n• Antimonium tartaricum for productive coughs\\n• Bryonia for intense, dry coughs accompanied by thirst\\n• Drosera for violent coughing\\n• Rumex crispus for tickling coughs\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatment of a cough generally involves addressing\\nthe condition causing it. An acute infection such as pneu-\\nmonia may require antibiotics, an asthma-induced cough\\nmay be treated with the use of bronchodialators, or an\\nantihistamine may be administered in the case of an al-\\nlergy. Cough medicines may be given if the patient can-\\nnot rest because of the cough or if the cough is not pro-\\nductive, as is the case with most coughs associated with\\ncolds or flu. The two types of drugs used to treat coughs\\nare antitussives and expectorants.\\nExpected results\\nBecause the majority of coughs are related to the\\ncommon cold or influenza, most will end in 7-21 days.\\nThe outcome of coughs due to a more serious underlying\\ndisease depends on the pathology of that disease.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 555\\nCough\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 555'),\n",

It is a common scalp\\nproblem in infants and younger children.\\nDescription\\nCradle cap appears as thick, oily yellowish or brown-\\nish patches on the skin, particularly the scalp. It is also\\noften found around the eyebrows, around the nose, be-\\nhind the ears, and in the genital area. The skin itself often\\nappears to be red, flaky, and irritated underneath the oily\\npatches. It most often effects children who are between\\ntwo weeks and two years old. Although cradle cap may\\nbe unsightly, it is usually not harmful to the child.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nDuring infancy and early childhood, the glands that\\nproduce sweat and oil are in a highly reactive state. Cra-\\ndle cap is most likely due to a buildup of sweat and oil\\nproduced by these overactive glands. This buildup may\\nalso cause an irritation of the skin. Sometimes an over-\\ngrowth of the yeast called Pityrosporum ovale may also\\ncontribute to the condition. Occasionally, cradle cap is a\\nsymptom of more serious problems.\\nDiagnosis\\nCradle cap is easily recognizable, and usually it re-\\nquires no further diagnosis. However, if the rash seems\\nto be very itchy or irritating, it may be necessary to rule\\nout eczema. If there are additional symptoms, a health-\\ncare provider should be consulted for a physical exam\\nand possible testing.\\nTreatment\\nMost remedies for cradle cap can be applied directly\\nto the oily patches on the skin. Tannins, for example, can\\nhelp to slow down oil production, as well as clear away\\nthe cradle cap. Warm caffeinated tea, German chamomile\\ntea (Matricaria recutita), burdock tea (Arctium lappa), or\\ndiluted witch hazel extract (Hamamelis virginiana,) can\\nbe rubbed into the skin with a cloth several times per day.\\nA comfreyrinse can also be used. It should be rubbed\\nonto the affected area with a washcloth. The rinse can be\\nused after shampooing or bathing, or it can be applied to\\ndry skin. This treatment can be given nightly for up to ten\\ndays until the symptoms are gone. The comfrey rinse can\\nbe made by boiling two ounces (about 57 grams) of com-\\nfrey root,Symphytum officinale,in one quart (or one liter)\\nof water. The tea should be simmered for 20 minutes and\\nthen allowed to cool. A batch of the comfrey rinse can be\\nused and stored in the refrigerator for up to four days.\\nA rule of thumb in science is that like dissolves like;\\ntherefore, any type of food grade oil can be used to dis-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2556\\nCradle cap\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAntitussives—Drugs used to suppress coughing.\\nExpectorant—Drug used to thin mucus.\\nGastroesophageal reflux —Condition in which\\nstomach acid backs up into the esophagus.\\nGlottis—The opening between the vocal cords at\\nthe upper part of the larynx.\\nLarynx—A part of the respiratory tract between\\nthe pharynx and the trachea, having walls of carti-\\nlage and muscle, and containing the vocal cords.\\nSputum—The mixture of mucus, irritants, and other\\nsubstances expelled from the lungs by coughing.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 556'),\n",

Burdock is also\\na good general tonic to take to keep the skin healthy.\\nBurdock should be given for at least three weeks for full\\neffect. A tincture of the wild pansy flower,Viola tricolor,\\ncan also be given. Biotin, a B vitamin, works well for\\ncradle cap and can be given at dosages of 10 micrograms\\n(mcg) for age 0-6 months; 15 mcg for age 6-12 months,\\nand 20 mcg for age one to three years.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nGenerally, cradle cap does not need to be treated\\nmedically. If the condition is resistant to treatment or it\\nstarts spreading, however, an over-the-counter dandruff\\nshampoo may be used once per day until the cradle cap\\nhas improved. Shampoos containing coal tar derivatives\\nmay be highly irritating and are not recommended for\\nuse on children under two.\\nA 0.5% or 1% hydrocortisone cream is available\\nover-the-counter and can be applied two or three times\\nper day to stubborn cases of cradle cap.

There may be an underly-\\ning infection caused by the infant’s scratching, which\\ncan introduce bacteria into the skin. Antibiotics may\\nhave to be prescribed. Other symptoms, such as poor\\ngrowth or diarrhea may point to immune system prob-\\nlems requiring medical assessment and treatment.\\nExpected results\\nUsually cradle cap will eventually resolve with no\\naftereffects, even without treatment. However, it can take\\nquite some time to clear. Most home remedies should\\nclear up cradle cap in a few weeks or months.\\nPrevention\\nWashing the hair more often than two or three times\\nper week may dry the skin out, making it more vulnerable\\nto cradle cap, so limited hair washing is recommended.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nFoley, Denise, et al.

This large shrub grows 5-10 ft (1.5-3 m)\\ntall. The flowers, which appear in spring and summer, are\\nlarge (3-5 in [8-13 cm] across), flat-topped clusters of\\nsnow-white florets. The inner florets are very small, com-\\nplete flowers while the florets along the outer edge of the\\ncluster are large and showy but cannot produce fruit. The\\nfruits, which appear in August, are drooping clusters of\\nbright red oval shiny, translucent berries. Cramp bark\\nberries are edible, but have a very bitter taste. The leaves\\nof cramp bark are lobed and turn a rich purple color in the\\nfall. The bark is grayish-brown, faintly cracked length-\\nwise, and has scattered brown-colored warts.

The constituents of cramp bark are\\nvery similar to those of a close relative called black haw\\n(Viburnum prunifolium). Cramp bark and black haw may\\nbe used interchangeably under certain conditions but\\nshould not be considered interchangeable in the strict\\nsense. The constituents of cramp bark include:\\n• acid compounds (acetic, baldrianic, capric, chloro-\\ngenic, cinnamic, citric, malic, ursolic, and valerianic)\\n• amyrins (alpha-amyrin and beta-amyrin)\\n• astragalin\\n• beta-sitosterol\\n• coumarins (scopoletin and scopoline)\\n• elements (aluminum, calcium , chromium , cobalt,\\niron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus, potassi-\\num, selenium, silicon, sodium, tin, and zinc)\\n• esculetin\\n• glucosides (viburnine)\\n• glycosides (quercetin)\\n• hydroquinones (arbutin, methylarbutin, and free hydro-\\nquinone)\\n• myricyl alcohol\\n• paeoniside\\n• pectin\\n• protein\\n• resin\\n• tannins (catechin and epicatechin)\\n• viopudial\\nCramp bark has antispasmodic (relieves muscle\\nspasms), anti-inflammatory (relieves inflammation),\\nnervine (calms and soothes the nerves), hypotensive\\n(lowers blood pressure), astringent (causes local contrac-\\ntion), emmenagogic (induces menstruation ), and seda-\\ntive (reduces activity and excitement) properties. The\\nberries of cramp bark have antiscorbutic (effective against\\nscurvy) properties due to their vitamin C content.\\nGeneral use\\nHistorically, the Native American Meskwaki people\\nused cramp bark to treat cramps and pains located anywhere\\nin the body, whereas the Penobscot people used cramp bark\\nto treat mumpsand swollen glands. Cramp bark was named\\nfor its primary medicinal use—to relieve muscle cramps and\\nother conditions caused by muscle overcontraction.\\nCramp bark is presently used to relieve any overly\\ntense muscle or muscle spasm of the body. This includes\\nthe muscles of the uterus, air passages, intestines, arms,\\nlegs, and back. In addition, it can be used to prevent mus-\\ncle tension and pain. Cramp bark is also used to treat\\nsymptoms that are associated with excess muscle tension,\\nincluding menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea ) caused by\\nuterine muscle contractions, and breathing difficulties as-\\nsociated with asthma. Colic, spastic constipation, irri-\\ntable bowel syndrome , and the physical indications of\\nnervous tension are also treated with cramp bark.\\nCramp bark has also been used to treat hysteria, ner-\\nvous complaints, debility, convulsions, fits, lockjaw,\\nheart palpitation, tension headaches, spasmodic stricture\\n(narrowing of a passage), bladder muscle spasms, high\\nblood pressure, rheumatism, circulatory problems, and\\nheart disease. It is effective in treating cases of arthritis\\nin which joint pain and weakness have led to severe mus-\\ncle contractions. Cramp bark relaxes the muscles, allow-\\ning improvement in blood circulation that can return nor-\\nmal function to the arthritic joints.\\nCramp bark is used to treat excessive blood loss dur-\\ning menstruation and menopause , and to induce men-\\nstruation in women with light or delayed periods. A\\nwoman may treat dysmenorrhea prophylactically (before\\nsymptoms appear) by taking cramp bark the day before\\npainful menstruation is expected.

Since then, the cran-\\nberry plant has been a popular folk remedy for a variety\\nof illnesses, including gout, rheumatism, diarrhea, con-\\nstipation, scurvy, fevers, skin infections and other skin\\nproblems such as eczema. Cranberries are well known as\\na treatment for such women’s health problems as cystitis,\\nand urinary and genital infections.\\nCurrently, there are approximately 150 species of cran-\\nberry. The best known and most popular is the American\\npeeled off in strips carefully in order not to kill the tree.\\nThe bark is chopped up and dried. Cramp bark can be\\nmade into a decoction (a water extract), a tincture (an al-\\ncoholic extract), or a lotion. Liquid preparations of\\ncramp bark have a reddish-brown color, a slight odor,\\nand an astringent taste.\\nThe decoction is prepared by adding 2 tsp of the\\ndried bark to 1 cup water. The mixture is brought to a\\nboil, the heat is reduced, and the decoction is simmered\\ngently for 10–15 minutes.\\nAlthough the recommended doses of the decoction are\\nvariable, it is safe to drink up to three cups daily. The dose\\nof decoction for menstrual pain is 0.5 cup every three hours.\\nTinctures are more concentrated and act faster\\n(within 30 minutes) than teas or decoctions. The tincture\\nmay be taken for long-term conditions caused by muscu-\\nlar tension such as irritable bowel syndrome. Again, the\\nrecommended doses vary somewhat, but up to 8 ml may\\nbe taken three times a day. The suggested dose of tinc-\\nture for irritable bowel syndrome is 0.5 tsp in hot water\\ntwice a day. The suggested dose of tincture for menstrual\\ncramps is 1 tsp in water three times a day.\\nA lotion prepared from cramp bark may be rubbed\\ninto the skin to relieve painful muscles.\\nTo relieve cramping and back pain at night, cramp bark\\nmay be mixed with lobelia (Lobelia inflata). Cramp bark\\nmay also be used with Mexican yam(Dioscorea villosa) for\\nailments of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary systems.\\nPrecautions\\nSome sources state that the berries of cramp bark\\nare toxic and should not be eaten.\\nSide effects\\nCramp bark is safe for both short- and long-term\\nuse. As of June 2000, there were no indications that\\ncramp bark causes any side effects. Pregnant women and\\nwomen who are lactating (breast-feeding), however,\\nshould not use any herbal medicines without first con-\\nsulting a physician.\\nInteractions\\nAs of mid 2000, there were no indications of any in-\\nteractions between cramp bark and any other drug or\\nherbal medicine.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nChevallier, Andrew.

These compounds, which are re-\\nsponsible for the sour taste of cranberries, acidify the\\nurine and prevent kidney stones.\\n• Vitamins and minerals. Cranberries are rich sources of\\nvitamins including vitamin A, carotene, thiamine, ri-\\nboflavin, niacin, and vitamin C . They also contain\\nmany essential minerals such as sodium, potassium ,\\ncalcium, magnesium , phosphorus , copper, sulfur,\\niron, and iodide. These vitamins and minerals are strong\\nantioxidantsthat enable cranberries to help protect the\\nbody against such infections as colds or influenza. Be-\\ncause of their high vitamin C content, cranberries were\\nused in the past to prevent a vitamin C deficiency\\nknown as scurvy.\\n• Fiber. Like many other fruits, cranberries are a good\\nsource of fiber.\\nGeneral use\\nPrevention and treatment of urinary\\ntract infections\\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) are extremely com-\\nmon in women, affecting one of every two females dur-\\ning their lifetime. Men have urinary infections as well,\\nbut less frequently than women. A woman contracts a uri-\\nnary tract infection when bacteria gets into the relatively\\nshort female urethra and moves up to the bladder. Once in\\nthe bladder, the bacteria grow and spread to other parts of\\nthe urinary tract. If left untreated, UTIs can cause serious\\nkidney infectionsthat may require hospitalization. The\\ndisease is relatively easy to treat, but tends to recur.\\nIn the United States, urinary tract infections result in\\nmore than five million medical treatment visits each\\nyear. The most frequently prescribed treatment for uri-\\nnary tract infections is antibiotics. There are also simple\\nself-protective measures that women can take against\\nUTIs. These include:\\n• Drinking a lot of fluid, which increases the amount of\\nurine produced and helps to flush out infectious mi-\\ncroorganisms.\\n• Emptying the bladder immediately after having inter-\\ncourse.\\n• Using oral contraceptives rather than a diaphragm,\\nwhich tends to put pressure on or irritate the urethra.\\n• Drinking cranberry juice as a preventive measure for\\nwomen.\\nAs early as the 1840s, German physicians observed\\nthat cranberry juice prevented urinary tract infections.\\nThis effect was attributed to the cranberry’s high acidity.\\ncranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), because of the size\\nand juiciness of its fruit. It is a member of the Heath (Eri-\\ncaceae) family. Vaccinium macrocarponis a low-lying fruit\\nplant grown commercially in North America. The shrub\\nbears beautiful pink flowers that grow into rounded reddish-\\nblack berries. The berries are harvested early in the fall, and\\nmade into juices, jellies, or relishes. Juice made from cran-\\nberries is a popular, tart fruit drink. The United States\\npresently produces about 98% of the world’s cranberries.\\nScientists have learned that the chemical composi-\\ntion of cranberries includes many substances that pro-\\nmote healing, such as:\\n• Proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins. These bioflave-\\nnoids make up the pigment of the leaves, and produce\\nthe color of the berries. More importantly, proantho-\\ncyanidins are responsible for cranberry’s best-known\\nmedicinal effect, preventing bladder and urinary tract\\ninfections by inhibiting bacterial colonization. They\\nmay also help relieve diarrheal symptoms.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 560'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 577}, page_content='Recent research has confirmed the effectiveness of\\ncranberries in preventing UTIs. Two studies in the mid-\\n1990s, one involving women 65 years or older and the\\nother with younger women between the ages of 18 and\\n45, showed that cranberries are effective in preventing\\nbladder infections. Regardless of age, women can signif-\\nicantly reduce their risk of urinary tract infections by\\nconsuming 10 ounces of cranberry juice daily. Scientists,\\nhowever, have learned that the effectiveness of cranberry\\njuice is not related to its acidity, as was previously be-\\nlieved. Researchers found that the cranberry’s antibacter-\\nial properties come from its proanthocyanidins (or con-\\ndensed tannins). Proanthocyanidins inhibit chia coli bac-\\nteria from attaching to the inside walls of the bladder, al-\\nlowing them to be easily flushed out with urine before\\nthey multiply and cause infections.\\nA careful review of all studies involving the cran-\\nberry’s role in preventing UTIs concluded that cranberry\\njuice or concentrate is beneficial in preventing infections\\nin women, but its benefits have not been proven in chil-\\ndren or males. The reviewers also noted that many\\nwomen did not complete the full one-year study period.\\nPrevention of kidney stones\\nKidney stones are most often caused by high levels\\nof ionized calcium (as in calcium salts) in the urine.\\nCranberries can help prevent this condition because they\\nare rich in quinic acid, which increases the acidity of the\\nurine. As a result, the levels of ionized calcium in the\\nurine are lowered.\\nA person needs to drink 16 ounces of unsweetened\\ncranberry juice (two glasses) daily to effectively prevent\\nkidney stones. Cranberry capsules or powdered concen-\\ntrates are also available. It is important not to consume too\\nmuch cranberry, because very high acidity in the urine ac-\\ntually increases the risk of kidney stones. A person would\\nneed to drink at least one liter of cranberry juice per day\\nfor a prolonged period of time for this to occur.\\nPrevention of colds and influenza\\nA daily glass of cranberry juice is a good source of\\nvitamin C and antioxidants. These nutrients help support\\nthe body’s immune function and prevent cancer as well\\nas such common infections as colds or influenza.\\nOther uses\\nCranberries may serve as a digestive aid. Because of\\ntheir high acidity, they help to digest fatty foods, and to\\nincrease the appetite.\\nSome early laboratory studies suggest that cranber-\\nries may help to prevent gingivitis ( gum disease ) and\\ncoronary (heart) disease. These studies have not yet been\\nconfirmed by clinical research in humans.\\nCranberry has been a folk remedy for diarrhea. Pro-\\nponents of this use suggest that the proanthocyanidins in\\ncranberries, in addition to having antibacterial activity,\\nalso act as astringents. They cause proteins to clump to-\\ngether to form rigid cakes that prevent bacteria from using\\nthe proteins for food. However, the effectiveness of cran-\\nberries in the treatment of diarrhea remains unproven.\\nVarious cranberry preparations have also been used\\nto treat skin disorders such as acne, dermatitis, and pso-\\nriasis; bed-wetting; burns and wounds; and stress and\\ndepression. There is currently insufficient scientific evi-\\ndence to support these uses.\\nA recent study suggests that cranberry juice may in-\\nhibit the formation of dental plaque by preventing bacte-\\nria from collecting (coaggregating) on the tooth film\\nformed by proteins in the saliva. These preliminary find-\\nings await further testing.\\nPreparations\\nThere are many types of cranberry preparations\\navailable, partly because cranberry products are among\\nthe top 10 best sellers in the health food market. They\\ninclude:\\n• Cranberry juice. For prevention of urinary tract infec-\\ntions and kidney stones, recommended products in-\\nclude those containing pure cranberry juice rather than\\nmixtures that are only 25–27% cranberry juice. Four to\\nsix ounces of unadulterated cranberry juice daily is rec-\\nommended for the prevention of UTIs. Some herbalists\\nadvocate the use of cranberry for treatment of mild uri-\\nnary tract infections; dosages of 10–32 oz (0.3–1 kg)\\ndaily have been used. Cranberry juice may not be effec-\\ntive, however, for established infections. It should be\\ntaken only as a complementary measure rather than as\\nan alternative to antibiotics in the treatment of active\\nUTIs. If a woman experiences such symptoms of cysti-\\ntis as chills, fever, fatigue , and burning pain during\\nurination, she should contact her doctor immediately\\nfor antibiotic treatment.\\n• Dried cranberry powder capsules (475–500 mg). Be-\\ncause most commercial cranberry juice contains high\\nlevels of sugar, these capsules may be a better alterna-\\ntive for diabetic patients or dieters. Each capsule equals\\n0.5 ounces of cranberry juice. Nine to 15 capsules daily\\nis the recommended dosage for the prevention of uri-\\nnary tract infections.\\n• Powdered concentrates. These forms of cranberry are\\navailable in different strengths. Women should follow\\nthe dosages recommended by manufacturers.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 561\\nCranberry\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 561'),\n",

Craniosacral work was referred to as\\n“the art of listening.” Bone setters in the Middle Ages\\nalso sensed the subtle movements of the body. They used\\nthese movements to help reset fractures and dislocations\\nand to treat headaches.\\nIn the early 1900s, the research of Dr. William\\nSutherland, an American osteopathic physician, detailed\\nthe movement of the cranium and pelvis. Before his re-\\nsearch it was believed that the cranium was a solid im-\\nmovable mass. Sutherland reported that the skull is actu-\\nally made up of 22 separate and movable bones that are\\nconnected by layers of tissue. He called his work cranial\\nosteopathy. Nephi Cotton, an American chiropractor\\nand contemporary of Sutherland, called this approach\\ncraniology. The graduates of these two disciplines have\\nrefined and enhanced these original approaches and re-\\nnamed their work as sacro-occipital technique, cranial\\nmovement therapy, or craniosacral therapy.\\nDr. John Upledger, an osteopathic physician, and\\nothers at the Department of Biomechanics at Michigan\\nState University, College of Osteopathic Medicine\\nlearned of Sutherland’s research and developed it further.\\nHe researched the clinical observations of various osteo-\\npathic physicians. This research provided the basis for\\nUpledger’s work which he named craniosacral therapy.\\nBenefits\\nAccording to Upledger, craniosacral therapy is ide-\\nally suited for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,\\nheadaches, chronic middle ear infection, pain, and gen-\\neral health maintenance. It is recommended for autism,\\nfibromyalgia , heart disease , osteoarthritis , pneumo-\\nnia, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic sinus infections, and\\ngastroenteritis (inflammation of the lining of the stom-\\nach or small intestine). It is also used with other thera-\\npies to treat chronic fatigue syndrome , back pain, and\\nmenstrual irregularity. In addition, other craniosacral\\npractitioners have reported benefits for eye dysfunction,\\ndyslexia , depression , motor coordination difficulties,\\ntemporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD), hyperac-\\ntivity,colic, asthma in babies, floppy baby syndrome,\\nwhiplash, cerebral palsy, certain birth defects, and other\\ncentral nervous system disorders.\\nDescription\\nCraniosacral therapy addresses the craniosacral sys-\\ntem. This system includes the cranium, spine, and\\nsacrum which are connected by a continuous membrane\\nof connective tissue deep inside the body, called the dura\\nmater. The dura mater also encloses the brain and the\\ncentral nervous system. Sutherland noticed that cerebral\\nspinal fluid rises and falls within the compartment of the\\ndura mata. He called this movement the primary respira-\\ntory impulse; today it is known as the craniosacral\\nrhythm (CSR) or the cranial wave.\\nCraniosacral therapists can most easily feel the CSR\\nin the body by lightly touching the base of the skull or\\nthe sacrum. During a session they feel for disturbances\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 563\\nCraniosacral therapy\\nWilliam Garner Sutherland studied osteopathy\\nunder its founder, Andrew Taylor Still. Dr. Sutherland\\nmade his own important discovery while examining the\\nsutures of cranial bones the skull bones that protect the\\nbrain. What he noticed is that the sutures were designed\\nfor motion. Sutherland termed this motion the Breath of\\nLife. Through his experiments and research he deter-\\nmined that primary respiration was essential to all other\\nphysiological functions.\\nWhen Sutherland developed his techniques for\\ncraniosacral therapy, he wanted it to serve as a vehicle\\nfor listening to the body’s rhythmic motions, and treat\\nthe patterns of inertia, when those motions become\\ncongested. He believed that the stresses—any trauma\\neither physical or emotional—created an imbalance in\\nthe body that needed correction to restore it to full\\nhealth. The therapy is a hands-on method so that the\\ntherapist can feel the subtleties of the patterns of move-\\nment and inertia. Sutherland felt that this was the way\\nto encourage self-healing and restoration of the body’s\\nown mechanisms, taking a holistic approach to creating\\noptimal health.\\nThe Craniosacral Therapy Educational Trust, based\\non Sutherland’s pioneering work is located at 10 Norm-\\nington Close, Leigham Court Road, London SW16 2QS,\\nUnited Kingdom.

A therapist uses very gentle touch to balance\\nthe flow of the CSR. Once the cerebrospinal fluid moves\\nfreely, the body’s natural healing responses can function.\\nA craniosacral session generally lasts 30–90 min-\\nutes. The client remains fully clothed and lays down on a\\nmassage table while the therapist gently assesses the\\nflow of the CSR. Upledger describes several techniques\\nwhich may be used in a craniosacral therapy session. The\\nfirst is energy cyst release. “This technique is a hands-on\\nmethod of releasing foreign or disruptive energies from\\nthe patient’s body. Energy cysts may cause the disruption\\nof the tissues and organs were they are located.” The\\ntherapist feels these cysts in the client’s body and gently\\nreleases the blockage of energy.\\nSutherland first wrote about a second practice called\\ndirection of energy. In this technique the therapist in-\\ntends energy to pass from one of his hands, through the\\npatient, into the other hand.\\nThe third technique is called myofascial release.\\nThis is a manipulative form of bodywork that releases\\ntension in the fascia or connective tissue of the body.\\nThis form of bodywork uses stronger touch.\\nUpledger’s fourth technique is position of release.\\nThis involves following the client’s body into the posi-\\ntions in which an injury occurred and holding it there.\\nWhen the rhythm of the CSR suddenly stops the thera-\\npist knows that the trauma has been released.\\nThe last technique is somatoemotional release. This\\ntechnique was developed by Upledger and is an offshoot\\nof craniosacral therapy. It is used to release the mind and\\nbody of the residual effects of trauma and injury that are\\n“locked in the tissues.”\\nThe cost of a session varies due to the length of time\\nneeded and the qualifications of the therapist. The cost\\nmay be covered by insurance when the therapy is per-\\nformed or prescribed by a licensed health care provider.\\nPrecautions\\nThis gentle approach is extremely safe in most\\ncases. However, craniosacral therapy is not recommend-\\ned in cases of acute systemic infections, recent skull\\nfracture, intracranial hemorrhage or aneurysm, or hernia-\\ntion of the medulla oblongata (brain stem). Craniosacral\\ntherapy does not preclude the use of other medical ap-\\nproaches.\\nSide effects\\nSome people may experience mild discomfort after a\\ntreatment. This may be due to re-experiencing a trauma or\\ninjury or a previously numb area may come back to life\\nand be more sensitive. These side effects are temporary.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nMore than 40 scientific papers have been published\\nthat document the various effects of craniosacral therapy.\\nThere are also 10 authoritative textbooks on this therapy.\\nThe most notable scientific papers include Viola M. Fry-\\nman’s work documenting the successful treatment of\\n1,250 newborn children with birth defects. Edna Lay and\\nStephen Blood showed the effects on TMD, and John\\nWood documented results with psychiatric disorders.\\nThe American Dental Association has found craniosacral\\ntherapy to be an effective adjunct to orthodontic work.\\nHowever, the conventional medical community has not\\nendorsed these techniques.\\nTraining & certification\\nCraniosacral therapy is offered as part of the stan-\\ndard training in osteopathy, chiropractic , and rolfing.\\nMassage therapists, nurses, dentists, physical therapists,\\nand other health care practitioners can receive training\\nthrough a series of workshops and seminars. The Up-\\nledger Institute offers two levels of national certification,\\ninvolving a rigorous three part exam process of written,\\noral, and hands-on testing.

Milne Institute.\\nLinda Chrisman\\nCreatine\\nDescription\\nWith its promises of bigger muscles and improved\\nathletic performance, creatine has generated more inter-\\nest and controversy than almost any other dietary supple-\\nment. It is widely used by body builders and athletes of\\nall levels, from famous baseball sluggers to high school\\njocks. Even without taking supplements, all people have\\na small amount of this protein in their bodies. Some of it\\ncomes from food, especially meat and fish, while the rest\\nis made by the body from amino acids. No one disputes\\nthe fact that creatine plays an important role in convert-\\ning food into energy. The real question is whether taking\\nextra amounts of creatine can make muscles bigger,\\nboost athletic performance, or improve the health of peo-\\nple with muscle or nerve disease.\\nCreatine is considered important because it can\\nincrease the amount of energy available to working\\nmuscles. The protein is used by the body to make a\\nchemical compound called adenosine triphosphate\\n(ATP), the immediate fuel source used by muscles\\nduring short but intense bursts of activity. Through its\\nconversion into phosphocreatine, a related substance,\\ncreatine appears to delay muscle fatigue by re-supply-\\ning muscles with ATP. Because creatine can be stored\\nfor later use by cells, consuming extra amounts of the\\nprotein may create a deeper energy reserve for mus-\\ncles and other tissues. Excess creatine is eliminated by\\nthe kidneys. This means that creatine supplements\\nmay be of little value in people who have sufficient\\nlevels of the protein, since the kidneys automatically\\nremove extra amounts.\\nA significant amount of research is still required to\\ndetermine the long-term effects of taking creatine, proper\\ndosage, and whether age, gender, or the presence of exist-\\ning diseases can affect use of the supplements. However,\\nas of 2002, studies found a lower risk of training-related\\ninjuries in athletes who used the supplement and new\\ntherapeutic uses of the supplement were being tested.\\nGeneral use\\nCreatine supplements are generally used by weight\\nlifters and athletes who wish to optimize their workouts\\nor enhance athletic performance. It is important to distin-\\nguish fact from myth regarding the possible benefits of\\ncreatine. The scientific evidence suggests that creatine\\nmay not have much usefulness as a muscle-enhancing\\nagent, though it does appear to moderately improve per-\\nformance in exercises or sports that require short, repeat-\\ned bursts of high-energy activity. For example, creatine\\nmay provide a slight energy boost to the muscles of a\\nweight lifter during extended repetitions or a basketball\\nplayer who makes yet another drive to the hoop. Howev-\\ner, creatine does not appear to increase aerobic capacity\\nor improve performance in endurance-type activities such\\nas marathon running. Apart from its uses in body building\\nand athletics, creatine may prove beneficial in the treat-\\nment of certain diseases involving the muscles or nerves.\\nIn one study of 16 physical education students, for\\nexample, those who received 20 g a day of creatine for\\nabout a week were more capable of maintaining speed\\nduring a cycling exercise. The students peddled on a sta-\\ntionary bike for six seconds at a stretch, repeating the ex-\\nercise 10 times and taking 30-second breaks between at-\\ntempts. A study of 14 active men, published in the Journal\\nof the American Dietetic Associationin 1997, investigated\\ncreatine supplementation and repetitive, high-intensity re-\\nsistance exercises involving the bench press and jump\\nsquats. The authors reported that taking 25 mg a day of\\ncreatine for one week enhanced muscular performance\\nduring the resistance exercises and also increased body\\nmass. It is not certain if the higher body mass reflected in-\\ncreases in muscle or simply excess water weight, which\\nmay give the impression of bigger muscles.\\nIn addition to individual studies, several articles in\\nmedical journals have reviewed the scientific literature\\nconcerning creatine. According to an article published in\\nthe Journal of the American College of Nutrition in\\n1998, creatine supplements may boost performance dur-\\ning certain physical exercises that require repeated, in-\\ntense efforts and allow only a short interval of rest be-\\ntween attempts. The author noted that using the protein\\nappears to increase body mass in men (though the initial\\nincrease is probably water) and may increase lean body\\nmass when combined with resistance exercises over a\\nlong period of time. A meta-analysis published in the In-\\nternational Journal of Sports Medicine in 1997 dis-\\ncussed the possible benefits of creatine supplements and\\nhow the protein may produce its effects.

Once ATP reserves get low due to exertion, the\\nhigher levels of creatine and phosphocreatine in muscles\\nfacilitate the speedy production of new ATP. The authors\\nconclude that creatine supplements may be useful during\\nrepetitive training exercises and could provide a compet-\\nitive edge in sports that require repeated, explosive\\nbursts of activity such as basketball or soccer.\\nOne of the most thorough and authoritative investi-\\ngations of creatine supplementation was conducted by a\\npanel affiliated with the American College of Sports\\nMedicine (ACSM). This group, which reviewed over 100\\nstudies involving creatine, published some of their find-\\nings in early 2000 in Medicine and Science in Sports and\\nExercise. The panel found that creatine can boost perfor-\\nmance in certain repetition-type exercises that involve\\nbrief but powerful exertion. They noted that creatine does\\nnot appear to make people stronger or improve aerobic\\ncapacity. Creatine can produce weight gain after only a\\nfew days, but this is most likely due to water retention.\\nSince most of the creatine research has been conducted in\\nhealthy young men, there is limited information about\\nhow age or gender may affect use of the protein. The\\npanel pointed out that, while creatine may produce a\\nsmall but significant boost in performance in very specif-\\nic exercises, it usually cannot satisfy the overly high ex-\\npectations of most people who use the supplement.\\nA 2002 European study reported that creatine sup-\\nplements could actually speed rehabilitation for injured\\nathletes. Patients who were immobilized in a leg cast for\\ntwo weeks were given a dietary supplement of creatine\\nbefore immobilization and then daily throughout the re-\\nhabilitation. They showed faster recovery of strength and\\nmuscle mass than subjects not receiving creatine.\\nAside from sports, research also suggests that crea-\\ntine may be helpful in the treatment of certain diseases af-\\nfecting the muscles or nerves, including Huntington’s dis-\\nease,Lou Gehrig’s disease (amyotrophic lateral sclero-\\nsis), and congestive heart failure. Creatine is not consid-\\nered a cure for these diseases, but may help to alleviate\\nsymptoms (such as muscle weakness and fatigue) or pos-\\nsibly extend survival. In one study involving mice, con-\\nducted by researchers from Harvard Medical School and\\nCornell University Medical College, creatine appeared to\\nprovide protection against Lou Gehrig’s disease. The pro-\\ntein worked twice as well as Riluzole, a prescription drug\\napproved by the FDA for treatment of the disease.\\nPreparations\\nDosage of creatine usually consists of a loading\\ndose of 10–30 g a day (divided into several doses) for\\nfour to six days, followed by a maintenance dose of 2–5\\ng a day. It is not clear if the high loading dosage is actu-\\nally necessary. The ACSM panel noted that smaller\\ndosages (3 g a day) achieve the same effects if taken for\\nseveral weeks.\\nEven without taking supplements, most people get\\nabout 1 g of creatine through their diets. Some authori-\\nties believe it is safer for people to avoid creatine supple-\\nments altogether in favor of eating foods that contain the\\nprotein. The best sources of creatine are meat, poultry,\\nand fish. Getting too much dietary creatine is not consid-\\nered a significant risk because only small amounts of the\\nprotein are contained in food.\\nPrecautions\\nCreatine supplements are not known to be harmful\\nwhen taken in recommended dosages, though there are\\nsome precautions to consider. People with kidney dis-\\nease should not use creatine without medical supervi-\\nsion. Due to lack of sufficient medical study, creatine\\nshould be used with caution in children under age 16,\\nwomen who are pregnant or breast-feeding, and people\\nwith liver disease.\\nThe long-term health risks associated with taking\\ncreatine are unknown. Surprisingly, though, use of the\\nsupplement is increasing, even among children and ado-\\nlescents. Some adults have used the drug on a long-term\\nbasis without knowing the effects of long-term use.\\nSide effects\\nA slight weight gain due to water retention is proba-\\nbly the most common side effect. Nausea, cramping, de-\\nhydration, diarrhea, and increased blood pressure have\\nalso been reported.\\nTo avoid possible side effects, do not take creatine\\nimmediately before or during exercise.\\nDrink plenty of fluids (six to eight glasses a day)\\nwhile using creatine in order to prevent dehydration.\\nInteractions\\nTaking creatine with large amounts of carbohydrates\\nmay increase its effectiveness.

The inflammation of Crohn’s disease most\\ncommonly occurs in the last part of the ileum (a section\\nof the small intestine), and often includes the large intes-\\ntine (the colon). However, inflammation may also occur\\nin other areas of the gastrointestinal tract, including the\\nmouth, esophagus, or stomach. Crohn’s disease differs\\nfrom ulcerative colitis, the other major type of IBD, in\\ntwo important ways:\\n• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease may be discontin-\\nuous, meaning that areas of involvement in the intestine\\nmay be separated by normal, unaffected segments of\\nintestine. The affected areas are called “regional enteri-\\ntis,” while the normal areas are called “skip areas.”\\n• The inflammation of Crohn’s disease affects all the lay-\\ners of the intestinal wall, while ulcerative colitis affects\\nonly the lining of the intestine.\\nAlso, ulcerative colitis does not usually involve the\\nsmall intestine; in rare cases it involves the terminal\\nileum (so-called “backwash” ileitis).\\nIn addition to inflammation, Crohn’s disease causes\\nulcerations, or irritated pits, in the intestinal wall. These\\npits occur because the inflammation has made areas of\\ntissue shed away.\\nWhile Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are sim-\\nilar, they are also very different. Although it can be diffi-\\ncult to determine whether a patient has Crohn’s disease\\nor ulcerative colitis, it is important to make every effort\\nto distinguish between these two diseases. Because the\\nlong-term complications of the diseases are different,\\ntreatment will depend on careful diagnosis of the specif-\\nic IBD present.\\nCrohn’s disease may be diagnosed at any age, al-\\nthough most diagnoses are made between the ages of\\n15–35. About 20–40 people out of 10,000 suffer from this\\ndisorder, with men and women having an equal chance of\\nbeing stricken. Caucasians are more frequently affected\\nthan other racial groups, and people of Jewish origin ap-\\npear three to six times more likely to suffer from IBD.\\nIBD runs in families; an IBD patient has a 20% chance of\\nhaving other relatives who are fellow sufferers.\\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic disorder. While the\\nsymptoms can be improved, there is no known cure for\\nthe underlying disease.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nThe cause of Crohn’s disease is unknown.

(Custom Medical Stock Photo. Re-\\nproduced by permission.)\\nAn obstruction is a blockage in the intestine. This\\nobstruction prevents the intestinal contents from passing\\nbeyond the point of the blockage. The intestinal contents\\n“back up,” resulting in constipation , vomiting, and in-\\ntense pain. Although rare in Crohn’s disease (because of\\nthe increased thickness of the intestinal wall due to\\nswelling and scarring), a severe bowel obstruction can\\nresult in an intestinal wall perforation (a hole in the in-\\ntestine). Such a hole in the intestinal wall would allow\\nthe intestinal contents, usually containing bacteria, to\\nenter the abdomen. This complication could result in a\\nsevere, life-threatening infection.\\nAbcess formation is the development of a walled-\\noff pocket of infection. A patient with an abscess will\\nhave bouts of fever, increased abdominal pain, and may\\nhave a lump or mass that can be felt through the wall of\\nthe abdomen.\\nFistula formation is the formation of abnormal chan-\\nnels between tissues. These channels may connect one\\narea of the intestine to another neighboring section of in-\\ntestine. Fistulas may join an area of the intestine to the\\nvagina or bladder, or they may drain an area of the intes-\\ntine through the skin. Abscesses and fistulas commonly\\naffect the area around the anus and rectum (the very last\\nportions of the colon allowing waste to leave the body).\\nThese abnormal connections allow the bacteria that nor-\\nmally live in the intestine to enter other areas of the\\nbody, causing potentially serious infections.\\nPatients suffering from Crohn’s disease also have a\\nsignificant chance of experiencing other disorders. Some\\nof these may relate specifically to the intestinal disease,\\nand others appear to have some relationship to the imbal-\\nanced immune system. The faulty absorption state of the\\nbowel can result in gallstones and kidney stones . In-\\nflamed areas in the abdomen may press on the tube that\\ndrains urine from the kidney to the bladder (the ureter).\\nUreter compression can make urine back up into the kid-\\nney, enlarge the ureter and kidney, and can potentially\\nlead to kidney damage. Patients with Crohn’s disease\\nalso frequently suffer from:\\n• arthritis (inflammation of the joints)\\n• spondylitis (inflammation of the vertebrae, the bones of\\nthe spine)\\n• ulcers of the mouth and skin\\n• painful, red bumps on the skin\\n• inflammation of several eye areas\\n• inflammation of the liver, gallbladder, and/or the chan-\\nnels (ducts) that carry bile between and within the liver,\\ngallbladder, and intestine\\nsulting in the continuing and out-of-control cycle of in-\\nflammation that occurs in Crohn’s disease. Other evi-\\ndence for a disorder of the immune system includes the\\nhigh incidence of other immune disorders that may occur\\nalong with Crohn’s disease.\\nThe first symptoms of Crohn’s disease may include di-\\narrhea, fever, abdominal pain, inability to eat, weight loss,\\nand fatigue. Some patients experience severe pain that\\nmimics appendicitis. It is rare, however, for patients to no-\\ntice blood in their bowel movements. Because Crohn’s dis-\\nease severely limits the ability of the affected intestine to\\nabsorb the nutrients from food, a patient with Crohn’s dis-\\nease can have signs of malnutrition, depending on the\\namount of intestine affected and the duration of the disease.\\nThe combination of severe inflammation, ulceration,\\nand scarring that occurs in Crohn’s disease can result in\\nserious complications, including obstruction,abscess\\nformation, and fistula formation.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 568'),\n",

Blood tests may reveal an increase in certain\\ntypes of white blood cells, an indication that some type\\nof inflammation or infection is occurring in the body.\\nThe blood tests may also reveal anemia and other signs\\nof malnutrition due to malabsorption (low blood protein;\\nvariations in the amount of calcium , potassium , and\\nmagnesium present in the blood; changes in certain\\nmarkers of liver function). Stool samples may be exam-\\nined to make sure that no infectious agent is causing the\\ndiarrhea, and to see if the waste contains blood.\\nA colonoscopy may be performed to view the interi-\\nor of the colon. During colonoscopy, a doctor passes a\\nflexible tube with a tiny, fiber-optic camera device (an en-\\ndoscope) through the rectum and into the colon. The doc-\\ntor can then carefully examine the lining of the intestine\\nfor signs of inflammation and ulceration that might sug-\\ngest Crohn’s disease. A tissue sample (a biopsy) of the in-\\ntestine can also be taken through the endoscope to exam-\\nine under a microscope for evidence of Crohn’s disease.\\nBoth an upper and lower GI (gastrointestinal) x ray\\nseries can be helpful in determining how much of the in-\\ntestine is involved in the disease. In the upper GI (also\\ncalled a small bowel series), the patient drinks a chalky\\nsolution called barium, which acts as a contrast agent to\\nilluminate the gastrointestinal tract on x-ray film. After\\nthe barium is ingested, x rays are taken at specific time\\nintervals as the barium passes through the stomach and\\ninto and through the small intestine. The lower GI series\\nprovides an x-ray study of the large intestine. The patient\\nis given an enema containing barium, and in some cases,\\nair is also pumped into the rectum to provide a clearer\\nview of the large intestine. This is called a double-con-\\ntrast barium enema.\\nTreatment\\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic, often progressive, ill-\\nness. A correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment with\\nanti-inflammatory medications is critical to controlling\\nthe disease.\\nSome Crohn’s patients find that certain foods are\\nhard to digest, including milk, large quantities of fiber,\\nand spicy foods. Dietary adjustments are usually neces-\\nsary to minimize pain, diarrhea, and other symptoms.\\nAcupuncture and guided imagery may be useful\\ntools in treating any pain associated with Crohn’s dis-\\nease. Acupuncture involves the placement of thin needles\\ninto the skin at targeted locations on the body known as\\nacupoints in order to harmonize the energy flow within\\nthe human body. To treat chronic pain, such as that in-\\nvolved with Crohn’s disease, an acupuncturist will fre-\\nquently place the acupuncture needles along what is\\nknown as the large intestine meridian.\\nGuided imagery involves creating a visual mental\\nimage of one’s pain in one’s mind. Once the pain can be\\nvisualized, the patient can adjust the image to make it\\nmore pleasing, and thus, more manageable.\\nSeveral herbal remedies are also available to lessen\\npain symptoms and promote relaxation and healing.\\nThese include peppermint oil, slippery elm (Ulmus\\nrubra), marsh mallow (Althaea oficinalis), and Chinese\\nherbs. However, Crohn’s patients should consult with\\ntheir healthcare professional before taking them. De-\\npending on the preparation and the type of herb, these\\nremedies may aggravate the digestive tract or interact\\nwith any prescription drugs that are being taken to con-\\ntrol the inflammation of Crohn’s disease.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nTreatments for Crohn’s disease try to reduce the un-\\nderlying inflammation, the resulting malabsorption/mal-\\nnutrition, the uncomfortable symptoms of crampy ab-\\ndominal pain and diarrhea, and any possible complica-\\ntions (obstruction, abscesses, and fistulas).\\nInflammation can be treated with a drug called sul-\\nfasalazine. Sulfasalazine is made up of two parts. One\\npart is related to the sulfa antibiotics; the other part is a\\nform of the anti-inflammatory chemical, salicylic acid.\\nSulfasalazine is not well-absorbed from the intestine, so\\nit stays mostly within the intestine, where it is broken\\ndown into its components. It is believed that the sali-\\ncylic acid component actively treats Crohn’s disease by\\nfighting inflammation. Some patients do not respond to\\nsulfasalazine, particularly those with more severe dis-\\nease. These patients require steroid medications (such as\\nprednisone). Steroids, however, must be used carefully\\nto avoid the complications of these drugs, including in-\\ncreased risk of infection and weakening of bones (os-\\nteoporosis)\\nIn 2001, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\napproved use of budesonide capsules for mild and mod-\\nerate cases of Crohn’s disease involving the small and\\nlarge intestines. Although a steroid, the makeup of\\nbudesonide allows the drug to release into the intestines,\\nwhere it can be mostly metabolized.

When pa-\\ntients are suffering from an obstruction, or during peri-\\nods of time when symptoms of the disease are at their\\nworst, they may need to drink specially formulated,\\nhigh-calorie liquid supplements. Those patients who are\\nseverely ill may need to receive their nutrition through a\\nneedle inserted intravenously.\\nA number of medications are available to help de-\\ncrease the cramping and pain associated with Crohn’s\\ndisease. These include loperamide, tincture of opium,\\nand codeine. Some fiber preparations (methylcellulose\\nor psyllium) may be helpful, although some patients do\\nnot tolerate them well.\\nThe first step in treating an obstruction involves gener-\\nal attempts to decrease inflammation with sulfasalazine,\\nsteroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. A patient with a se-\\nvere obstruction will have to stop taking all food and drink\\nby mouth, allowing the bowel to “rest.” Abscesses and\\nother infections will require antibiotics. Surgery may be re-\\nquired to repair an obstruction that does not resolve on its\\nown, to remove an abscess, or to repair a fistula. Such\\nsurgery may involve the removal of a section of the small\\nintestine. In extremely severe cases of Crohn’s disease of\\nthe colon that do not respond to treatment, a patient may\\nneed to have the entire large intestine removed (an opera-\\ntion called a colectomy). In this case, a piece of the remain-\\ning small intestine is pulled through an opening in the ab-\\ndomen. This bit of intestine is fashioned surgically to allow\\na special bag to be placed over it. This bag catches the\\nbody’s waste, which no longer can be passed through the\\nlarge intestine and out of the anus. This opening, which\\nwill remain in place for life, is called an ileostomy. Howev-\\ner, as an alternative to ileostomy, small intestines are now\\noften shaped into substitute rectal pouches, and the patient\\nmay not always need the ileostomy.\\nExpected results\\nCrohn’s disease is a lifelong illness. The severity of\\nthe disease can vary, and a patient can experience peri-\\nods of time when the disease is not active and he or she\\nis symptom free. However, the complications and risks\\nof Crohn’s disease tend to increase over time. Well over\\n60% of all patients with Crohn’s disease will require\\nsurgery, and about half of these patients will require\\nmore than one operation over time. About 5–10% of all\\nCrohn’s patients will die of their disease, primarily due\\nto massive infection.\\nPrevention\\nCrohn’s disease is a chronic, lifelong disorder. How-\\never, a study published in the New England Journal of\\nMedicine in June 2000 reported that methotrexate (a\\nchemotherapy drug) was found to prevent relapse\\nepisodes in a clinical trial of Crohn’s patients. The study\\nalso found that human growth hormone was useful in re-\\nducing symptoms of the disease.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nGlickman, Robert. “Inflammatory Bowel Disease: Ulcerative\\nColitis and Crohn’s Disease.” In Harrison’s Principles of\\nInternal Medicine.

Odle\\nCroup\\nDefinition\\nCroup is a common ailment of early childhood in-\\nvolving inflammation of the larynx, trachea, bronchial\\ntubes, and lungs. The condition is characterized by a\\nharsh, barking cough, wheezing , and difficulty in\\nbreathing.\\nDescription\\nCroup is most likely to be found in children between\\nthe ages of three months to six years. Most incidences\\noccur during the cold weather seasons.\\nSpasmodic croup is usually mild and may be due to\\nbacterial infection or allergies . For the most part, the\\nchild will not have a fever. Viral croup, also called laryn-\\ngotracheobronchitis, is more severe and is often accom-\\npanied by fever. Both types follow a very similar course,\\nwhich depends on the severity of the illness.\\nIn many instances, a child may have had a cold or\\nthe flu just before the onset of croup symptoms. These\\nsymptoms tend to come on very suddenly. It is not un-\\ncommon for a child with croup to waken in the middle of\\nthe night coughing violently and gasping for breath. In\\nfact, the croup symptoms will usually be worse at night\\nand get better during the day.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nDuring the immune system response to an infection\\nor an allergic reaction, the respiratory passages become\\nswollen, and they are congested with mucus and fluid.\\nThey also become more and more irritated. There is a\\ngreat deal of coughing, and the child may become\\nhoarse. The airways are narrowed, and the breathing is\\ndifficult and noisy. This leads to the characteristic symp-\\ntom of stridor, or noisy aspiration, as the child attempts\\nto draw in air through narrowed passages. The constric-\\ntion of these airways is usually accompanied by a high-\\npitched cough, often described as sounding like the bark\\nof a seal.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis of croup is primarily based on a good his-\\ntory taken by the health care provider, including the\\nphysical symptoms of the illness, the presentation of the\\nillness, and its progression. If a physical exam is per-\\nformed, it will probably include listening with a stetho-\\nscope for the breathing sounds which are characteristic\\nof croup. When the symptoms appear to be severe, or the\\nhistory suggests it, x rays may be taken to rule out\\nepiglottitis (infection of the epiglottis) or aspiration of a\\nforeign body, which are emergency situations.\\nTreatment\\nSupportive measures\\nMost treatment can be done at home, using relaxing\\nand supportive measures to relieve symptoms. Steam in-\\nhalation is quite helpful in this respect. A cool-mist hu-\\nmidifier is recommended, as a hot vaporizer is often haz-\\nardous, especially around young children.\\nOne of the best ways to produce a lot of moist air in\\na short time, is to make use of the bathroom shower. The\\nprocedure is to close the bathroom door and turn on the\\ncool water shower faucet full blast. Then the child can\\nbe a held while seated on a chair or the closed commode,\\nbreathing in steam as it fills the room. This can be done\\nfor up to 15 minutes, and often brings instant relief from\\ncongestion.\\nCool air seems to relax and soothe the respiratory\\nsystem. Therefore, taking a car ride with the window\\nrolled will sometimes effect good results in reducing the\\ncoughing associated with croup.\\nThere is a strong possibility of dehydration due to\\nthe illness. Increasing fluid intake as much as possible\\nand insuring plenty of rest will enhance immune func-\\ntioning, helping the body to help itself. In addition,\\nsmokingshould be prohibited within the house.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 571\\nCroup\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 571'),\n",

Practitioners of crystal healing\\nbelieve that crystals, particularly quartz crystals such as\\namethyst or clear quartz, contain energy that enhances heal-\\ning of both body and mind. They believe that crystals can\\nbe “charged” with this healing energy, in a manner similar\\nto the charging of a flashlight battery. The charged crystal\\ncan then be used to alter the energy patterns in the person\\nreceiving treatment. Some crystal healers also say that ar-\\nrowheads and other stones can be used to diagnose illness.\\nOrigins\\nAboriginal, shamanistic cultures throughout the\\nworld, including Native Americans and the Inuit of\\nbreathing. Inhalants have limited effectiveness over time,\\nand care must be taken to avoid undesirable side effects.\\nOxygen may also be administered in more severe cases.\\nCorticosteroids are given to decrease pain and swelling.\\nIf a child is hospitalized for further observation or\\ntreatment, intravenous (IV) fluids may be given to re-\\nduce dehydration. In a few very severe cases, a tube has\\nto be inserted through the nose or mouth (intubation) to\\nkeep the airway passage open for breathing. There is a\\nslight risk of injury to the respiratory system during the\\nintroduction and the removal of the tube.\\nExpected results\\nCroup ordinarily lasts three to seven days. Most\\ncases are mild and gradually improve with care. Some\\nchildren have recurring bouts with croup, but they usual-\\nly outgrow this by seven years of age.\\nIt is important to monitor a child with croup through-\\nout the night. An adult should probably consider sleeping\\nor resting nearby. If the child is having a serious struggle\\nwith breathing, emergency services should be contacted\\nimmediately. This means either calling 911 or making a\\ntrip to the nearest emergency room. Hospital visits are nec-\\nessary in about one to 15% of the reported cases of croup.\\nPrevention\\nCroup is generally the result of an infectious dis-\\nease. Avoiding exposure to others with respiratory infec-\\ntions is the best way to avoid getting croup. Children\\nshould be taught to maintain good hygiene practices\\nsuch as not eating food from the silverware or dishes of\\nothers and washing their hands. Care should be taken\\nwith colds and the flu so that there is no progression to\\nsymptoms of croup.\\nIn general, an adequate intake of vitamins A and C,\\nbioflavonoids, and zinc can help to prevent the respira-\\ntory infections and allergic reactions that lead to croup.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nBunch, Bryan, ed.

Glass or\\nbamboo cups are placed on the skin with suction, which\\nis believed to influence the flow of energy and blood in\\nthe body. Cupping should not be confused with the per-\\ncussive technique in Swedish massage called “cupping”\\nor “clapping.”\\nOrigins\\nCupping was originally called “horn therapy” in an-\\ncient China, but variations of it have been used in\\nTurkey, Greece, France, Italy, and Eastern Europe. Cup-\\nping has a long history of use in acupuncture practice\\nand has been combined with bloodletting, but it is a ther-\\napy in its own right. There are specialist cupping practi-\\ntioners in Japan.\\nBenefits\\nCupping is a safe, non-invasive, and inexpensive\\ntechnique. It is used by practitioners of Chinese medi-\\ncine to treat colds, lung infections, and problems in the\\ninternal organs. It is also used to treat muscle and joint\\npainand spasms, particularly in the back. Cupping can\\nbe used on people for whom the injection of acupuncture\\nneedles poses a problem or risk. Cupping therapy is\\nthought to stimulate blood circulation.\\nDescription\\nPractitioners of traditional Chinese medicine begin\\ntreatment by diagnosing a patient through interviews,\\nclose examinations of the pulse, tongue and other parts\\nof the body, and other methods. TCM strives to balance\\none who is dying. Crystals have been wrapped in a new-\\nborn’s placenta, then given to the child seven years later.\\nGem stones that have been near meteorite fragments,\\nearthquakes, volcanoes, or trees struck by lightening are\\nalso highly valued for healing properties.\\nSome healers believe that healing crystals can be\\nprogrammed with human thoughts. This may be done by\\nplacing a crystal against the forehead, then visualizing a\\ndesired outcome.\\nPrecautions\\nCrystal healing is largely viewed as an enhancement\\nto other therapies. It should not be used exclusively in\\ncases of serious illness.\\nSide effects\\nThere are few, if any, proven side effects to crystal\\nhealing.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nMedical professionals place little credence in crystal\\ntherapy, attributing any observed benefits to placebo ef-\\nfect. Their skepticism stems from a lack of scientific evi-\\ndence for the healing effects of crystals, and from differ-\\nences of opinion among practitioners about how the ther-\\napy actually works.\\nTraining & certification\\nPractitioners of crystal healing tend to be New Age\\nspiritual healers. A number of schools in Europe and\\nNorth America offer courses in crystal therapy, but the\\nfield is largely unregulated. Many individuals use crys-\\ntals for self-healing.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 575\\nCupping\\nKEY TERMS\\n . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\\nAura—A person’s vital energy field; the energies\\nare said to be seen as colors and represent states\\nof being.

Ac-\\ncording to traditional Chinese medicine, illness is caused\\nwhen qi does not move properly in the body. Acupunc-\\nturists are trained to determine where qi is stagnated,\\nweak, or out of balance.\\nAcupuncturists use cupping for specific problems in\\nthe flow of qi. Cupping disperses and moves qi by exert-\\ning suction and pressure. Cupping is used when the qi is\\nblocked at certain points, or when qi needs to be drawn\\nto the surface of the body from deep within. For in-\\nstance, cupping is used to treat lung infections and colds,\\nbecause it is believed that the suction disperses and ener-\\ngizes the qi that has become blocked and stagnated in the\\nlungs. Cups can also pull out “wind-cold” that in Chi-\\nnese medicine is believed to cause lung infections.\\nPatients usually lie down for a cupping treatment.\\nCups are made of bamboo or strong glass.

The ancient native cultures be-\\nlieved that a delicate balance existed between health, na-\\nture, and religion. Illness occurred when one of these\\nareas was out of balance.\\nThe use of nature’s resources was very important to\\nthe native cultures. In the fifteenth century, the Huaxtepec\\ngarden was developed by the Aztec leader Montezuma I.\\nThis garden was a collection of several thousand medici-\\nnal plants. The Aztec priests used this garden to perform\\nresearch on the medicinal properties of the plants.\\nWhen the Spanish conquistadors came to Mexico in\\nthe sixteenth century, they destroyed the garden and all\\nof the priests’ research because the Catholic Church con-\\nsidered these “sciences” to be blasphemous. Although\\nthe written knowledge was destroyed, the plant wisdom\\nwas remembered, passed down by the native peoples,\\nand became an integral part of curanderismo.\\nThe Spanish missionaries who were sent to the New\\nWorld introduced the native peoples to the Catholic reli-\\ngion and European healing philosophies. Prayers to\\nCatholic saints were soon integrated into healing rituals.\\nAnother doctrine that was passed on to the native peo-\\nples by the Europeans was their belief in witchcraft, sor-\\ncery, and other superstitions, and the philosophy that ill-\\nness is often caused by supernatural forces.\\nAs the native and Spanish cultures intermingled\\nover the centuries, a new culture was formed, as was the\\nfolk medicine of curanderismo.\\nBenefits\\nCuranderismo is used to treat ailments arising from\\nphysical, psychological, spiritual, or social conditions.\\nIllness is said to be caused by either natural or supernat-\\nural forces.\\nNaturally caused illness is treated with herbal medi-\\ncine, massage, and prayer. Much of this illness is thought\\nto be brought about by intense emotions caused by trau-\\nma or a specific event. Susto, for example, is an illness\\nthat is caused by fright. A startling event such as a fire,\\nearthquake, dog attack, car accident, or death may cause\\nthe patient to become ill. Symptoms of susto are insom-\\nnia, diarrhea , extreme nervousness, sadness, depres-\\nsion, loss of appetite, loss of brilliance in the eyes, and\\nlack of dreams.

This type of folk medicine has character-\\nistics specific to the area where it is practiced\\n(Guatemala, Nicaragua, Honduras, Argentina, Mexico,\\nthe southwestern region of the United States, etc.). Cu-\\nranderismo blends religious beliefs, faith, and prayer\\nwith the use of herbs, massage, and other traditional\\nmethods of healing. Curanderismo can be defined as a\\nset of traditional beliefs, rituals, and practices that ad-\\ndress the physical, spiritual, psychological, and social\\nneeds of the people who use it.\\nThe Spanish verb curar means to heal. Therefore,\\ncuranderismo is translated as a system of healing. The\\ngoal of curanderismo is to create a balance between the\\npatient and his or her environment, thereby sustaining\\nhealth.\\nThe healer who practices curanderismo is referred to\\nas a curandero (male healer) or curandera (female heal-\\ner).

Empacho is a blocked intestine disease where\\nthe intestines are plugged by something indigestible such\\nas chewing gum or unbaked dough. To treat this condition,\\nthe curandera performs a massage in which she pulls on\\nthe skin of the back just above the coccyx (tailbone). When\\nthe skin makes a snapping noise the food has been loos-\\nened. Herbal tea is also given to complement the massage.\\nColic is caused by excessive coldness of the stom-\\nach, and mint is used for such digestive problems.\\nSupernaturally caused illnesses or conditions are ini-\\ntiated by witchcraft, sorcery, or hexes. Physical symptoms\\nmight manifest as nervous breakdowns, paranoia,schizo-\\nphrenia, depression, or excessive worrying. Supernatural\\nforces can also create social problems. A person who has a\\nstreak of continued bad luck, or who suffers from marital\\nproblems, the loss of a job, or car troubles will deem the\\nproblem to be caused by a supernatural force. To heal\\nthese ailments and remove the hex or problem, the curan-\\ndera uses rituals, spiritual cleansings, herbs, and prayer.\\nDescription\\nPrayer is the foundation of curanderismo. Curan-\\nderas have strong religious faith and believe that they\\nwere given the ability to heal as a gift from God. Curan-\\nderas pray to spirits and/or Catholic saints for help in\\nhealing their patients, often praying to specific saints for\\nparticular conditions.\\nA traditional healing session may include one or\\nmore of the following: spiritual cleansing (limpia), ritual,\\nmassage, and/or herbal therapy.

Each ob-\\nject has a specific purpose.\\nHoly water is used for protection from negativity or\\nevil spirits. Eggs and lemons are patted on the patient’s\\nbody to absorb negative energies. Rosemary, basil, and\\nrue branches are brushed on the body to remove negativity.\\nCandles are burned to absorb negative energy and\\ncreate a healing environment.

It parasitizes wild and cultivated plants, and is es-\\npecially destructive to such commercially valuable crops\\nas flax,alfalfa , beans, and potatoes. It also grows on\\nsuch common ornamentals as English ivy, petunias,\\ndahlias, and chrysanthemums. For medicinal purposes,\\nherbalists prefer C. epithymum that grows on thyme.\\nCuscuta is a leafless plant with branching stems\\nranging in thickness from thread-like filaments to heavy\\ncords. The seeds germinate like other seeds. The stems\\nbegin to grow and attach themselves to nearby host\\nplants. Once they are firmly attached to a host, the cus-\\ncuta root withers away. The mature plant lives its entire\\nlife without attachment to the ground. The stems of cus-\\ncuta are used in Western herbalism and the seeds are\\nused in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).\\nGeneral use\\nDespite the fact that cuscuta is unpopular with farm-\\ners, it has a long history of folk use. In Western herbal-\\nism, cuscuta was traditionally used to treat liver, spleen,\\nand gallbladder disorders such as jaundice; and to sup-\\nport liver function. It is still used, although rarely, in that\\nway by modern herbalists. It is also a mild laxative.\\nOther traditional Western claims for cuscuta are that it is\\na mild diuretic, and that it can be used to treat sciatica\\nand scurvy. Externally, it can be gathered fresh and ap-\\nplied to the skin to treat scrofuladerma. Extracts of the\\nherb have a very bitter taste.\\nIn traditional Chinese medicine, the seeds of cuscuta,\\ncalled tu si zi, have been used for thousands of years. In\\nthe Chinese understanding of health,yin aspects inside the\\nperson and outside in the environment must be kept in bal-\\nance with yang aspects. Ill health occurs when the ener-\\ngies and elements of the body are out of balance or in\\ndisharmony with nature. Health is restored by taking herbs\\nand treatments that restore internal and external balance.\\nAccording to traditional Chinese healers, cuscuta\\nseeds have a neutral nature and a pungent, sweet taste.\\nThey are associated with the liver and kidneys and are\\nused in formulas that help both yin and yang deficien-\\ncies, depending on the patient’s condition and the other\\nherbs in the formula. Cuscuta was considered both an\\naphrodisiac and a longevity herb because it slowed down\\nthe loss of fluids from the body.\\nContemporary Chinese herbalists use cuscuta in for-\\nmulas to treat a range of conditions, including:\\n• impotence\\n• premature ejaculation\\n• sperm leakage\\n• frequent urination\\n• ringing in the ears\\n• lower back pain\\n• sore knees\\n• white discharge from the vagina (leucorrhea)\\n• dry eyes\\n• blurred vision\\n• tired eyes\\nCuscuta is one of nine herbs included in the manu-\\nfacture of Equiguard, a Chinese herbal medicine recom-\\nmended for kidney and prostate disorders. Research per-\\nformed at New York Medical College indicates that the\\ncombination of ingredients in Equiguard may well be ef-\\nfective in the treatment of prostate cancer. The prepara-\\ntion inhibited the growth of cancer cells, increased the\\nrate of self-destruction (apoptosis) of cancer cells, and\\nprevented the surviving cells from forming colonies.\\nCuscuta is also used in the Indian system of Ayur-\\nvedic healing to treat jaundice, muscle pain, coughs, and\\nproblems with urination.\\nLittle scientific research has been done in the West\\non cuscuta. A purgative compound has been isolated\\nfrom the herb, however, that supports its traditional use\\nas a liver and gallbladder tonic. Other research done at\\nAsian universities indicates that cuscuta seeds contain a\\ncomplex carbohydrate that stimulates the immune sys-\\ntem and has some antioxidant properties as well.\\nPreparations\\nIn Western herbalism, the entire thread-like stems of\\ncuscuta are used. They are boiled in water along with\\nsuch herbs as ginger and allspice to make a decoction. In\\nChinese herbalism, only the seeds are used. They are al-\\nmost always used in combination with other herbs, as in\\nconcha marguerita and ligastrum formulas.\\nPrecautions\\nNo special precautions are necessary when cuscuta\\nis used in the doses normally prescribed by herbalists.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects have been reported when cuscuta is\\nused in doses prescribed by herbalists.\\nInteractions\\nCuscuta has been used for centuries with other Chi-\\nnese herbs without any reported interactions.

Most cuts and\\nscratches are relatively minor and respond well to home\\nremedies. Deep cuts may require medical help and re-\\npairing the skin with stitches to heal properly.\\nCauses & symptoms\\nA cut or scratch is often due to an accidental injury\\nor intentional violence. Age-related changes may be a\\ncontributing factor, because the skin becomes more thin\\nand fragile with age, and thus, more susceptible to cuts\\nand scratches. Infection is a primary concern in dealing\\nwith cuts and scratches. Signs of infection include red-\\nness, pain or tenderness, local swelling, warmth, a dis-\\ncharge from the wound site,fever, swollen lymph nodes,\\nand red streaks spreading out from the wound site.\\nDiagnosis\\nMinor cuts and scratches do not usually require di-\\nagnosis. However, if an infection sets in, the wound may\\nneed to be assessed by a healthcare provider taking a his-\\ntory of the injury and performing a physical exam.\\nTreatment\\nHomeopathic topical preparations can be useful in\\ntreating cuts and scratches. Calendulaand Hypericum\\nperforatum are herbs that can be applied topically as a\\ncream, gel, or ointment. Hypericum 30c can be taken in-\\nternally, as well. It is particularly indicated if the cut is\\nvery painful. Staphysagria 30c is indicated for deep cuts\\nand stab wounds. Aconite 30c may be given every 30\\nminutes for up to three to five doses if a person is very\\nanxious as well as injured.\\nAyurvedic medicine recommends several simple\\napplications for minor cuts and scratches. These include\\nfresh aloe vera gel, plain ghee, and coconut oil.

Echinacea\\nspp. tincture can also be used as a disinfectant or antimi-\\ncrobial to the affected site. The alcohol in the tincture\\nmay cause the wound to sting. Topical applications\\nshould not be used on a deep wound until some initial\\nhealing has occurred.\\nAccording to aromatherapy, a spray of diluted es-\\nsential oils can be used as an antiseptic. They may also\\nrepair skin damage and encourage new cell growth. Tea\\ntree,lavender, myrrh, benzoin, bergamot, chamomile,\\ntea tree, eucalyptus , juniper , rosemary , helichrysum,\\neucalyptus, rose geranium, and sandalwood are all ap-\\npropriate to use on cuts and scratches. About 10 drops of\\nthe full-strength oil should be added, singularly or blend-\\ned, to two ounces of distilled water and one half ounce\\nof goldenseal tincture or alcohol. The essential oil mix-\\nture should be shaken well before each use, and it can\\nthen be sprayed on two or three times per day.\\nVitamins E and A are necessary for the skin to heal\\nwell and quickly. These vitamin oils can be squeezed direct-\\nly from their capsules onto the affected areas several times\\nper day. They can be taken orally, as well, along with a mul-\\ntivitamin containing vitamins A, C, E, and B complex.\\nHealing following an injury is also speeded up by supple-\\nmentation with the amino acids arginine and glycine.\\nBromelain, the digestive enzyme from pineapple, can be\\ntaken between meals as needed to reduce inflammation.\\nAllopathic treatment\\nMost cuts and scratches are minor and can be han-\\ndled at home. A physician should be consulted if:\\n• The cut is very large or deep.\\n• There is uncontrolled bleeding.\\n• There is damage to muscles, nerves, or other deep tis-\\nsues.\\n• The wound edges are very jagged or do not seem to\\njoin together for healing.\\n• The wound site is very dirty or contains difficult-to-re-\\nmove foreign material, such as gravel.\\n• There is weakness or numbness below the injury.\\n• The cut is on the face, chest, fingers, genitals, back,\\nstomach, palm of the hand, or over a joint.\\n• There are signs of infection.\\n• The lymph nodes become swollen.\\n• The injured person has a history of diabetes, poor cir-\\nculation, mitral valve prolapse, an artificial heart valve,\\nor an artificial hip.\\nA cut or scratch should be washed with a mild soap\\nand water. Tweezers that have been disinfected by wash-\\ning in hot, soapy water and soaking in rubbing alcohol\\ncan be used to remove any dirt, glass, or gravel remaining\\nin the wound. Pressure can be applied directly to wound\\nwith clean gauze pad until bleeding has stopped. The\\nwound can be protected while it heals by covering it with\\nan adhesive bandage. The use of an antibiotic or antisep-\\ntic ointment is optional. The use of rubbing alcohol and\\nhydrogen peroxide are not recommended for minor cuts\\nand scratches, as they can cause irritation of the wound.\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 581'),\n",

If there is a lot of\\nbleeding, however, aspirin and NSAIDs should be avoid-\\ned because they may interfere with blood clotting. Keep-\\ning the edges of the wound together can help keep dirt\\nout, speeds healing, and decreases scarring. Stitches are\\nhelpful in this regard, but they, too, can cause scarring.\\nButterfly bandages or steri-strips may also be used to\\nkeep the wound closed. If a cut is more than 0.5 in (1.25\\ncm) deep, stitches will usually be needed.\\nExpected results\\nMost cuts and scratches are superficial, and heal\\nwithin a few days.

The physiological effects of different\\ntypes of music on blood pressure and other bodily indi-\\ncators were first noticed during the late 1800s. The term\\n“cymatics” was coined by Hans Jenny, a Swiss scientist\\nwho derived it from the Greek word kyma (a great wave).\\nJenny published a book about the structure, dynamics,\\nand effects of sound vibrations in 1967. Present-day cy-\\nmatic therapy was largely developed by Sir Peter Guy\\nManners, an English medical doctor and osteopath, start-\\ning in the 1960s.\\nBenefits\\nPractitioners of cymatic therapy believe that sound\\nis capable of rearranging the structure of molecules, and\\ntherefore has unlimited potential as a tool for healing.\\nThey claim to have successfully treated otherwise incur-\\nable and terminal diseases.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Data/GaleMedAC.pdf', 'page': 599}, page_content='Description\\nSound consists of mechanical vibrations that travel\\nthrough a medium such as air, water, or in the case of cy-\\nmatic therapy, the body. Sound healers believe that all\\nparts of the body vibrate and therefore produce sound,\\neither at a healthy, “harmonious” frequency, or at an in-\\nharmonious, unhealthy frequency. Using a computerized\\ninstrument, cymatic therapists direct healing frequencies\\ninto the body to restore resonance and harmony. The\\nhealing frequencies are related to those emitted by a\\nhealthy organ or body part. In this way, cymatic healers\\nsay, the immune system and other natural regulatory\\nfunctions are stimulated. Frequencies may be applied di-\\nrectly, or transmitted along acupuncture meridians.\\nCymatic therapy does not directly heal, practitioners\\nsay. Rather, it creates a near-optimal environment for or-\\ngans or cells. In such an environment, they say, the body\\ncan heal itself without drugs or surgical intervention.\\nThe instrument produces as many as 800 controlled au-\\ndible frequencies. The therapy may also be delivered\\nwithout such equipment, with the use of instruments\\nsuch as tuning forks.\\nPrecautions\\nPatients with cardiac pacemakers are advised to\\navoid this therapy. Because of the controversial nature of\\ncymatic treatment, a medical doctor should be consulted\\nin all cases of serious illness.\\nSide effects\\nCymatic therapy is thought to be generally free of\\nadverse side effects.\\nResearch & general acceptance\\nThe variability with which different body tissues ab-\\nsorb and reflect sound is universally acknowledged. It is\\nthis variability that makes ultrasound scanning a useful\\nform of medical imaging. However, few physicians are\\nconvinced that healing can be facilitated by “tuning” a\\nsound device to a patient’s cellular vibrations. Hence,\\nmedical doctors tend to be highly skeptical about cymat-\\nic therapy.\\nTraining & certification\\nCymatic devices are used by a variety of alternative\\npractitioners, including osteopaths, acupuncturists, and\\nchiropractors. Specific training is needed to operate the\\nmachines. This can be obtained through books, tapes,\\nseminars, and correspondence courses. In most jurisdic-\\ntions, the field is unregulated and patients must therefore\\ntake care to ensure the competence of their healer.\\nResources\\nORGANIZATIONS\\nBrentforton Scientific and Medical Trust.

Perhaps the best known\\nmember of this family is the reed, which ancient Egyp-\\ntians used to make papyrus. However, many other mem-\\nbers of this family have proved useful as food and medi-\\ncine. Cyperus articulatus and Cyperus rotundus are the\\ntwo species most often associated with healing.\\nC. articulatus, also called adrue or Guinea rush, is a\\ntall sedge that mainly grows in Jamaica, Turkey, and\\nalong the Nile River in Egypt. The medicinal part of the\\nplant is its root or tuber. This part is blackish in color and\\nshaped like a top. Tubers are usually about 0.7-1 in (1.1-\\n2.5 cm) long and about 0.5-0.7 in (1.3-1.7 cm) in diame-\\nter. The tubers may be connected in groups of two or\\nthree by underground stems. They are harvested and\\ndried for healing. The herb is bitter in taste and aromatic,\\nsimilar to lavender.\\nC. rotundus is used primarily in Asia and Africa but\\nalso grows in Australia, Europe, and North America. It\\ngrows in low, damp places near water. Like C. articula-\\ntus, the tuber is the part of the plant used in healing. Its\\nChinese name is xiang fu and it has been used in tradi-\\ntional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. C. ro-\\ntundus is also called tiririca, nutsedge, nut grass, musta,\\nmutha, and a host of other local names.\\nGeneral use\\nC. articulatus is used mainly for digestive disorders.\\nIt is an antiemetic, meaning that it suppresses vomiting.\\nThis is useful in reducing the symptoms of morning\\nsickness during pregnancy. Because it gives the body a\\ngeneral feeling of warmth, C. articulatus is sometimes\\nused as a sedative, generally in connection with sup-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE 2 583\\nCyperus\\nGEAM - A to C  10/11/04 3:29 PM  Page 583'),\n",

In the Peruvian Amazon, na-\\ntive people use the herb to treat infection and in Africa it\\nis used to treat epilepsy.\\nThere are few scientific studies of C. articulatus. An\\nArgentinian study conducted in 1995 looked at the bacte-\\nria-killing properties of the herb. It concluded that decoc-\\ntions of C. articulatus completely inhibited the growth of\\none species of Staphylococcus bacteria and partially in-\\nhibited the growth in one species of Pseudominas bacte-\\nria. Both of these bacteria strains are capable of causing\\nsevere, and sometimes fatal,infections. It was ineffective\\nagainst five other infection-causing organisms tested.\\nAnother study published in the Journal of Ethno-\\npharmacologyin 1996 by Swiss investigators found that ex-\\ntracts of C. articulatusreduced certain types of spontaneous\\nneuron firings in the brains of rats. These scientists suggest-\\ned that this suppression might be the basis for C. articula-\\ntus’seffectiveness in treating headacheand epilepsy.\\nC. rotundusis used in Chinese medicine and Japanese\\nKampo formulations. It is rarely used alone and can be\\nfound in formulas that relieve pain, especially pain associ-\\nated with menstruation. It is also used in formulas for\\nstomachache and diarrhea, to improve menstrual function,\\nto treat impotenceor heighten sexual potency, to treat bac-\\nterial infections, dry or tired eyes, and in tonics for general\\nwellness. In other Asian and African countries,C. rotundus\\nis also used as a diuretic and to treat high blood pressure. It\\nis also spread on the skin as a bactericide and a fungicide\\nto prevent infection of wounds, but these properties have\\nnot been studied extensively in the laboratory. In two stud-\\nies, one done in Thailand and the other in Tanzania, com-\\npounds found in extracts from the root of C. rotunduswere\\nisolated and several were found to have antimalarial prop-\\nerties. A recent Japanese study indicates that cyperus ex-\\ntract acts as an anticoagulant by preventing blood platelets\\nfrom clumping together to form clots.\\nA recent Egyptian study of cyperus lends some sup-\\nport to the traditional Chinese use of the herb as a reme-\\ndy for menstrual disorders. The Egyptian researchers\\nfound that cyperus extract has a moderate level of estro-\\ngenic activity.\\nPreparations\\nC. articulatusis usually prepared as a decoction or liq-\\nuid extract to be taken internally. C. rotundus may be pre-\\npared two different ways. It can be boiled to make a liquid\\nto be mixed with other herbs. The tubers can also be ground\\ninto a paste with or without other herbs. The paste can ei-\\nther be formed into pills to be taken internally or applied ex-\\nternally to wounds or skin rashes. This paste is also some-\\ntimes applied directly to the temples to treat headaches.\\nPrecautions\\nNo particular precautions have been reported as\\nbeing necessary in using cyperus.\\nSide effects\\nNo side effects have been reported in using cyperus.\\nHowever, this herb has a long tradition of folk use, but\\nits effects on humans have not been studied in any struc-\\ntured way.\\nInteractions\\nCyperus is often used in conjunction with other herbs\\nin Chinese formulations with no reported interactions.\\nCyperus is, however, reported to be mixed with hallucino-\\ngenic plants by certain tribes living in the Brazilian rain for-\\nest, in order to prolong the action of the hallucinogens. As\\nof 2002, there are no studies of interactions between cyper-\\nus and standard Western pharmaceuticals. A recent Korean\\nreport on several new compounds isolated from cyperus,\\nhowever, indicates that it inhibits the action of benzodi-\\nazepine tranquilizers and modifies the effectiveness of sev-\\neral neurotransmitters in the central nervous system.\\nResources\\nBOOKS\\nMolony, David.

It is the result of the body’s in-\\nflammatory response to a foreign body or a bacterial,\\nviral, parasitic, or fungal infection. An abscess usually\\ndries out and resolves when it is drained of pus. The\\nmost common parts of the body affected by abscesses\\nare the face, armpits, arms and legs, rectum, sebaceous\\nglands (oil glands), and the breast during lactation.\\nDescription\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means they are the\\nresult of an infection. Abscesses occur when white blood\\ncells (WBCs) gather in response to an infection. They pro-\\nduce oxidants (for example, superoxide radical) and en-\\nzymes to digest the invading bacteria, viruses, parasites, or\\nfungi.

To understand the ideas behind acupuncture, it is\\nworthwhile to introduce some of these basic terms.\\nYIN AND YANG. According to Chinese philosophy,\\nthe universe and the body can be described by two sepa-\\nrate but complementary principles, that of yin and yang.\\nFor example, in temperature, yin is cold and yang is hot.\\nIn gender, yin is female and yang is male. In activity, yin\\nis passive and yang is active. In light, yin is dark and\\nyang is bright; in direction yin is inward and downward\\nand yang is outward and up, and so on. Nothing is ever'),\n",

The goal of Chinese medi-\\ncine is not to eliminate either yin or yang, but to allow\\nthe two to balance each other and exist harmoniously to-\\ngether. For instance, if a person suffers from symptoms\\nof high blood pressure, the Chinese system would say\\nthat the heart organ might have too much yang, and\\nwould recommend methods either to reduce the yang or\\nto increase the yin of the heart, depending on the other\\nsymptoms and organs in the body. Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or in-\\ncrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI. Another fundamental concept of Chinese medi-\\ncine is that of chi (pronounced chee, also spelled qi). Chi\\nis the fundamental life energy of the universe. It is invisi-\\nble and is found in the environment in the air, water, food'),\n",

The level and quality\\nof a person’s chi also depends on the state of physical,\\nmental and emotional balance. Chi travels through the\\nbody along channels called meridians.\\nTHE ORGAN SYSTEM. In the Chinese system, there\\nare twelve main organs: the lung, large intestine, stom-\\nach, spleen, heart, small intestine, urinary bladder, kid-\\nney, liver, gallbladder, pericardium, and the “triple\\nwarmer,” which represents the entire torso region. Each\\norgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organ\\ninteracts with particular emotions on the mental level. As\\nthere are twelve organs, there are twelve types of chi\\nwhich can move through the body, and these move\\nthrough twelve main channels or meridians.

They can be useful in promoting smoother,\\neven-toned skin and may reduce the appearance of wrin-\\nkles and fine lines in some individuals.\\nAHAs are available in a number of different synthet-\\nic and natural formulations. Lactic AHA is derived from\\nmilk products, while glycolic AHA is derived from sug-\\narcane. Other AHA compounds include citric acid (from\\nfruit) and malic acid (from apples).\\nGeneral use\\nAHAs work by removing dead cells at the surface of'),\n",

They are essential to human metabolism, and to\\nmaking the human body function properly for good\\nhealth. Of the 28 amino acids known to exist, eight of\\nthem are considered “essential,” defined as those that can\\nbe obtained only through food. These essential amino\\nacids are tryptophan,lysine, methionine, phenylalaine,\\nthreonine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine. The “non–es-\\nsential” amino acids include arginine, tyrosine, glycine,\\nserine, glutmamic acid, aspartic acid, taurine, cycstine,\\nhistidine, proline, alanine, and creatine, which is a com-\\nbination of arginine, glycine, and methionine.\\nThe human body, minus water, is 75% amino acids.\\nAll of the neurotransmitters (proteins) but one are com-'),\n",

Factors such as stress, continual reading in dim\\nlighting, or excessive close-up work may also contribute\\nto the development of astigmatism. It is sometimes\\ncaused by pressure from chalazion, a condition that\\ncauses the eyelid to swell; from scars on the cornea; or\\nfrom keratoconus, a condition that involves swelling of\\nthe cornea. The main symptom of astigmatism is blurred\\nor distorted vision.

Unlimited amounts of fat and protein are allowed\\nbut carbohydrate intake is restricted to 15-20 grams per\\nday. Foods allowed include butter, oil, meat, poultry,\\nfish, eggs, cheese, and cream.

Rather than simply pre-\\nscribe lenses to compensate for eyesight weaknesses, be-\\nhavioral optometrists attempt to train the patient to see\\nbetter across a range of different circumstances.\\nOrigins\\nBehavioral optometry traces its roots to the writings\\nof Dr. William H. Bates, a New York City ophthalmolo-\\ngist. Bates began writing in the 1920s about alternatives\\nto the use of corrective lenses. He believed that many\\nphysical and emotional stresses caused vision problems,\\nand that alleviating these stresses could improve vision.\\nHe noted that modern humans spend an inordinate\\namount of time doing close work such as reading, while\\nthe human eye may have been originally adapted for dis-\\ntance vision. Bates devised a program of eye training'),\n",

The English novelist Aldous Huxley re-\\ncovered from near-blindness using Bates’s system, and\\nwrote a book about his experience. Other optometrists\\nbuilt on Bates’s insights, supplementing his research and\\nideas. Some researchers focused on the fact that the need\\nfor corrective lenses rises in proportion to a person’s\\nlevel of education. They concluded that the stress of\\nreading was probably responsible for poor eyesight. Oth-\\ners noted that vision problems increase as cultures be-\\ncome increasingly industrialized and developed. Practi-\\ntioners of behavioral optometry who built on and extend-\\ned Bates’s ideas include Dr. Raymond L. Gottlieb and\\nDr. Jacob Liberman, both influential authors and teach-\\ners. Behavioral optometrists are distinctly a minority in\\nthe field of optometry, but they can be found across the\\nUnited States and worldwide.\\nBenefits\\nBehavioral optometrists promise many benefits'),\n",
