It is the result of the body’s in-\\nflammatory response to a foreign body or a bacterial,\\nviral, parasitic, or fungal infection. An abscess usually\\ndries out and resolves when it is drained of pus. The\\nmost common parts of the body affected by abscesses\\nare the face, armpits, arms and legs, rectum, sebaceous\\nglands (oil glands), and the breast during lactation.\\nDescription\\nMost abscesses are septic, which means they are the\\nresult of an infection. Abscesses occur when white blood\\ncells (WBCs) gather in response to an infection. They pro-\\nduce oxidants (for example, superoxide radical) and en-\\nzymes to digest the invading bacteria, viruses, parasites, or\\nfungi.

This\\nhappens, for instance, at puberty when increased levels\\nof the androgen hormones cause overproduction of\\nsebum. In addition, cells lining the follicle are shed too\\nquickly and begin to clump together. The excess sebum\\ncombines with the dead cells and forms a plug, or\\ncomedo (also called comedones), that blocks the pore,\\nwhich is not usually seen. When the follicle begins to\\nbulge and show up as a small whitish bump mostly\\nunder the skin, it is called a whitehead.

Thus, acupuncture\\ntherapies seek to either increase or reduce yang, or in-\\ncrease or reduce yin in particular regions of the body.\\nCHI.

Each\\norgan has chi energy associated with it, and each organ\\ninteracts with particular emotions on the mental level.

However, it\\nwill only flourish to the point of causing athlete’s foot if\\nconditions are right. The fungi multiply on the skin when it\\nis irritated, weakened, or continuously moist. Sweaty feet,\\ntight shoes, synthetic socks that do not absorb moisture\\nwell, a warm climate, and not drying the feet well after\\nswimming or bathing, all contribute to the overgrowth of\\nthe fungus.

Rather than simply pre-\\nscribe lenses to compensate for eyesight weaknesses, be-\\nhavioral optometrists attempt to train the patient to see\\nbetter across a range of different circumstances.\\nOrigins\\nBehavioral optometry traces its roots to the writings\\nof Dr. William H. Bates, a New York City ophthalmolo-\\ngist. Bates began writing in the 1920s about alternatives\\nto the use of corrective lenses. He believed that many\\nphysical and emotional stresses caused vision problems,\\nand that alleviating these stresses could improve vision.\\nHe noted that modern humans spend an inordinate\\namount of time doing close work such as reading, while\\nthe human eye may have been originally adapted for dis-\\ntance vision.

Some researchers focused on the fact that the need\\nfor corrective lenses rises in proportion to a person’s\\nlevel of education.

Oth-\\ners noted that vision problems increase as cultures be-\\ncome increasingly industrialized and developed. Practi-\\ntioners of behavioral optometry who built on and extend-\\ned Bates’s ideas include Dr. Raymond L. Gottlieb and\\nDr. Jacob Liberman, both influential authors and teach-\\ners.
